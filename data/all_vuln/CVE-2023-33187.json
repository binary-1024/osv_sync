Highlight may record passwords on customer deployments when a password html input is switched to `type=\"text\"` via a javascript \"Show Password\" button. This differs from the expected behavior which always obfuscates `type=\"password\"` inputs. A customer may assume that switching to `type=\"text\"` would also not record this input; hence, they would not add additional `highlight-mask` css-class obfuscation to this part of the DOM, resulting in unintentional recording of a password value when a `Show Password` button is used. This issue was patched in version 6.0.0.\nThis patch tracks changes to the `type` attribute of an input to ensure an input that used to be a `type=\"password\"` continues to be obfuscated. \n","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-33187.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.0"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/highlight/highlight/security/advisories/GHSA-9qpj-qq2r-5mcc"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb/pull/1184"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
