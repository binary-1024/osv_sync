{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68949","published":"2026-01-13T18:43:20.189Z","modified":"2026-01-16T06:52:17.931145Z","aliases":["GHSA-w96v-gf22-crwp"],"summary":"n8n has a Webhook Node IP Whitelist Bypass via Partial String Matching","details":"n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. From 1.36.0 to before 2.2.0, the Webhook node’s IP whitelist validation performed partial string matching instead of exact IP comparison. As a result, an incoming request could be accepted if the source IP address merely contained the configured whitelist entry as a substring. This issue affected instances where workflow editors relied on IP-based access controls to restrict webhook access. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses were impacted. An attacker with a non-whitelisted IP could bypass restrictions if their IP shared a partial prefix with a trusted address, undermining the intended security boundary. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n","events":[{"introduced":"15fb6cbd4a75d38cadb3962f9c0194d81fc3fd35"},{"fixed":"67e25c890a7817b36190f7b679fb102864fe02c2"}]}],"versions":["n8n@1.100.0","n8n@1.101.0","n8n@1.102.0","n8n@1.103.0","n8n@1.104.0","n8n@1.105.0","n8n@1.106.0","n8n@1.107.0","n8n@1.108.0","n8n@1.109.0","n8n@1.110.0","n8n@1.111.0","n8n@1.112.0","n8n@1.113.0","n8n@1.114.0","n8n@1.115.0","n8n@1.116.0","n8n@1.117.0","n8n@1.118.0","n8n@1.119.0","n8n@1.120.0","n8n@1.121.0","n8n@1.122.0","n8n@1.123.0","n8n@1.36.0","n8n@1.37.0","n8n@1.38.0","n8n@1.39.0","n8n@1.40.0","n8n@1.41.0","n8n@1.42.0","n8n@1.43.0","n8n@1.44.0","n8n@1.45.0","n8n@1.46.0","n8n@1.47.0","n8n@1.48.0","n8n@1.49.0","n8n@1.50.0","n8n@1.51.0","n8n@1.52.0","n8n@1.53.0","n8n@1.54.0","n8n@1.55.0","n8n@1.56.0","n8n@1.57.0","n8n@1.58.0","n8n@1.59.0","n8n@1.60.0","n8n@1.61.0","n8n@1.62.1","n8n@1.63.0","n8n@1.64.0","n8n@1.65.0","n8n@1.66.0","n8n@1.67.0","n8n@1.68.0","n8n@1.69.0","n8n@1.70.0","n8n@1.71.0","n8n@1.72.0","n8n@1.73.0","n8n@1.74.0","n8n@1.75.0","n8n@1.76.0","n8n@1.77.0","n8n@1.78.0","n8n@1.79.0","n8n@1.80.0","n8n@1.81.0","n8n@1.82.0","n8n@1.83.0","n8n@1.84.0","n8n@1.85.0","n8n@1.86.0","n8n@1.87.0","n8n@1.88.0","n8n@1.89.0","n8n@1.90.0","n8n@1.91.0","n8n@1.92.0","n8n@1.93.0","n8n@1.94.0","n8n@1.95.0","n8n@1.96.0","n8n@1.97.0","n8n@1.98.0","n8n@1.99.0","n8n@2.0.0","n8n@2.0.0-rc.0","n8n@2.0.0-rc.1","n8n@2.0.0-rc.2","n8n@2.0.0-rc.3","n8n@2.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68949.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68949.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/commit/11f8597d4ad69ea3b58941573997fdbc4de1fec5"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/23399"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/23399"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/security/advisories/GHSA-w96v-gf22-crwp"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68949"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-134","CWE-284"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68949.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
