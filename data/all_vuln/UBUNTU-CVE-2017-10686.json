The related heap is allocated in the token() function and freed in the detoken() function (called by pp_getline()) - it is used again at multiple positions later that could cause multiple damages. For example, it causes a corrupted double-linked list in detoken(), a double free or corruption in delete_Token(), and an out-of-bounds write in detoken(). It has a high possibility to lead to a remote code execution attack.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nasm","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:14.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/nasm@2.10.09-1ubuntu0.1?arch=source&distro=trusty"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.10.09-1ubuntu0.1"}]}],"versions":["2.10.07-1","2.10.09-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"nasm","binary_version":"2.10.09-1ubuntu0.1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2017/UBUNTU-CVE-2017-10686.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nasm","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/nasm@2.11.08-1ubuntu0.1?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.11.08-1ubuntu0.1"}]}],"versions":["2.11.06-1really2.11.05-1","2.11.08-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"nasm","binary_version":"2.11.08-1ubuntu0.1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2017/UBUNTU-CVE-2017-10686.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2017-10686"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-3694-1"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-10686"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"low"}]}
