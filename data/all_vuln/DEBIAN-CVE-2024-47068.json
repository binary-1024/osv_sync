Versions prior to 2.79.2, 3.29.5, and 4.22.4 are susceptible to a DOM Clobbering vulnerability when bundling scripts with properties from `import.meta` (e.g., `import.meta.url`) in `cjs`/`umd`/`iife` format. The DOM Clobbering gadget can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an `img` tag with an unsanitized `name` attribute) are present. Versions 2.79.2, 3.29.5, and 4.22.4  contain a patch for the vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"node-rollup","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-rollup?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.38.4-1","2.40.0-1","2.41.2-1","2.41.5-1","2.42.1-1","2.42.1-2","2.61.1-1","2.61.1-2","2.61.1-3","2.61.1-4","2.61.1-5","2.61.1-6","2.70.2-1","2.70.2-2","2.71.1-1","2.71.1-2","2.72.1-1","2.73.0-1","2.74.1-1","2.75.3-1","2.75.5-1","2.75.6-1","2.75.7-1","2.76.0-1","2.77.0-1","2.77.2-1","2.78.0-1","2.78.1-1","2.79.0-1","2.79.1-1","3.0.0~beta~8-1","3.10.0-1","3.12.0-1","3.15.0-1","3.15.0-2","3.2.3-1","3.2.5-1","3.2.5-2","3.28.0-1","3.28.0-2","3.29.4-1","3.29.4-2","3.29.4-3","3.29.5-1","3.3.0-1","3.3.0~beta~0-1","3.4.0-1","3.7.0-1","3.7.2-1","3.7.3-1","3.7.5-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47068.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-rollup","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-rollup?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.15.0-1","3.15.0-1+deb12u1","3.15.0-2","3.28.0-1","3.28.0-2","3.29.4-1","3.29.4-2","3.29.4-3","3.29.5-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47068.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-rollup","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-rollup?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.29.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47068.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-rollup","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-rollup?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.29.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47068.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-47068"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
