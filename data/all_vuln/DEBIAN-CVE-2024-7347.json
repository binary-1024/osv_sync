The issue only affects NGINX if it is built with the ngx_http_mp4_module and the mp4 directive is used in the configuration file. Additionally, the attack is possible only if an attacker can trigger the processing of a specially crafted mp4 file with the ngx_http_mp4_module.  Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nginx","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nginx?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.18.0-6.1+deb11u4"}]}],"versions":["1.18.0-6.1","1.18.0-6.1+deb11u1","1.18.0-6.1+deb11u2","1.18.0-6.1+deb11u3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-7347.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nginx","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nginx?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.22.1-9+deb12u2"}]}],"versions":["1.22.1-9","1.22.1-9+deb12u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-7347.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nginx","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nginx?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.26.0-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-7347.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nginx","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nginx?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.26.0-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-7347.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-7347"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
