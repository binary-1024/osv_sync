Prior to version 0.5.1, when handling `<use>` tag that references an `<image>` tag, it merges the attributes from the `<use>` tag to the `<image>` tag. The problem pops up especially when the `href` attribute from the `<use>` tag has not been sanitized. This can lead to an unsafe file read that can cause PHAR Deserialization vulnerability in PHP prior to version 8. Version 0.5.1 contains a patch for this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"php-dompdf-svg-lib","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/php-dompdf-svg-lib?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.5.0-3+deb12u1"}]}],"versions":["0.5.0-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-50252.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-50252"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
