Prior to version 1.8.179, there is no check to ensure that the user is disabling notifications for the mailbox to which they already have access. Moreover, the code explicitly implements functionality that if the user does not have access to the mailbox, then after disabling (enabling) notifications for this mailbox, the user will gain access to it.
