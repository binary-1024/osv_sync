In versions prior to 0.49.0, 0.54.1, and 0.55.0, a misbehaving or malicious server can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the quic-go client by triggering an assertion failure, leading to a process crash. This requires no authentication and can be exploited during the handshake phase. This was observed in the wild with certain server implementations. quic-go needs to be able to handle misbehaving server implementations, including those that prematurely send a HANDSHAKE_DONE frame. Versions 0.49.0, 0.54.1, and 0.55.0 discard Initial keys when receiving a HANDSHAKE_DONE frame, thereby correctly handling premature HANDSHAKE_DONE frames.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"golang-github-lucas-clemente-quic-go","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-lucas-clemente-quic-go?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.19.3-1","0.24.0-1","0.25.0-1","0.26.0-1","0.26.0-1~bpo11+1","0.29.0-1","0.29.0-1~bpo11+1","0.29.0-1~bpo11+2","0.29.2-1","0.29.2-2","0.29.2-3","0.37.0-1","0.37.4-1","0.37.4-1~bpo12+1","0.38.2-1","0.38.2-2","0.46.0-1","0.46.0-2","0.46.0-2~bpo12+1","0.50.0-1","0.50.1-1","0.50.1-2","0.54.0-1","0.54.0-2","0.54.0-3","0.54.1-1","0.55.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-59530.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-lucas-clemente-quic-go","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-lucas-clemente-quic-go?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.29.0-1","0.29.2-1","0.29.2-2","0.29.2-3","0.37.0-1","0.37.4-1","0.37.4-1~bpo12+1","0.38.2-1","0.38.2-2","0.46.0-1","0.46.0-2","0.46.0-2~bpo12+1","0.50.0-1","0.50.1-1","0.50.1-2","0.54.0-1","0.54.0-2","0.54.0-3","0.54.1-1","0.55.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-59530.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-lucas-clemente-quic-go","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-lucas-clemente-quic-go?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.50.1-2","0.54.0-1","0.54.0-2","0.54.0-3","0.54.1-1","0.55.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-59530.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-lucas-clemente-quic-go","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-lucas-clemente-quic-go?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.54.1-1"}]}],"versions":["0.50.1-2","0.54.0-1","0.54.0-2","0.54.0-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-59530.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-59530"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
