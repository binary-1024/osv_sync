In this case, the copy could be leaked.  Properly free 'copy' in the error case for the allocation of 'filtered' failing.  Note that there may also have been a similar issue in kunit_filter_subsuites, before it was removed in \"kunit: flatten kunit_suite*** to kunit_suite** in .kunit_test_suites\".
