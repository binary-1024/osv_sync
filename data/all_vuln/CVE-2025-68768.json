{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68768","published":"2026-01-13T15:28:47.106Z","modified":"2026-01-13T20:02:09.912791Z","summary":"inet: frags: flush pending skbs in fqdir_pre_exit()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ninet: frags: flush pending skbs in fqdir_pre_exit()\n\nWe have been seeing occasional deadlocks on pernet_ops_rwsem since\nSeptember in NIPA. The stuck task was usually modprobe (often loading\na driver like ipvlan), trying to take the lock as a Writer.\nlockdep does not track readers for rwsems so the read wasn't obvious\nfrom the reports.\n\nOn closer inspection the Reader holding the lock was conntrack looping\nforever in nf_conntrack_cleanup_net_list(). Based on past experience\nwith occasional NIPA crashes I looked thru the tests which run before\nthe crash and noticed that the crash follows ip_defrag.sh. An immediate\nred flag. Scouring thru (de)fragmentation queues reveals skbs sitting\naround, holding conntrack references.\n\nThe problem is that since conntrack depends on nf_defrag_ipv6,\nnf_defrag_ipv6 will load first. Since nf_defrag_ipv6 loads first its\nnetns exit hooks run _after_ conntrack's netns exit hook.\n\nFlush all fragment queue SKBs during fqdir_pre_exit() to release\nconntrack references before conntrack cleanup runs. Also flush\nthe queues in timer expiry handlers when they discover fqdir->dead\nis set, in case packet sneaks in while we're running the pre_exit\nflush.\n\nThe commit under Fixes is not exactly the culprit, but I think\npreviously the timer firing would eventually unblock the spinning\nconntrack.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"d5dd88794a13c2f24cce31abad7a0a6c5e0ed2db"},{"fixed":"c70df25214ac9b32b53e18e6ae3b8f073ffa6903"},{"fixed":"006a5035b495dec008805df249f92c22c89c3d2e"}]}],"versions":["v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.2","v5.2-rc6","v5.2-rc7","v5.3","v5.3-rc1","v5.3-rc2","v5.3-rc3","v5.3-rc4","v5.3-rc5","v5.3-rc6","v5.3-rc7","v5.3-rc8","v5.4","v5.4-rc1","v5.4-rc2","v5.4-rc3","v5.4-rc4","v5.4-rc5","v5.4-rc6","v5.4-rc7","v5.4-rc8","v5.5","v5.5-rc1","v5.5-rc2","v5.5-rc3","v5.5-rc4","v5.5-rc5","v5.5-rc6","v5.5-rc7","v5.6","v5.6-rc1","v5.6-rc2","v5.6-rc3","v5.6-rc4","v5.6-rc5","v5.6-rc6","v5.6-rc7","v5.7","v5.7-rc1","v5.7-rc2","v5.7-rc3","v5.7-rc4","v5.7-rc5","v5.7-rc6","v5.7-rc7","v5.8","v5.8-rc1","v5.8-rc2","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc4","v5.8-rc5","v5.8-rc6","v5.8-rc7","v5.9","v5.9-rc1","v5.9-rc2","v5.9-rc3","v5.9-rc4","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.18","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5","v6.18-rc6","v6.18-rc7","v6.18.1","v6.18.2","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68768.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.3.0"},{"fixed":"6.18.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68768.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/006a5035b495dec008805df249f92c22c89c3d2e"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c70df25214ac9b32b53e18e6ae3b8f073ffa6903"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68768.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68768"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68768.json"}}
