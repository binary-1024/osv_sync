This can lead to\nissues where the graph walk continues and eventually fails, but the\npointer was set already.\n\nThis patch changes the logic so that the information provided to\nthe caller is set when a controller is found.","references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/385f287f9853da402d94278e59f594501c1d1dad"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cce476954401e3421afafb25bbaa926050688b1d"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
