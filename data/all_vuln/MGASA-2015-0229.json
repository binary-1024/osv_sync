  "details": "Updated moodle package fixes security vulnerabilities:\n\nIn Moodle before 2.6.11, leaving gradebook feedback is a trusted action and\nsuch capabilities in other modules already have an XSS mask, 'mod/quiz:grade'\nwas missing this flag (CVE-2015-3174).\n\nIn Moodle before 2.6.11, some error messages display a button to return to\nthe previous page. Redirecting to non-local referer should not be allowed as\nit can potentially be used for phising (CVE-2015-3175).\n\nIn Moodle before 2.6.11, on sites with enabled self-registration, not\nregistered users can retrieve fullname of registered users if they know their\nusernames (CVE-2015-3176).\n\nIn Moodle before 2.6.11, if a user who is not XSS-trusted attempts to insert\na script as part of the input text, it will be cleaned when displayed on the\nMoodle website but may be displayed uncleaned in the external application\nbecause external_format_text() cleans and formats text incorrectly when\nreturning it from Web Services (CVE-2015-3178).\n\nIn Moodle before 2.6.11, when self-registration is enabled and a user's\naccount was suspended after creating the account but before actually\nconfirming it, the user is still able to login when confirming their email,\nbut only once (CVE-2015-3179).\n\nIn Moodle before 2.6.11, if a user is enrolled in the course but his\nenrollment is suspended, they can not access the course but still were able\nto see the course structure in the navigation block (CVE-2015-3180).\n\nIn Moodle before 2.6.11, users with the revoked capability\n'moodle/user:manageownfiles' are still able to upload private files using a\ndeprecated function in Web Services (CVE-2015-3181).\n",
