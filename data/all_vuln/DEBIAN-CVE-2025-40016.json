{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-40016","published":"2025-10-20T16:15:38Z","modified":"2025-10-23T05:16:47.308239Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-40016"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: uvcvideo: Mark invalid entities with id UVC_INVALID_ENTITY_ID  Per UVC 1.1+ specification 3.7.2, units and terminals must have a non-zero unique ID.  ``` Each Unit and Terminal within the video function is assigned a unique identification number, the Unit ID (UID) or Terminal ID (TID), contained in the bUnitID or bTerminalID field of the descriptor. The value 0x00 is reserved for undefined ID, ```  If we add a new entity with id 0 or a duplicated ID, it will be marked as UVC_INVALID_ENTITY_ID.  In a previous attempt commit 3dd075fe8ebb (\"media: uvcvideo: Require entities to have a non-zero unique ID\"), we ignored all the invalid units, this broke a lot of non-compatible cameras. Hopefully we are more lucky this time.  This also prevents some syzkaller reproducers from triggering warnings due to a chain of entities referring to themselves. In one particular case, an Output Unit is connected to an Input Unit, both with the same ID of 1. But when looking up for the source ID of the Output Unit, that same entity is found instead of the input entity, which leads to such warnings.  In another case, a backward chain was considered finished as the source ID was 0. Later on, that entity was found, but its pads were not valid.  Here is a sample stack trace for one of those cases.
