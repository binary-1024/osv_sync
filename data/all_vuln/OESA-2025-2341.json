Specific vulnerability type and impact details require further confirmation.(CVE-2025-10527)\n\nThis vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143 and Firefox ESR &lt; 140.3.(CVE-2025-10528)\n\nThis vulnerability affects Firefox versions earlier than 143 and Firefox ESR versions earlier than 140.3. The vulnerability may lead to security bypass or other security issues.(CVE-2025-10529)\n\nThis vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143 and Firefox ESR &lt; 140.3.(CVE-2025-10532)\n\nThis vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.28, and Firefox ESR &lt; 140.3. Specific vulnerability details require further analysis.(CVE-2025-10533)\n\nThis vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143 and Firefox ESR &lt; 140.3.(CVE-2025-10536)\n\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox ESR 140.2, Thunderbird ESR 140.2, Firefox 142 and Thunderbird 142. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143 and Firefox ESR &lt; 140.3.(CVE-2025-10537)\n\nThunderbird cached CORS preflight responses across IP address changes. This allowed circumventing CORS with DNS rebinding.

Even if the nameless cookie was set over HTTP and the shadowed cookie included the `Secure` attribute. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 141, Firefox ESR &lt; 140.1, Thunderbird &lt; 141, and Thunderbird &lt; 140.1.(CVE-2025-8037)\n\nThunderbird ignored paths when checking the validity of navigations in a frame.

Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 141, Firefox ESR &lt; 140.1, Thunderbird &lt; 141, and Thunderbird &lt; 140.1.(CVE-2025-8040)\n\nSpoofing issue in the Address Bar component.
