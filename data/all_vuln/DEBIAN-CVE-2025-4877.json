In such cases the bin_to_base64() function can experience an integer overflow leading to a memory under allocation, when that happens it's possible that the program perform out of bounds write leading to a heap corruption. This issue affects only 32-bits builds of libssh.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libssh?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.9.8-0+deb11u2"}]}],"versions":["0.9.5-1","0.9.5-1+deb11u1","0.9.6-1","0.9.6-2","0.9.7-0+deb11u1","0.9.8-0+deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-4877.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libssh?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.10.6-0+deb12u2"}]}],"versions":["0.10.5-2","0.10.5-3","0.10.5-3+hurd.1","0.10.6-0+deb12u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-4877.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libssh?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.11.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-4877.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libssh?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.11.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-4877.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-4877"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
