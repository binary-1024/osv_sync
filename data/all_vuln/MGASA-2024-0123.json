(CVE-2024-25126)\nCarefully crafted Range headers can cause a server to respond with an\nunexpectedly large response. Responding with such large responses could\nlead to a denial of service issue. Vulnerable applications will use the\n`Rack::File` middleware or the `Rack::Utils.byte_ranges` methods (this\nincludes Rails applications).
