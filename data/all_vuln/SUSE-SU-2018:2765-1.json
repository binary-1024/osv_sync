Due to insufficient validation of administrator-supplied\n  configuration settings via the HTTP API, it was possible for a CouchDB\n  administrator user to escalate their privileges to that of the operating\n  system's user that CouchDB runs under, by bypassing the blacklist of\n  configuration settings that are not allowed to be modified via the HTTP API\n  (bsc#1100973)\n",
