{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-49767","published":"2024-10-25T20:15:04Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:19:40.695819Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-49767"],"details":"Werkzeug is a Web Server Gateway Interface web application library. Applications using `werkzeug.formparser.MultiPartParser` corresponding to a version of Werkzeug prior to 3.0.6 to parse `multipart/form-data` requests (e.g. all flask applications) are vulnerable to a relatively simple but effective resource exhaustion (denial of service) attack. A specifically crafted form submission request can cause the parser to allocate and block 3 to 8 times the upload size in main memory. There is no upper limit; a single upload at 1 Gbit/s can exhaust 32 GB of RAM in less than 60 seconds. Werkzeug version 3.0.6 fixes this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-werkzeug","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-werkzeug?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.2.2-3+deb12u1"}]}],"versions":["2.2.2-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-49767.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-werkzeug","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-werkzeug?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.3-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-49767.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-werkzeug","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-werkzeug?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.3-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-49767.json"}},{"package":{"name":"quart","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/quart?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.14.1-1","0.18.3-1","0.18.3-2","0.19.4-1","0.19.4-2","0.19.5-1","0.19.6-1","0.19.9-1","0.20.0-1","0.20.0-2","0.20.0-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-49767.json"}},{"package":{"name":"quart","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/quart?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.18.3-2","0.19.4-1","0.19.4-2","0.19.5-1","0.19.6-1","0.19.9-1","0.20.0-1","0.20.0-2","0.20.0-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-49767.json"}},{"package":{"name":"quart","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/quart?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.19.9-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-49767.json"}},{"package":{"name":"quart","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/quart?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.19.9-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-49767.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-49767"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
