{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-22606","published":"2026-01-10T01:35:00.797Z","modified":"2026-01-15T05:55:52.874232Z","aliases":["GHSA-wfq2-52f7-7qvj"],"summary":"Fickling has a bypass via runpy.run_path() and runpy.run_module()","details":"Fickling is a Python pickling decompiler and static analyzer. Fickling versions up to and including 0.1.6 do not treat Python’s runpy module as unsafe. Because of this, a malicious pickle that uses runpy.run_path() or runpy.run_module() is classified as SUSPICIOUS instead of OVERTLY_MALICIOUS. If a user relies on Fickling’s output to decide whether a pickle is safe to deserialize, this misclassification can lead them to execute attacker-controlled code on their system. This affects any workflow or product that uses Fickling as a security gate for pickle deserialization. This issue has been patched in version 0.1.7.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"977b0769c13537cd96549c12bb537f05464cf09c"}]}],"versions":["master","v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22606.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22606.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/commit/9a2b3f89bd0598b528d62c10a64c1986fcb09f66"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/releases/tag/v0.1.7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/security/advisories/GHSA-wfq2-52f7-7qvj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22606"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-184","CWE-502"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22606.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
