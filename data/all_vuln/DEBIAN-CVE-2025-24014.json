A segmentation fault was found in Vim before 9.1.1043. In silent Ex mode (-s -e), Vim typically doesn't show a screen and just operates silently in batch mode. However, it is still possible to trigger the function that handles the scrolling of a gui version of Vim by feeding some binary characters to Vim. The function that handles the scrolling however may be triggering a redraw, which will access the ScreenLines pointer, even so this variable hasn't been allocated (since there is no screen). This vulnerability is fixed in 9.1.1043.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"vim","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/vim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2:8.2.2434-3","2:8.2.2434-3+deb11u1","2:8.2.2434-3+deb11u2","2:8.2.2434-3+deb11u3","2:8.2.3455-1","2:8.2.3455-2","2:8.2.3565-1","2:8.2.3995-1","2:8.2.4659-1","2:8.2.4793-1","2:9.0.0135-1","2:9.0.0229-1","2:9.0.0242-1","2:9.0.0626-1","2:9.0.0813-1","2:9.0.1000-1","2:9.0.1000-2","2:9.0.1000-3","2:9.0.1000-4","2:9.0.1378-1","2:9.0.1378-2","2:9.0.1658-1","2:9.0.1672-1","2:9.0.1894-1","2:9.0.2018-1","2:9.0.2087-1","2:9.0.2103-1","2:9.0.2116-1","2:9.0.2189-1","2:9.1.0-1","2:9.1.0016-1","2:9.1.0199-1","2:9.1.0374-1","2:9.1.0377-1","2:9.1.0496-1","2:9.1.0698-1","2:9.1.0709-1","2:9.1.0709-2","2:9.1.0777-1","2:9.1.0861-1","2:9.1.0967-1","2:9.1.0967-2","2:9.1.1113-1","2:9.1.1230-1","2:9.1.1230-2","2:9.1.1385-1","2:9.1.1766-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-24014.json"}},{"package":{"name":"vim","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/vim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2:9.0.1378-2","2:9.0.1378-2+deb12u1","2:9.0.1378-2+deb12u2","2:9.0.1658-1","2:9.0.1672-1","2:9.0.1894-1","2:9.0.2018-1","2:9.0.2087-1","2:9.0.2103-1","2:9.0.2116-1","2:9.0.2189-1","2:9.1.0-1","2:9.1.0016-1","2:9.1.0199-1","2:9.1.0374-1","2:9.1.0377-1","2:9.1.0496-1","2:9.1.0698-1","2:9.1.0709-1","2:9.1.0709-2","2:9.1.0777-1","2:9.1.0861-1","2:9.1.0967-1","2:9.1.0967-2","2:9.1.1113-1","2:9.1.1230-1","2:9.1.1230-2","2:9.1.1385-1","2:9.1.1766-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-24014.json"}},{"package":{"name":"vim","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/vim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2:9.1.1113-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-24014.json"}},{"package":{"name":"vim","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/vim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2:9.1.1113-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-24014.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-24014"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H"}]}
