An attacker with unprivileged user access can hijack return instructions to achieve arbitrary speculative code execution under certain microarchitecture-dependent conditions.(CVE-2022-29901)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel Traffic Control (TC) subsystem. Using a specific networking configuration (redirecting egress packets to ingress using TC action &quot;mirred&quot;) a local unprivileged user could trigger a CPU soft lockup (ABBA deadlock) when the transport protocol in use (TCP or SCTP) does a retransmission, resulting in a denial of service condition.(CVE-2022-4269)\r\n\r\nA null pointer dereference issue was found in the unix protocol in net/unix/diag.c in Linux before 6.0. In unix_diag_get_exact, the newly allocated skb does not have sk, leading to null pointer. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially cause a denial of service.\r\n\r\nReference:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/netdev/CAO4mrfdvyjFpokhNsiwZiP-wpdSD0AStcJwfKcKQdAALQ9_2Qw@mail.gmail.com/\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/netdev/e04315e7c90d9a75613f3993c2baf2d344eef7eb.camel@redhat.com/\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20221127012412.37969-3-kuniyu@amazon.com/T/(CVE-2023-28327)\r\n\r\n\nKernel: A denial of service issue in  az6027 driver in\ndrivers/media/usb/dev-usb/az6027.c(CVE-2023-28328)\r\n\r\nA slab-out-of-bound read problem was found in brcmf_get_assoc_ies in drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/cfg80211.c in the Linux Kernel. This issue could occur when assoc_info-&gt;req_len data is bigger than the size of the buffer, defined as WL_EXTRA_BUF_MAX, leading to a denial of service.(CVE-2023-1380)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in KVM. When calling the KVM_GET_DEBUGREGS ioctl, on 32-bit systems, there might be some uninitialized portions of the kvm_debugregs structure that could be copied to userspace, causing an information leak.(CVE-2023-1513)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kernel","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/kernel&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["bpftool-debuginfo-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","perf-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","kernel-headers-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","kernel-devel-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","kernel-source-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","kernel-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["kernel-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["bpftool-debuginfo-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","kernel-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","kernel-headers-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","kernel-source-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","kernel-devel-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","perf-5.10.0-60.89.0.113.oe2203.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2023-1210.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2023-1210"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29901"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4269"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28327"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28328"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1380"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1513"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
