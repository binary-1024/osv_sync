This issue may allow a local attacker with user privilege to cause a denial of service.(CVE-2023-1582)\r\n\r\nA use-after-free flaw was found in btrfs_search_slot in fs/btrfs/ctree.c in btrfs in the Linux Kernel.This flaw allows an attacker to crash the system and possibly cause a kernel information lea(CVE-2023-1611)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel&apos;s implementation of RDMA over infiniband. An attacker with a privileged local account can leak kernel stack information when issuing commands to the /dev/infiniband/rdma_cm device node. While this access is unlikely to leak sensitive user information, it can be further used to defeat existing kernel protection mechanisms.(CVE-2021-3923)\r\n\r\nA flaw that boot CPU could be vulnerable for the speculative execution behavior kind of attacks in the Linux kernel X86 CPU Power management options functionality was found in the way user resuming CPU from suspend-to-RAM. A local user could use this flaw to potentially get unauthorized access to some memory of the CPU similar to the speculative execution behavior kind of attacks.(CVE-2023-1637)\r\n\r\nA flaw use after free in the Linux kernel Xircom 16-bit PCMCIA (PC-card) Ethernet driver was found.A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2023-1670)\r\n\r\nA use-after-free flaw was found in vhost_net_set_backend in drivers/vhost/net.c in virtio network subcomponent in the Linux kernel due to a double fget. This flaw could allow a local attacker to crash the system, and could even lead to a kernel information leak problem.(CVE-2023-1838)\r\n\r\nA use-after-free flaw was found in xgene_hwmon_remove in drivers/hwmon/xgene-hwmon.c in the Hardware Monitoring Linux Kernel Driver (xgene-hwmon). This flaw could allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a race problem. This vulnerability could even lead to a kernel information leak problem.(CVE-2023-1855)\r\n\r\nA use-after-free flaw was found in xen_9pfs_front_removet in net/9p/trans_xen.c in Xen transport for 9pfs in the Linux Kernel. This flaw could allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a race problem, possibly leading to a kernel information leak.(CVE-2023-1859)",
