It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++ (or other languages, depending on the chosen implementation). Python is also usable as an extension language for applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use scripting or automation interfaces.\\r\\n\\r\\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\\r\\n\\r\\n\r\nPython 3.x through 3.9.1 has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c, which may lead to remote code execution in certain Python applications that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted input, as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to c_double.from_param. This occurs because sprintf is used unsafely.(CVE-2021-3177)\\r\\n\\r\\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python3&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.9-6.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python3-debug-3.7.9-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-devel-3.7.9-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.7.9-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.7.9-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-3.7.9-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["python3-help-3.7.9-6.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["python3-3.7.9-6.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python3-debug-3.7.9-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-devel-3.7.9-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.7.9-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-3.7.9-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.7.9-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1036.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1036"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3177"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Critical"}}
