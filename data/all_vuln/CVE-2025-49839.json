{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-49839","published":"2025-07-15T20:40:18Z","modified":"2025-11-16T19:51:45.977750Z","summary":"GHSL-2025-051: GPT-SoVITS Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability","details":"GPT-SoVITS-WebUI is a voice conversion and text-to-speech webUI. In versions 20250228v3 and prior, there is an unsafe deserialization vulnerability in bsroformer.py. The model_choose variable takes user input (e.g. a path to a model) and passes it to the uvr function. In uvr, a new instance of Roformer_Loader class is created with the model_path attribute containing the aformentioned user input (here called locally model_name). Note that in this step the .ckpt extension is added to the path. In the Roformer_Loader class, the user input, here called model_path, is used to load the model on that path with torch.load, which can lead to unsafe deserialization. At time of publication, no known patched versions are available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rvc-boss/gpt-sovits","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"4fd57b0ea776d396f202e13be180b4c02e4dd957"}]}],"versions":["20240821v2","20250228v3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-49839.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS/blob/165882d64f474b3563fa91adc1a679436ae9c3b8/tools/uvr5/bsroformer.py#L289"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS/blob/165882d64f474b3563fa91adc1a679436ae9c3b8/tools/uvr5/webui.py#L157"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS/blob/165882d64f474b3563fa91adc1a679436ae9c3b8/tools/uvr5/webui.py#L192-L205"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS/blob/165882d64f474b3563fa91adc1a679436ae9c3b8/tools/uvr5/webui.py#L52-L59"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2025-049_GHSL-2025-053_RVC-Boss_GPT-SoVITS/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-502"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
