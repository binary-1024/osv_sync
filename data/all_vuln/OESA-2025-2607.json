It handles all requests in a single, non-blocking, I/O-driven process and keeps meta data and implements negative caching of failed requests.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nSquid is a caching proxy for the Web. In Squid versions prior to 7.2, a failure to redact HTTP authentication credentials in error handling allows information disclosure. The vulnerability allows a script to bypass browser security protections and learn the credentials a trusted client uses to authenticate. This potentially allows a remote client to identify security tokens or credentials used internally by a web application using Squid for backend load balancing. These attacks do not require Squid to be configured with HTTP authentication. The vulnerability is fixed in version 7.2. As a workaround, disable debug information in administrator mailto links generated by Squid by configuring squid.conf with email_err_data off.(CVE-2025-62168)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"squid","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/squid&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.6-6.oe2403sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["squid-6.6-6.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","squid-debuginfo-6.6-6.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","squid-debugsource-6.6-6.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["squid-6.6-6.oe2403sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["squid-6.6-6.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","squid-debuginfo-6.6-6.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","squid-debugsource-6.6-6.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2607.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2607"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62168"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Critical"}}
