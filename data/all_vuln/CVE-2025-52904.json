{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-52904","published":"2025-06-26T18:21:03Z","modified":"2025-11-09T19:33:38Z","aliases":["GHSA-hc8f-m8g5-8362","GO-2025-3793"],"summary":"File Browser: Command Execution not Limited to Scope","details":"File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. In version 2.32.0 of the web application, all users have a scope assigned, and they only have access to the files within that scope. The Command Execution feature of Filebrowser allows the execution of shell commands which are not restricted to the scope, potentially giving an attacker read and write access to all files managed by the server. Until this issue is fixed, the maintainers recommend to completely disable `Execute commands` for all accounts. Since the command execution is an inherently dangerous feature that is not used by all deployments, it should be possible to completely disable it in the application's configuration. As a defense-in-depth measure, organizations not requiring command execution should operate the Filebrowser from a distroless container image. A patch version has been pushed to disable the feature for all existent installations, and making it opt-in. A warning has been added to the documentation and is printed on the console if the feature is enabled. Due to the project being in maintenance-only mode, the bug has not been fixed. Fix is tracked on pull request 5199.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-52904.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/issues/5199"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/security/advisories/GHSA-hc8f-m8g5-8362"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://sloonz.github.io/posts/sandboxing-1"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-77"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
