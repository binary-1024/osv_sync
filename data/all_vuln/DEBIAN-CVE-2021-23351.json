{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2021-23351","published":"2021-03-08T05:15:12Z","modified":"2025-09-30T03:54:19Z","upstream":["CVE-2021-23351"],"details":"The package github.com/pires/go-proxyproto before 0.5.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) via the parseVersion1() function. The reader in this package is a default bufio.Reader wrapping a net.Conn. It will read from the connection until it finds a newline. Since no limits are implemented in the code, a deliberately malformed V1 header could be used to exhaust memory in a server process using this code - and create a DoS. This can be exploited by sending a stream starting with PROXY and continuing to send data (which does not contain a newline) until the target stops acknowledging. The risk here is small, because only trusted sources should be allowed to send proxy protocol headers.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"golang-github-pires-go-proxyproto","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-pires-go-proxyproto?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.4.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-23351.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-pires-go-proxyproto","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-pires-go-proxyproto?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.4.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-23351.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-pires-go-proxyproto","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-pires-go-proxyproto?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.4.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-23351.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-pires-go-proxyproto","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-pires-go-proxyproto?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.4.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-23351.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-23351"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
