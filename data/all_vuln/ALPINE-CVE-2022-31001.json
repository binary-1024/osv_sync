Prior to version 1.13.8, an attacker can send a message with evil sdp to FreeSWITCH, which may cause crash. This type of crash may be caused by `#define MATCH(s, m) (strncmp(s, m, n = sizeof(m) - 1) == 0)`, which will make `n` bigger and trigger out-of-bound access when `IS_NON_WS(s[n])`. Version 1.13.8 contains a patch for this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"sofia-sip","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/sofia-sip?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.13.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.13.2-r0","1.13.3-r0","1.13.4-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-31001.json"}},{"package":{"name":"sofia-sip","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/sofia-sip?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.13.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.13.2-r0","1.13.3-r0","1.13.4-r0","1.13.4-r1","1.13.4-r2","1.13.6-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-31001.json"}},{"package":{"name":"sofia-sip","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/sofia-sip?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.13.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.13.2-r0","1.13.3-r0","1.13.4-r0","1.13.4-r1","1.13.4-r2","1.13.6-r0","1.13.7-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-31001.json"}},{"package":{"name":"sofia-sip","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/sofia-sip?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.13.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.13.2-r0","1.13.3-r0","1.13.4-r0","1.13.4-r1","1.13.4-r2","1.13.6-r0","1.13.7-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-31001.json"}},{"package":{"name":"sofia-sip","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/sofia-sip?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.13.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.13.2-r0","1.13.3-r0","1.13.4-r0","1.13.4-r1","1.13.4-r2","1.13.6-r0","1.13.7-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-31001.json"}},{"package":{"name":"sofia-sip","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/sofia-sip?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.13.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.13.2-r0","1.13.3-r0","1.13.4-r0","1.13.4-r1","1.13.4-r2","1.13.6-r0","1.13.7-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-31001.json"}},{"package":{"name":"sofia-sip","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/sofia-sip?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.13.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.13.2-r0","1.13.3-r0","1.13.4-r0","1.13.4-r1","1.13.4-r2","1.13.6-r0","1.13.7-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-31001.json"}},{"package":{"name":"sofia-sip","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/sofia-sip?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.13.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.13.2-r0","1.13.3-r0","1.13.4-r0","1.13.4-r1","1.13.4-r2","1.13.6-r0","1.13.7-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-31001.json"}},{"package":{"name":"sofia-sip","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/sofia-sip?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.13.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.13.2-r0","1.13.3-r0","1.13.4-r0","1.13.4-r1","1.13.4-r2","1.13.6-r0","1.13.7-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-31001.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2022-31001"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
