{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2018-16152","published":"2018-09-26T21:29:01Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:10:51.994532Z","upstream":["CVE-2018-16152"],"details":"In verify_emsa_pkcs1_signature() in gmp_rsa_public_key.c in the gmp plugin in strongSwan 4.x and 5.x before 5.7.0, the RSA implementation based on GMP does not reject excess data in the digestAlgorithm.parameters field during PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification. Consequently, a remote attacker can forge signatures when small public exponents are being used, which could lead to impersonation when only an RSA signature is used for IKEv2 authentication. This is a variant of CVE-2006-4790 and CVE-2014-1568.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"strongswan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/strongswan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.7.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.5.2-r0","4.6.1-r0","5.1.1-r0","5.1.1-r1","5.1.1-r2","5.1.1-r3","5.1.3-r0","5.2.0-r0","5.2.0-r1","5.2.0-r2","5.2.2-r0","5.3.0-r0","5.3.0-r1","5.3.0-r2","5.3.1-r1","5.3.1-r2","5.3.2-r0","5.3.2-r1","5.3.2-r10","5.3.2-r2","5.3.2-r3","5.3.2-r4","5.3.2-r5","5.3.2-r6","5.3.2-r7","5.3.2-r8","5.3.2-r9","5.3.3-r0","5.3.4-r0","5.3.5-r0","5.3.5-r1","5.3.5-r2","5.4.0-r0","5.4.0-r1","5.5.0-r0","5.5.0-r1","5.5.1-r0","5.5.1-r1","5.5.2-r0","5.5.2-r1","5.5.3-r0","5.5.3-r1","5.6.0-r0","5.6.0-r1","5.6.1-r0","5.6.2-r0","5.6.2-r1","5.6.3-r0","5.6.3-r1","5.6.3-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-16152.json"}},{"package":{"name":"strongswan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/strongswan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.7.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.5.2-r0","4.6.1-r0","5.1.1-r0","5.1.1-r1","5.1.1-r2","5.1.1-r3","5.1.3-r0","5.2.0-r0","5.2.0-r1","5.2.0-r2","5.2.2-r0","5.3.0-r0","5.3.0-r1","5.3.0-r2","5.3.1-r1","5.3.1-r2","5.3.2-r0","5.3.2-r1","5.3.2-r10","5.3.2-r2","5.3.2-r3","5.3.2-r4","5.3.2-r5","5.3.2-r6","5.3.2-r7","5.3.2-r8","5.3.2-r9","5.3.3-r0","5.3.4-r0","5.3.5-r0","5.3.5-r1","5.3.5-r2","5.4.0-r0","5.4.0-r1","5.5.0-r0","5.5.0-r1","5.5.1-r0","5.5.1-r1","5.5.2-r0","5.5.2-r1","5.5.3-r0","5.5.3-r1","5.6.0-r0","5.6.0-r1","5.6.1-r0","5.6.2-r0","5.6.2-r1","5.6.3-r0","5.6.3-r1","5.6.3-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-16152.json"}},{"package":{"name":"strongswan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/strongswan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.7.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.5.2-r0","4.6.1-r0","5.1.1-r0","5.1.1-r1","5.1.1-r2","5.1.1-r3","5.1.3-r0","5.2.0-r0","5.2.0-r1","5.2.0-r2","5.2.2-r0","5.3.0-r0","5.3.0-r1","5.3.0-r2","5.3.1-r1","5.3.1-r2","5.3.2-r0","5.3.2-r1","5.3.2-r10","5.3.2-r2","5.3.2-r3","5.3.2-r4","5.3.2-r5","5.3.2-r6","5.3.2-r7","5.3.2-r8","5.3.2-r9","5.3.3-r0","5.3.4-r0","5.3.5-r0","5.3.5-r1","5.3.5-r2","5.4.0-r0","5.4.0-r1","5.5.0-r0","5.5.0-r1","5.5.1-r0","5.5.1-r1","5.5.2-r0","5.5.2-r1","5.5.3-r0","5.5.3-r1","5.6.0-r0","5.6.0-r1","5.6.1-r0","5.6.2-r0","5.6.2-r1","5.6.3-r0","5.6.3-r1","5.6.3-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-16152.json"}},{"package":{"name":"strongswan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/strongswan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.7.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.5.2-r0","4.6.1-r0","5.1.1-r0","5.1.1-r1","5.1.1-r2","5.1.1-r3","5.1.3-r0","5.2.0-r0","5.2.0-r1","5.2.0-r2","5.2.2-r0","5.3.0-r0","5.3.0-r1","5.3.0-r2","5.3.1-r1","5.3.1-r2","5.3.2-r0","5.3.2-r1","5.3.2-r10","5.3.2-r2","5.3.2-r3","5.3.2-r4","5.3.2-r5","5.3.2-r6","5.3.2-r7","5.3.2-r8","5.3.2-r9","5.3.3-r0","5.3.4-r0","5.3.5-r0","5.3.5-r1","5.3.5-r2","5.4.0-r0","5.4.0-r1","5.5.0-r0","5.5.0-r1","5.5.1-r0","5.5.1-r1","5.5.2-r0","5.5.2-r1","5.5.3-r0","5.5.3-r1","5.6.0-r0","5.6.0-r1","5.6.1-r0","5.6.2-r0","5.6.2-r1","5.6.3-r0","5.6.3-r1","5.6.3-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-16152.json"}},{"package":{"name":"strongswan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/strongswan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.7.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.5.2-r0","4.6.1-r0","5.1.1-r0","5.1.1-r1","5.1.1-r2","5.1.1-r3","5.1.3-r0","5.2.0-r0","5.2.0-r1","5.2.0-r2","5.2.2-r0","5.3.0-r0","5.3.0-r1","5.3.0-r2","5.3.1-r1","5.3.1-r2","5.3.2-r0","5.3.2-r1","5.3.2-r10","5.3.2-r2","5.3.2-r3","5.3.2-r4","5.3.2-r5","5.3.2-r6","5.3.2-r7","5.3.2-r8","5.3.2-r9","5.3.3-r0","5.3.4-r0","5.3.5-r0","5.3.5-r1","5.3.5-r2","5.4.0-r0","5.4.0-r1","5.5.0-r0","5.5.0-r1","5.5.1-r0","5.5.1-r1","5.5.2-r0","5.5.2-r1","5.5.3-r0","5.5.3-r1","5.6.0-r0","5.6.0-r1","5.6.1-r0","5.6.2-r0","5.6.2-r1","5.6.3-r0","5.6.3-r1","5.6.3-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-16152.json"}},{"package":{"name":"strongswan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/strongswan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.7.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.5.2-r0","4.6.1-r0","5.1.1-r0","5.1.1-r1","5.1.1-r2","5.1.1-r3","5.1.3-r0","5.2.0-r0","5.2.0-r1","5.2.0-r2","5.2.2-r0","5.3.0-r0","5.3.0-r1","5.3.0-r2","5.3.1-r1","5.3.1-r2","5.3.2-r0","5.3.2-r1","5.3.2-r10","5.3.2-r2","5.3.2-r3","5.3.2-r4","5.3.2-r5","5.3.2-r6","5.3.2-r7","5.3.2-r8","5.3.2-r9","5.3.3-r0","5.3.4-r0","5.3.5-r0","5.3.5-r1","5.3.5-r2","5.4.0-r0","5.4.0-r1","5.5.0-r0","5.5.0-r1","5.5.1-r0","5
