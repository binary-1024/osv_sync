  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net_sched: hfsc: Address reentrant enqueue adding class to eltree twice  Savino says:     \"We are writing to report that this recent patch     (141d34391abbb315d68556b7c67ad97885407547) [1]     can be bypassed, and a UAF can still occur when HFSC is utilized with     NETEM.      The patch only checks the cl->cl_nactive field to determine whether     it is the first insertion or not [2], but this field is only     incremented by init_vf [3].      By using HFSC_RSC (which uses init_ed) [4], it is possible to bypass the     check and insert the class twice in the eltree.     Under normal conditions, this would lead to an infinite loop in     hfsc_dequeue for the reasons we already explained in this report [5].      However, if TBF is added as root qdisc and it is configured with a     very low rate,     it can be utilized to prevent packets from being dequeued.     This behavior can be exploited to perform subsequent insertions in the     HFSC eltree and cause a UAF.\"  To fix both the UAF and the infinite loop, with netem as an hfsc child, check explicitly in hfsc_enqueue whether the class is already in the eltree whenever the HFSC_RSC flag is set.
