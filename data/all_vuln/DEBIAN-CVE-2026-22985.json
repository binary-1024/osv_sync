Move RSS LUT initialization from ndo_open to vport creation to ensure LUT is always available. This enables RSS configuration via ethtool before bringing the interface up. Simplify LUT management by maintaining all changes in the driver's soft copy and programming zeros to the indirection table when rxhash is disabled. Defer HW programming until the interface comes up if it is down during rxhash and LUT configuration changes.  Steps to reproduce: ** Load idpf driver; interfaces will be created \tmodprobe idpf ** Before bringing the interfaces up, turn rxhash off \tethtool -K eth2 rxhash off  [89408.371875] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000 [89408.371908] #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode [89408.371924] #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page [89408.371940] PGD 0 P4D 0 [89408.371953] Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI <snip> [89408.372052] RIP: 0010:memcpy_orig+0x16/0x130 [89408.372310] Call Trace: [89408.372317]  <TASK> [89408.372326]  ? idpf_set_features+0xfc/0x180 [idpf] [89408.372363]  __netdev_update_features+0x295/0xde0 [89408.372384]  ethnl_set_features+0x15e/0x460 [89408.372406]  genl_family_rcv_msg_doit+0x11f/0x180 [89408.372429]  genl_rcv_msg+0x1ad/0x2b0 [89408.372446]  ? __pfx_ethnl_set_features+0x10/0x10 [89408.372465]  ? __pfx_genl_rcv_msg+0x10/0x10 [89408.372482]  netlink_rcv_skb+0x58/0x100 [89408.372502]  genl_rcv+0x2c/0x50 [89408.372516]  netlink_unicast+0x289/0x3e0 [89408.372533]  netlink_sendmsg+0x215/0x440 [89408.372551]  __sys_sendto+0x234/0x240 [89408.372571]  __x64_sys_sendto+0x28/0x30 [89408.372585]  x64_sys_call+0x1909/0x1da0 [89408.372604]  do_syscall_64+0x7a/0xfa0 [89408.373140]  ? clear_bhb_loop+0x60/0xb0 [89408.373647]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e [89408.378887]  </TASK> <snip>","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.57-1","6.12.57-1~bpo12+1","6.12.63-1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.10-1","6.16.11-1","6.16.12-1","6.16.12-1~bpo13+1","6.16.12-2","6.16.3-1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16.5-1","6.16.6-1","6.16.7-1","6.16.8-1","6.16.9-1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1","6.17.10-1","6.17.11-1","6.17.12-1","6.17.13-1","6.17.13-1~bpo13+1","6.17.2-1~exp1","6.17.5-1~exp1","6.17.6-1","6.17.7-1","6.17.7-2","6.17.8-1","6.17.8-1~bpo13+1","6.17.9-1","6.18.1-1~exp1","6.18.2-1~exp1","6.18.3-1","6.18.5-1","6.18~rc4-1~exp1","6.18~rc4-1~exp2","6.18~rc5-1~exp1","6.18~rc6-1~exp1","6.18~rc7-1~exp1","6.19~rc4-1~exp1","6.19~rc5-1~exp1","6.19~rc6-1~exp1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22985.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.57-1","6.12.57-1~bpo12+1","6.12.63-1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.10-1","6.16.11-1","6.16.12-1","6.16.12-1~bpo13+1","6.16.12-2","6.16.3-1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16.5-1","6.16.6-1","6.16.7-1","6.16.8-1","6.16.9-1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1","6.17.10-1","6.17.11-1","6.17.12-1","6.17.13-1","6.17.13-1~bpo13+1","6.17.2-1~exp1","6.17.5-1~exp1","6.17.6-1","6.17.7-1","6.17.7-2","6.17.8-1","6.17.8-1~bpo13+1","6.17.9-1","6.18.1-1~exp1","6.18.2-1~exp1","6.18.3-1","6.18.5-1","6.18~rc4-1~exp1","6.18~rc4-1~exp2","6.18~rc5-1~exp1","6.18~rc6-1~exp1","6.18~rc7-1~exp1","6.19~rc4-1~exp1","6.19~rc5-1~exp1","6.19~rc6-1~exp1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22985.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2026-22985"}]}
