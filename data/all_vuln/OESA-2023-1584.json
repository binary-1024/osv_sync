A user located in the local network or with a high bandwidth connection can increase the CPU usage of the server that accepts IPV6 connections up to 95%.(CVE-2023-1206)\r\n\r\nA buffer overrun vulnerability was found in the netback driver in Xen due to an unusual split packet. This flaw allows an unprivileged guest to cause a denial of service (DoS) of the host by sending network packets to the backend, causing the backend to crash.(CVE-2023-34319)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in l2cap_sock_release in net/bluetooth/l2cap_sock.c in the Linux kernel before 6.4.10. There is a use-after-free because the children of an sk are mishandled.(CVE-2023-40283)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel&apos;s TUN/TAP functionality. This issue could allow a local user to bypass network filters and gain unauthorized access to some resources. The original patches fixing CVE-2023-1076 are incorrect or incomplete. The problem is that the following upstream commits - a096ccca6e50 (&quot;tun: tun_chr_open(): correctly initialize socket uid&quot;), - 66b2c338adce (&quot;tap: tap_open(): correctly initialize socket uid&quot;), pass &quot;inode-&gt;i_uid&quot; to sock_init_data_uid() as the last parameter and that turns out to not be accurate.(CVE-2023-4194)\r\n\r\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in dbFree in fs/jfs/jfs_dmap.c in the journaling file system (JFS) in the Linux Kernel. This issue may allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a missing sanity check.(CVE-2023-4385)\r\n\r\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in vmxnet3_rq_cleanup in drivers/net/vmxnet3/vmxnet3_drv.c in the networking sub-component in vmxnet3 in the Linux Kernel. This issue may allow a local attacker with normal user privilege to cause a denial of service due to a missing sanity check during cleanup.(CVE-2023-4459)",
