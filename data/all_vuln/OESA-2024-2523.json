  "details": "Mozilla Firefox is a standalone web browser, designed for standards compliance and performance.  Its functionality can be enhanced via a plethora of extensions.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser, designed for standards compliance, performance and portability.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn attacker could cause a select dropdown to be shown over another tab; this could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 133, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.5, Thunderbird &lt; 133, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.5.(CVE-2024-11692)\r\n\r\nEnhanced Tracking Protection&apos;s Strict mode may have inadvertently allowed a CSP `frame-src` bypass and DOM-based XSS through the Google SafeFrame shim in the Web Compatibility extension. This issue could have exposed users to malicious frames masquerading as legitimate content. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 133, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.5, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.18, Thunderbird &lt; 133, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.5.(CVE-2024-11694)\r\n\r\nA crafted URL containing Arabic script and whitespace characters could have hidden the true origin of the page, resulting in a potential spoofing attack. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 133, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.5, Thunderbird &lt; 133, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.5.(CVE-2024-11695)\r\n\r\nThe application failed to account for exceptions thrown by the `loadManifestFromFile` method during add-on signature verification. This flaw, triggered by an invalid or unsupported extension manifest, could have caused runtime errors that disrupted the signature validation process. As a result, the enforcement of signature validation for unrelated add-ons may have been bypassed.  Signature validation in this context is used to ensure that third-party applications on the user&apos;s computer have not tampered with the user&apos;s extensions, limiting the impact of this issue. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 133, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.5, Thunderbird &lt; 133, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.5.(CVE-2024-11696)\r\n\r\nWhen handling keypress events, an attacker may have been able to trick a user into bypassing the &quot;Open Executable File?&quot; confirmation dialog. This could have led to malicious code execution. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 133, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.5, Thunderbird &lt; 133, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.5.(CVE-2024-11697)\r\n\r\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 132, Firefox ESR 128.4, and Thunderbird 128.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 133, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.5, Thunderbird &lt; 133, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.5.(CVE-2024-11699)\r\n\r\nA type check was missing when handling fonts in PDF.js, which would allow arbitrary JavaScript execution in the PDF.js context. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 126, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.11, and Thunderbird &lt; 115.11.(CVE-2024-4367)",
