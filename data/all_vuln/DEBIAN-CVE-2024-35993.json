This can't happen if the caller holds a refcount on it, but we have a few places (memory-failure, compaction, procfs) which do not and should not take a speculative reference.  Since hugetlb pages do not use individual page mapcounts (they are always fully mapped and use the entire_mapcount field to record the number of mappings), the PageType field is available now that page_mapcount() ignores the value in this field.  In compaction and with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM enabled, the current implementation can result in an oops, as reported by Luis. This happens since 9c5ccf2db04b (\"mm: remove HUGETLB_PAGE_DTOR\") effectively added some VM_BUG_ON() checks in the PageHuge() testing path.
