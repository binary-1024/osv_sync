  "details": "PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads. This package provides the essential shared library for any PostgreSQL client program or interface.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\nA flaw was found in postgresql. A purpose-crafted query can read arbitrary bytes of server memory. In the default configuration, any authenticated database user can complete this attack at will. The attack does not require the ability to create objects. If server settings include max_worker_processes=0, the known versions of this attack are infeasible. However, undiscovered variants of the attack may be independent of that setting.(CVE-2021-3677)\n\r\nA man-in-the-middle attacker can inject false responses to the client s first few queries, despite the use of SSL certificate verification and encryption.(CVE-2021-23222)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in postgresql. Using an INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE command on a purpose-crafted table, an authenticated database user could read arbitrary bytes of server memory. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.(CVE-2021-32028)",
