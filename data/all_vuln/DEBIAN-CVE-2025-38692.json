  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  exfat: add cluster chain loop check for dir  An infinite loop may occur if the following conditions occur due to file system corruption.  (1) Condition for exfat_count_dir_entries() to loop infinitely.     - The cluster chain includes a loop.     - There is no UNUSED entry in the cluster chain.  (2) Condition for exfat_create_upcase_table() to loop infinitely.     - The cluster chain of the root directory includes a loop.     - There are no UNUSED entry and up-case table entry in the cluster       chain of the root directory.  (3) Condition for exfat_load_bitmap() to loop infinitely.     - The cluster chain of the root directory includes a loop.     - There are no UNUSED entry and bitmap entry in the cluster chain       of the root directory.  (4) Condition for exfat_find_dir_entry() to loop infinitely.     - The cluster chain includes a loop.     - The unused directory entries were exhausted by some operation.  (5) Condition for exfat_check_dir_empty() to loop infinitely.     - The cluster chain includes a loop.     - The unused directory entries were exhausted by some operation.     - All files and sub-directories under the directory are deleted.  This commit adds checks to break the above infinite loop.",
