  "details": "Multiple flaws were discovered in the RMI and Hotspot components in\nOpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws\nto completely bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-10285,\nCVE-2017-10346)\n\nIt was discovered that the Kerberos client implementation in the\nLibraries component of OpenJDK used the sname field from the plain text\npart rather than encrypted part of the KDC reply message. A man-in-the-\nmiddle attacker could possibly use this flaw to impersonate Kerberos\nservices to Java applications acting as Kerberos clients.\n(CVE-2017-10388)\n\nIt was discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK generated weak\npassword-based encryption keys used to protect private keys stored in\nkey stores. This made it easier to perform password guessing attacks to\ndecrypt stored keys if an attacker could gain access to a key store.\n(CVE-2017-10356)\n\nA flaw was found in the Smart Card IO component in OpenJDK. An untrusted\nJava application or applet could use this flaw to bypass certain Java\nsandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-10274)\n\nIt was found that the FtpClient implementation in the Networking\ncomponent of OpenJDK did not set connect and read timeouts by default.\nA malicious FTP server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could use this\nflaw to block execution of a Java application connecting to an FTP\nserver. (CVE-2017-10355)\n\nIt was found that the HttpURLConnection and HttpsURLConnection classes\nin the Networking component of OpenJDK failed to check for newline\ncharacters embedded in URLs. An attacker able to make a Java application\nperform an HTTP request using an attacker provided URL could possibly\ninject additional headers into the request. (CVE-2017-10295)\n\nIt was discovered that multiple classes in the JAXP, Serialization,\nLibraries, and JAX-WS components of OpenJDK did not limit the amount of\nmemory allocated when creating object instances from the serialized\nform. A specially-crafted input could cause a Java application to use an\nexcessive amount of memory when deserialized.
