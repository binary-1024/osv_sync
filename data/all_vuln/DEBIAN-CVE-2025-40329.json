CPU1 is executing drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_cb() as a fence signalling callback so in an interrupt context. It will deadlock when trying to grab the xa_lock which is already held by CPU0.  Replacing all xa_* usage by their xa_*_irq counterparts would fix this issue, but Christian pointed out another issue: dma_fence_signal takes fence.lock and so does dma_fence_add_callback.    dma_fence_signal() // locks f1.lock   -> drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_cb()   -> foreach dependencies      -> dma_fence_add_callback() // locks f2.lock  This will deadlock if f1 and f2 share the same spinlock.  To fix both issues, the code iterating on dependencies and re-arming them is moved out to drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_work().
