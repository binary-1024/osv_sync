Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.4.1, if an application accepts a map file from an untrusted source, an attacker can supply a `repoName` containing traversal (e.g., `../escaped-repo`) and cause go-tuf to create directories and write the root metadata file outside the intended `LocalMetadataDir` cache base, within the running process's filesystem permissions. Version 2.4.1 contains a patch.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf","events":[{"introduced":"ecec5d3a09cfa74482f0797fa38b65a2942a655c"},{"fixed":"d361e2ea24e427581343dee5c7a32b485d79fcc0"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.4.1"}]}}],"versions":["v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.4.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24686.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24686.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/commit/d361e2ea24e427581343dee5c7a32b485d79fcc0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/security/advisories/GHSA-jqc5-w2xx-5vq4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24686"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-22"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24686.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
