  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: Don't process extts if PTP is disabled  The ice_ptp_extts_event() function can race with ice_ptp_release() and result in a NULL pointer dereference which leads to a kernel panic.  Panic occurs because the ice_ptp_extts_event() function calls ptp_clock_event() with a NULL pointer. The ice driver has already released the PTP clock by the time the interrupt for the next external timestamp event occurs.  To fix this, modify the ice_ptp_extts_event() function to check the PTP state and bail early if PTP is not ready.",
