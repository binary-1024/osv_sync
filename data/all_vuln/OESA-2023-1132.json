It ties database tables and classes together for business objects, like Customer or Subscription, that can find, save, and destroy themselves without resorting to manual SQL.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA denial of service vulnerability present in ActiveRecord&apos;s PostgreSQL adapter &lt;7.0.4.1 and &lt;6.1.7.1. When a value outside the range for a 64bit signed integer is provided to the PostgreSQL connection adapter, it will treat the target column type as numeric. Comparing integer values against numeric values can result in a slow sequential scan resulting in potential Denial of Service.(CVE-2022-44566)\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in ActiveRecord &lt;6.0.6.1, v6.1.7.1 and v7.0.4.1 related to the sanitization of comments. If malicious user input is passed to either the `annotate` query method, the `optimizer_hints` query method, or through the QueryLogs interface which automatically adds annotations, it may be sent to the database withinsufficient sanitization and be able to inject SQL outside of the comment.(CVE-2023-22794)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"rubygem-activerecord","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/rubygem-activerecord&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.4.1-2.oe2203"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"noarch":["rubygem-activerecord-doc-6.1.4.1-2.oe2203.noarch.rpm","rubygem-activerecord-6.1.4.1-2.oe2203.noarch.rpm"],"src":["rubygem-activerecord-6.1.4.1-2.oe2203.src.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2023-1132.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2023-1132"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-44566"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22794"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
