It is often referred to as a dattructure server since keys can contain strings, hashes ,lists, sets anorted sets.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nRedis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In affected versions specially crafted Lua scripts executing in Redis can cause the heap-based Lua stack to be overflowed, due to incomplete checks for this condition. This can result with heap corruption and potentially remote code execution. This problem exists in all versions of Redis with Lua scripting support, starting from 2.6. The problem is fixed in versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. For users unable to update an additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing Lua scripts. This can be done using ACL to restrict EVAL and EVALSHA commands.(CVE-2021-32626)\n\nRedis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In affected versions an integer overflow bug in Redis can be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default proto-max-bulk-len and client-query-buffer-limit configuration parameters to very large values and constructing specially crafted very large stream elements. The problem is fixed in Redis 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. For users unable to upgrade an additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from modifying the proto-max-bulk-len configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.(CVE-2021-32627)\n\nRedis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An integer overflow bug in the ziplist data structure used by all versions of Redis can be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. The vulnerability involves modifying the default ziplist configuration parameters (hash-max-ziplist-entries, hash-max-ziplist-value, zset-max-ziplist-entries or zset-max-ziplist-value) to a very large value, and then constructing specially crafted commands to create very large ziplists. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16, 5.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from modifying the above configuration parameters. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.(CVE-2021-32628)\n\nRedis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. When parsing an incoming Redis Standard Protocol (RESP) request, Redis allocates memory according to user-specified values which determine the number of elements (in the multi-bulk header) and size of each element (in the bulk header). An attacker delivering specially crafted requests over multiple connections can cause the server to allocate significant amount of memory. Because the same parsing mechanism is used to handle authentication requests, this vulnerability can also be exploited by unauthenticated users. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable is to block access to prevent unauthenticated users from connecting to Redis. This can be done in different ways: Using network access control tools like firewalls, iptables, security groups, etc. or Enabling TLS and requiring users to authenticate using client side certificates.(CVE-2021-32675)\n\nRedis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An integer overflow bug affecting all versions of Redis can be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially be used to leak arbitrary contents of the heap or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default set-max-intset-entries configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing specially crafted commands to manipulate sets. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from modifying the set-max-intset-entries configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.(CVE-2021-32687)\n\nRedis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. The redis-cli command line tool and redis-sentinel service may be vulnerable to integer overflow when parsing specially crafted large multi-bulk network replies. This is a result of a vulnerability in the underlying hiredis library which does not perform an overflow check before calling the calloc() heap allocation function. This issue only impacts systems with heap allocators that do not perform their own overflow checks. Most modern systems do and are therefore not likely to be affected. Furthermore, by default redis-sentinel uses the jemalloc allocator which is also not vulnerable. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14.(CVE-2021-32762)\n\nRedis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An integer overflow bug in the underlying string library can be used to corrupt the heap and potentially result with denial of service or remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default proto-max-bulk-len configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing specially crafted network payloads or commands. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from modifying the proto-max-bulk-len configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.(CVE-2021-41099)\n\nRedis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. By exploiting weaknesses in the Lua script execution environment, an attacker with access to Redis prior to version 7.0.0 or 6.2.7 can inject Lua code that will execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another Redis user. The Lua script execution environment in Redis provides some measures that prevent a script from creating side effects that persist and can affect the execution of the same, or different script, at a later time. Several weaknesses of these measures have been publicly known for a long time, but they had no security impact as the Redis security model did not endorse the concept of users or privileges. With the introduction of ACLs in Redis 6.0, these weaknesses can be exploited by a less privileged users to inject Lua code that will execute at a later time, when a privileged user executes a Lua script. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0 and 6.2.7. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is not being used, is to block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL rules.(CVE-2022-24735)\n\nRedis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Prior to versions 6.2.7 and 7.0.0, an attacker attempting to load a specially crafted Lua script can cause NULL pointer dereference which will result with a crash of the redis-server process. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0 and 6.2.7. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is not being used, is to block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL rules.(CVE-2022-24736)\n\nRedis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Authenticated users issuing specially crafted `SETRANGE` and `SORT(_RO)` commands can trigger an integer overflow, resulting with Redis attempting to allocate impossible amounts of memory and abort with an out-of-memory (OOM) panic. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.8, 6.2.9 and 6.0.17. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.(CVE-2022-35977)\n\n** DISPUTED ** A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in Redis up to 6.2.7/7.0.5. Affected is the function sigsegvHandler of the file debug.c of the component Crash Report. The manipulation leads to denial of service. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. Upgrading to version 6.2.8 and 7.0.6 is able to address this issue. The patch is identified as 0bf90d944313919eb8e63d3588bf63a367f020a3. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211962 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE: The vendor claims that this is not a DoS because it applies to the crash logging mechanism which is triggered after a crash has occurred.(CVE-2022-3647)\n\nRedis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Authenticated users issuing specially crafted `SRANDMEMBER`, `ZRANDMEMBER`, and `HRANDFIELD` commands can trigger an integer overflow, resulting in a runtime assertion and termination of the Redis server process. This problem affects all Redis versions. Patches were released in Redis version(s) 6.0.18, 6.2.11 and 7.0.9.(CVE-2023-25155)\n\nRedis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An authenticated user may use a specially crafted Lua script to manipulate the garbage collector and potentially lead to remote code execution. The problem is fixed in 7.4.2, 7.2.7, and 6.2.17. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing Lua scripts. This can be done using ACL to restrict EVAL and EVALSHA commands.(CVE-2024-46981)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"redis","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/redis&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.2.7-1.oe2403sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["redis-7.2.7-1.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","redis-debuginfo-7.2.7-1.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","redis-debugsource-7.2.7-1.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["redis-7.2.7-1.oe2403sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["redis-7.2.7-1.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","redis-debuginfo-7.2.7-1.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","redis-debugsource-7.2.7-1.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1157.json"}},{"package":{"name":"redis","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/redis&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.2.7-1.oe2003sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["redis-7.2.7-1.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","redis-debuginfo-7.2.7-1.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","redis-debugsource-7.2.7-1.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["redis-7.2.7-1.oe2003sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["redis-7.2.7-1.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","redis-debuginfo-7.2.7-1.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","redis-debugsource-7.2.7-1.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1157.json"}},{"package":{"name":"redis","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/redis&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.2.7-1.oe2203sp3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["redis-7.2.7-1.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","redis-debuginfo-7.2.7-1.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","redis-debugsource-7.2.7-1.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["redis-7.2.7-1.oe2203sp3.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["redis-7.2.7-1.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","redis-debuginfo-7.2.7-1.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","redis-debugsource-7.2.7-1.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1157.json"}},{"package":{"name":"redis","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/redis&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.2.7-1.oe2203sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["redis-7.2.7-1.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","redis-debuginfo-7.2.7-1.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","redis-debugsource-7.2.7-1.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["redis-7.2.7-1.oe2203sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["redis-7.2.7-1.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","redis-debuginfo-7.2.7-1.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","redis-debugsource-7.2.7-1.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1157.json"}},{"package":{"name":"redis","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/redis&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.2.7-1.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["redis-7.2.7-1.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","redis-debuginfo-7.2.7-1.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","redis-debugsource-7.2.7-1.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","redis-7.2.7-1.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","redis-debuginfo-7.2.7-1.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","redis-debugsource-7.2.7-1.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["redis-7.2.7-1.oe2403sp1.src.rpm","redis-7.2.7-1.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["redis-7.2.7-1.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","redis-debuginfo-7.2.7-1.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","redis-debugsource-7.2.7-1.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","redis-7.2.7-1.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","redis-debuginfo-7.2.7-1.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","redis-debugsource-7.2.7-1.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1157.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-1157"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32626"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32627"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32628"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32675"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32687"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32762"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41099"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24735"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24736"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35977"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3647"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25155"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-46981"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
