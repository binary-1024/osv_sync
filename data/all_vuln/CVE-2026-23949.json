The vulnerability may allow attackers to extract files outside the intended extraction directory when malicious tar archives are processed. The strip_first_component filter splits the path on the first `/` and extracts the second component, while allowing `../` sequences. Paths like `dummy_dir/../../etc/passwd` become `../../etc/passwd`. Note that this suffers from a nested tarball attack as well with multi-level tar files such as `dummy_dir/inner.tar.gz`, where the inner.tar.gz includes a traversal `dummy_dir/../../config/.env` that also gets translated to `../../config/.env`. Version 6.1.0 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jaraco/jaraco.context","events":[{"introduced":"c23c888c869bfb693246f69ba512aaede5b0438b"},{"fixed":"675aaf5bfb926bdafcded1b0e08ca011d6e0f599"}]}],"versions":["v5.2.0","v5.3.0","v6.0.0","v6.0.1","v6.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23949.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23949.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/jaraco/jaraco.context/blob/main/jaraco/context/__init__.py#L74-L91"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jaraco/jaraco.context/commit/7b26a42b525735e4085d2e994e13802ea339d5f9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/jaraco/jaraco.context/security/advisories/GHSA-58pv-8j8x-9vj2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/main/setuptools/_vendor/jaraco/context.py#L55-L76"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23949"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-22"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23949.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
