  "details": "> [!NOTE]  \n> This advisory was originally emailed to community@solidjs.com by @nsysean.\n\nTo sum it up, the use of javascript's `.replace()` opens up to potential XSS vulnerabilities with the special replacement patterns beginning with `$`.\n\nParticularly, when the attributes of `Meta` tag from solid-meta are user-defined, attackers can utilise the special replacement patterns, either `$'` or `$\\`` to achieve XSS.\n\nThe solid-meta package has this issue since it uses `useAffect` and context providers, which injects the used assets in the html header. \"dom-expressions\" uses `.replace()` to insert the assets, which is vulnerable to the special replacement patterns listed above. \n\nThis effectively means that if the attributes of an asset tag contained user-controlled data, it would be vulnerable to XSS. For instance, there might be meta tags for the open graph protocol in a user profile page, but if attackers set the user query to some payload abusing `.replace()`, then they could execute arbitrary javascript in the victim's web browser. Moreover, it could be stored and cause more problems.",
