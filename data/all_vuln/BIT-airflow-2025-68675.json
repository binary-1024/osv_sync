These fields were not treated as sensitive by default and therefore were not automatically masked in log output. As a result, when such connections are rendered or printed to logs, proxy credentials embedded in these fields could be exposed.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to 3.1.6 or later, which fixes this issue","affected":[{"package":{"name":"airflow","ecosystem":"Bitnami","purl":"pkg:bitnami/airflow"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/bitnami/vulndb/tree/main/data/airflow/BIT-airflow-2025-68675.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2026/01/15/6"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/x6kply4nqd4vc4wgxtm6g9r2tt63s8c5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68675"}],"database_specific":{"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:apache:airflow:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*"],"severity":"High"}}
