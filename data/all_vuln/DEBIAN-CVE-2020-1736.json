This sets the destination files world-readable if the destination file does not exist and if the file exists, the file could be changed to have less restrictive permissions before the move. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data. All versions in 2.7.x, 2.8.x and 2.9.x branches are believed to be vulnerable.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ansible","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ansible?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["10.0.0+dfsg-1","10.0.1+dfsg-1","10.1.0+dfsg-1","10.5.0+dfsg-1","10.5.0+dfsg-2","10.6.0+dfsg-1","11.1.0+dfsg-1","11.2.0+dfsg-1","12.0.0+dfsg-1","12.0.0~a1+dfsg-1","12.0.0~a2+dfsg-1","12.0.0~a4+dfsg-1","12.0.0~a6+dfsg-1","12.0.0~b1+dfsg-1","12.0.0~b2+dfsg-1","12.0.0~b3+dfsg-1","12.0.0~b5+dfsg-1","2.10.7+merged+base+2.10.17+dfsg-0+deb11u1","2.10.7+merged+base+2.10.17+dfsg-0+deb11u2","2.10.7+merged+base+2.10.17+dfsg-0+deb11u3","2.10.7+merged+base+2.10.8+dfsg-1","4.6.0-1","5.4.0-1","5.5.0-1","6.3.0+dfsg-1","6.4.0+dfsg-1","7.0.0+dfsg-1","7.0.0+dfsg-2","7.1.0+dfsg-1","7.2.0+dfsg-2","7.3.0+dfsg-1","7.7.0+dfsg-1","7.7.0+dfsg-2","7.7.0+dfsg-3","9.4.0+dfsg-1","9.5.1+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2020-1736.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ansible","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ansible?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["10.0.0+dfsg-1","10.0.1+dfsg-1","10.1.0+dfsg-1","10.5.0+dfsg-1","10.5.0+dfsg-2","10.6.0+dfsg-1","11.1.0+dfsg-1","11.2.0+dfsg-1","12.0.0+dfsg-1","12.0.0~a1+dfsg-1","12.0.0~a2+dfsg-1","12.0.0~a4+dfsg-1","12.0.0~a6+dfsg-1","12.0.0~b1+dfsg-1","12.0.0~b2+dfsg-1","12.0.0~b3+dfsg-1","12.0.0~b5+dfsg-1","7.3.0+dfsg-1","7.7.0+dfsg-1","7.7.0+dfsg-2","7.7.0+dfsg-3","7.7.0+dfsg-3+deb12u1","9.4.0+dfsg-1","9.5.1+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2020-1736.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ansible","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ansible?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["12.0.0+dfsg-1","12.0.0~a6+dfsg-1","12.0.0~b1+dfsg-1","12.0.0~b2+dfsg-1","12.0.0~b3+dfsg-1","12.0.0~b5+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2020-1736.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ansible","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ansible?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["12.0.0+dfsg-1","12.0.0~a6+dfsg-1","12.0.0~b1+dfsg-1","12.0.0~b2+dfsg-1","12.0.0~b3+dfsg-1","12.0.0~b5+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2020-1736.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1736"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
