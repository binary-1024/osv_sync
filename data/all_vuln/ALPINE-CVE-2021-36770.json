Exploitation requires an unusual configuration, and certain 2021 versions of Encode.pm (3.05 through 3.11). This issue occurs because the || operator evaluates @INC in a scalar context, and thus @INC has only an integer value.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"perl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/perl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.34.0-r1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.0-r0","5.10.0-r1","5.10.1-r0","5.10.1-r1","5.10.1-r2","5.12.1-r0","5.12.2-r0","5.12.2-r1","5.12.3-r0","5.14.0-r0","5.14.1-r0","5.14.2-r0","5.14.2-r1","5.16.0-r0","5.16.1-r0","5.16.2-r0","5.16.3-r0","5.18.0-r0","5.18.1-r0","5.18.2-r0","5.20.0-r0","5.20.1-r0","5.20.2-r0","5.20.2-r1","5.22.0-r0","5.22.1-r0","5.22.2-r0","5.24.0-r0","5.24.0-r1","5.24.0-r2","5.24.1-r0","5.24.1-r1","5.24.1-r2","5.26.0-r0","5.26.1-r0","5.26.1-r1","5.26.2-r0","5.26.2-r1","5.26.3-r0","5.28.1-r0","5.28.2-r0","5.28.2-r1","5.30.0-r0","5.30.0-r1","5.30.0-r2","5.30.1-r0","5.30.2-r0","5.30.3-r0","5.30.3-r1","5.30.3-r2","5.32.0-r0","5.32.1-r0","5.34.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-36770.json"}},{"package":{"name":"perl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/perl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.34.0-r1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.0-r0","5.10.0-r1","5.10.1-r0","5.10.1-r1","5.10.1-r2","5.12.1-r0","5.12.2-r0","5.12.2-r1","5.12.3-r0","5.14.0-r0","5.14.1-r0","5.14.2-r0","5.14.2-r1","5.16.0-r0","5.16.1-r0","5.16.2-r0","5.16.3-r0","5.18.0-r0","5.18.1-r0","5.18.2-r0","5.20.0-r0","5.20.1-r0","5.20.2-r0","5.20.2-r1","5.22.0-r0","5.22.1-r0","5.22.2-r0","5.24.0-r0","5.24.0-r1","5.24.0-r2","5.24.1-r0","5.24.1-r1","5.24.1-r2","5.26.0-r0","5.26.1-r0","5.26.1-r1","5.26.2-r0","5.26.2-r1","5.26.3-r0","5.28.1-r0","5.28.2-r0","5.28.2-r1","5.30.0-r0","5.30.0-r1","5.30.0-r2","5.30.1-r0","5.30.2-r0","5.30.3-r0","5.30.3-r1","5.30.3-r2","5.32.0-r0","5.32.1-r0","5.34.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-36770.json"}},{"package":{"name":"perl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/perl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.34.0-r1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.0-r0","5.10.0-r1","5.10.1-r0","5.10.1-r1","5.10.1-r2","5.12.1-r0","5.12.2-r0","5.12.2-r1","5.12.3-r0","5.14.0-r0","5.14.1-r0","5.14.2-r0","5.14.2-r1","5.16.0-r0","5.16.1-r0","5.16.2-r0","5.16.3-r0","5.18.0-r0","5.18.1-r0","5.18.2-r0","5.20.0-r0","5.20.1-r0","5.20.2-r0","5.20.2-r1","5.22.0-r0","5.22.1-r0","5.22.2-r0","5.24.0-r0","5.24.0-r1","5.24.0-r2","5.24.1-r0","5.24.1-r1","5.24.1-r2","5.26.0-r0","5.26.1-r0","5.26.1-r1","5.26.2-r0","5.26.2-r1","5.26.3-r0","5.28.1-r0","5.28.2-r0","5.28.2-r1","5.30.0-r0","5.30.0-r1","5.30.0-r2","5.30.1-r0","5.30.2-r0","5.30.3-r0","5.30.3-r1","5.30.3-r2","5.32.0-r0","5.32.1-r0","5.34.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-36770.json"}},{"package":{"name":"perl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/perl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.34.0-r1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.0-r0","5.10.0-r1","5.10.1-r0","5.10.1-r1","5.10.1-r2","5.12.1-r0","5.12.2-r0","5.12.2-r1","5.12.3-r0","5.14.0-r0","5.14.1-r0","5.14.2-r0","5.14.2-r1","5.16.0-r0","5.16.1-r0","5.16.2-r0","5.16.3-r0","5.18.0-r0","5.18.1-r0","5.18.2-r0","5.20.0-r0","5.20.1-r0","5.20.2-r0","5.20.2-r1","5.22.0-r0","5.22.1-r0","5.22.2-r0","5.24.0-r0","5.24.0-r1","5.24.0-r2","5.24.1-r0","5.24.1-r1","5.24.1-r2","5.26.0-r0","5.26.1-r0","5.26.1-r1","5.26.2-r0","5.26.2-r1","5.26.3-r0","5.28.1-r0","5.28.2-r0","5.28.2-r1","5.30.0-r0","5.30.0-r1","5.30.0-r2","5.30.1-r0","5.30.2-r0","5.30.3-r0","5.30.3-r1","5.30.3-r2","5.32.0-r0","5.32.1-r0","5.34.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-36770.json"}},{"package":{"name":"perl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/perl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.34.0-r1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.0-r0","5.10.0-r1","5.10.1-r0","5.10.1-r1","5.10.1-r2","5.12.1-r0","5.12.2-r0","5.12.2-r1","5.12.3-r0","5.14.0-r0","5.14.1-r0","5.14.2-r0","5.14.2-r1","5.16.0-r0","5.16.1-r0","5.16.2-r0","5.16.3-r0","5.18.0-r0","5.18.1-r0","5.18.2-r0","5.20.0-r0","5.20.1-r0","5.20.2-r0","5.20.2-r1","5.22.0-r0","5.22.1-r0","5.22.2-r0","5.24.0-r0","5.24.0-r1","5.24.0-r2","5.24.1-r0","5.24.1-r1","5.24.1-r2","5.26.0-r0","5.26.1-r0","5.26.1-r1","5.26.2-r0","5.26.2-r1","5.26.3-r0","5.28.1-r0","5.28.2-r0","5.28.2-r1","5.30.0-r0","5.30.0-r1","5.30.0-r2","5.30.1-r0","5.30.2-r0","5.30.3-r0","5.30.3-r1","5.30.3-r2","5.32.0-r0","5.32.1-r0","5.34.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-36770.json"}},{"package":{"name":"perl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/perl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.34.0-r1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.0-r0","5.10.0-r1","5.10.1-r0","5.10.1-r1","5.10.1-r2"
