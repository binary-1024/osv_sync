As a result, this lead to soft lockup in the OOM process.  To fix this issue, call 'cond_resched' in the 'mem_cgroup_scan_tasks' function per 1000 iterations.  For global OOM, call 'touch_softlockup_watchdog' per 1000 iterations to avoid this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.237-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.103-1","5.10.103-1~bpo10+1","5.10.106-1","5.10.113-1","5.10.120-1","5.10.120-1~bpo10+1","5.10.127-1","5.10.127-2","5.10.127-2~bpo10+1","5.10.136-1","5.10.140-1","5.10.148-1","5.10.149-1","5.10.149-2","5.10.158-1","5.10.158-2","5.10.162-1","5.10.178-1","5.10.178-2","5.10.178-3","5.10.179-1","5.10.179-2","5.10.179-3","5.10.179-4","5.10.179-5","5.10.191-1","5.10.197-1","5.10.205-1","5.10.205-2","5.10.209-1","5.10.209-2","5.10.216-1","5.10.218-1","5.10.221-1","5.10.223-1","5.10.226-1","5.10.234-1","5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1","5.10.92-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-57977.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.133-1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.106-1","6.1.106-2","6.1.106-3","6.1.112-1","6.1.115-1","6.1.119-1","6.1.123-1","6.1.124-1","6.1.128-1","6.1.129-1","6.1.27-1","6.1.37-1","6.1.38-1","6.1.38-2","6.1.38-2~bpo11+1","6.1.38-3","6.1.38-4","6.1.38-4~bpo11+1","6.1.52-1","6.1.55-1","6.1.55-1~bpo11+1","6.1.64-1","6.1.66-1","6.1.67-1","6.1.69-1","6.1.69-1~bpo11+1","6.1.76-1","6.1.76-1~bpo11+1","6.1.82-1","6.1.85-1","6.1.90-1","6.1.90-1~bpo11+1","6.1.94-1","6.1.94-1~bpo11+1","6.1.98-1","6.1.99-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-57977.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.13-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-57977.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.13-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-57977.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux-6.1","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-6.1?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.137-1~deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.106-3~deb11u1","6.1.106-3~deb11u2","6.1.106-3~deb11u3","6.1.112-1~deb11u1","6.1.119-1~deb11u1","6.1.128-1~deb11u1","6.1.129-1~deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-57977.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-57977"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
