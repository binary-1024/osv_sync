  "details": "It was discovered that there was an overflow issue in runc, the runtime\nfor the Open Container Project, often used with Docker. The Netlink\n'bytemsg' length field could have allowed an attacker to override\nNetlink-based container configurations. This vulnerability required the\nattacker to have some control over the configuration of the container, but\nwould have allowed the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of\nthe container by simply adding their own Netlink payload which disables\nall namespaces. (CVE-2021-43784)\n",
