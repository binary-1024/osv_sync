If ld->buffer_size - words*4 is negative, a buffer overflow is later performed via getdword_n(&ld->start[words], ld->bytes_left).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"faad2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/faad2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.7-r0","2.7-r1","2.7-r2","2.7-r3","2.7-r4","2.7-r5","2.7-r6","2.7-r7","2.7-r8","2.8.8-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-15296.json"}},{"package":{"name":"faad2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/faad2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.7-r0","2.7-r1","2.7-r2","2.7-r3","2.7-r4","2.7-r5","2.7-r6","2.7-r7","2.7-r8","2.8.8-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-15296.json"}},{"package":{"name":"faad2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.7","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/faad2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.7-r0","2.7-r1","2.7-r2","2.7-r3","2.7-r4","2.7-r5","2.7-r6","2.7-r7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-15296.json"}},{"package":{"name":"faad2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.8","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/faad2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.7-r0","2.7-r1","2.7-r2","2.7-r3","2.7-r4","2.7-r5","2.7-r6","2.7-r7","2.7-r8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-15296.json"}},{"package":{"name":"faad2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.9","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/faad2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.7-r0","2.7-r1","2.7-r2","2.7-r3","2.7-r4","2.7-r5","2.7-r6","2.7-r7","2.7-r8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-15296.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2019-15296"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
