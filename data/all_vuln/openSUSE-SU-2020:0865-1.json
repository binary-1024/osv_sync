This unfortunately affects changes introduced\n  in v2.11 to increase logging at default log level.\n\nSecurity fixes:\n\n- CVE-2020-14149: When entering an invalid directory with the FTP\n  command CWD, a NULL ptr was deref. in a DBG() message even\n  though the log level is set to a value lower than LOG_DEBUG.\n  This caused uftpd to crash and cause denial of service.\n  Depending on the init/inetd system used this could be\n  permanent.
