{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-42241","published":"2024-08-07T16:15:46Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:19:25.898821Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-42241"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/shmem: disable PMD-sized page cache if needed  For shmem files, it's possible that PMD-sized page cache can't be supported by xarray.  For example, 512MB page cache on ARM64 when the base page size is 64KB can't be supported by xarray.  It leads to errors as the following messages indicate when this sort of xarray entry is split.

As Matthew Wilcox pointed, the page cache in a shmem file isn't represented by a multi-index entry and doesn't have this limitation when the xarry entry is split until commit 6b24ca4a1a8d (\"mm: Use multi-index entries in the page cache\").","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.1.106-1","6.1.106-2","6.1.106-3","6.1.112-1","6.1.115-1","6.1.119-1","6.1.123-1","6.1.124-1","6.1.128-1","6.1.129-1","6.1.133-1","6.1.135-1","6.1.137-1","6.1.139-1","6.1.140-1","6.1.147-1","6.1.148-1","6.1.153-1","6.1.27-1","6.1.37-1","6.1.38-1","6.1.38-2","6.1.38-2~bpo11+1","6.1.38-3","6.1.38-4","6.1.38-4~bpo11+1","6.1.52-1","6.1.55-1","6.1.55-1~bpo11+1","6.1.64-1","6.1.66-1","6.1.67-1","6.1.69-1","6.1.69-1~bpo11+1","6.1.76-1","6.1.76-1~bpo11+1","6.1.82-1","6.1.85-1","6.1.90-1","6.1.90-1~bpo11+1","6.1.94-1","6.1.94-1~bpo11+1","6.1.98-1","6.1.99-1","6.10-1~exp1","6.10.1-1~exp1","6.10.11-1","6.10.11-1~bpo12+1","6.10.12-1","6.10.3-1","6.10.4-1","6.10.6-1","6.10.6-1~bpo12+1","6.10.7-1","6.10.9-1","6.11-1~exp1","6.11.10-1","6.11.10-1~bpo12+1","6.11.2-1","6.11.4-1","6.11.5-1","6.11.5-1~bpo12+1","6.11.6-1","6.11.7-1","6.11.9-1","6.11~rc4-1~exp1","6.11~rc5-1~exp1","6.12.10-1","6.12.11-1","6.12.11-1+alpha","6.12.11-1+alpha.1","6.12.12-1","6.12.12-1~bpo12+1","6.12.13-1","6.12.15-1","6.12.16-1","6.12.17-1","6.12.19-1","6.12.20-1","6.12.21-1","6.12.22-1","6.12.22-1~bpo12+1","6.12.25-1","6.12.27-1","6.12.27-1~bpo12+1","6.12.29-1","6.12.3-1","6.12.30-1","6.12.30-1~bpo12+1","6.12.31-1","6.12.32-1","6.12.32-1~bpo12+1","6.12.33-1","6.12.33-1~bpo12+1","6.12.35-1","6.12.35-1~bpo12+1","6.12.37-1","6.12.38-1","6.12.38-1~bpo12+1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.5-1","6.12.6-1","6.12.8-1","6.12.9-1","6.12.9-1+alpha","6.12.9-1~bpo12+1","6.12~rc6-1~exp1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.3-1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16.5-1","6.16.6-1","6.16.7-1","6.16.8-1","6.16.9-1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1","6.3.1-1~exp1","6.3.11-1","6.3.2-1~exp1","6.3.4-1~exp1","6.3.5-1~exp1","6.3.7-1","6.3.7-1~bpo12+1","6.4.1-1~exp1","6.4.11-1","6.4.13-1","6.4.4-1","6.4.4-1~bpo12+1","6.4.4-2","6.4.4-3","6.4.4-3~bpo12+1","6.4~rc6-1~exp1","6.4~rc7-1~exp1","6.5.1-1~exp1","6.5.10-1","6.5.10-1~bpo12+1","6.5.13-1","6.5.3-1","6.5.3-1~bpo12+1","6.5.6-1","6.5.8-1","6.5~rc4-1~exp1","6.5~rc6-1~exp1","6.5~rc7-1~exp1","6.6.11-1","6.6.13-1","6.6.13-1~bpo12+1","6.6.15-1","6.6.15-2","6.6.3-1~exp1","6.6.4-1~exp1","6.6.7-1~exp1","6.6.8-1","6.6.9-1","6.7-1~exp1","6.7.1-1~exp1","6.7.12-1","6.7.12-1~bpo12+1","6.7.4-1~exp1","6.7.7-1","6.7.9-1","6.7.9-2","6.8.11-1","6.8.12-1","6.8.12-1~bpo12+1","6.8.9-1","6.9.10-1","6.9.10-1~bpo12+1","6.9.11-1","6.9.12-1","6.9.2-1~exp1","6.9.7-1","6.9.7-1~bpo12+1","6.9.8-1","6.9.9-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-42241.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.9.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-42241.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.9.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-42241.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-42241"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
