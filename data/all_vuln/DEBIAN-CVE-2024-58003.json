  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: i2c: ds90ub9x3: Fix extra fwnode_handle_put()  The ub913 and ub953 drivers call fwnode_handle_put(priv->sd.fwnode) as part of their remove process, and if the driver is removed multiple times, eventually leads to put \"overflow\", possibly causing memory corruption or crash.  The fwnode_handle_put() is a leftover from commit 905f88ccebb1 (\"media: i2c: ds90ub9x3: Fix sub-device matching\"), which changed the code related to the sd.fwnode, but missed removing these fwnode_handle_put() calls.",
