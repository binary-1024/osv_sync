In versions up to and including 0.19.1, the `makerjs.extendObject` function copies properties from source objects without proper validation, potentially exposing applications to security risks. The function lacks `hasOwnProperty()` checks and does not filter dangerous keys, allowing inherited properties and potentially malicious properties to be copied to target objects. A patch is available in commit 85e0f12bd868974b891601a141974f929dec36b8, which is expected to be part of version 0.19.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/microsoft/maker.js","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"85e0f12bd868974b891601a141974f929dec36b8"}]}],"versions":["0.1.3","0.2.1","0.5.3","0.6","0.6.11","0.7.0","0.7.1","0.9.10","0.9.17"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24888.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24888.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/maker.js/blob/98cffa82a372ff942194c925a12a311253587167/packages/maker.js/src/core/maker.ts#L232-L241"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/maker.js/commit/85e0f12bd868974b891601a141974f929dec36b8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/maker.js/security/advisories/GHSA-2cp6-34r9-54xx"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24888"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-1321"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24888.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
