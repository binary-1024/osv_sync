Versions 3.2.0 through 3.20.109, 3.21.0-a.0 through 3.21.44 and 3.22.0-a.0 through 3.22.28 have a n Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability that allows unauthenticated actors to extract sensitive information in plain text. Orders created before Saleor 3.2.0 could have PIIs exfiltrated. The issue has been patched in Saleor versions: 3.22.29, 3.21.45, and 3.20.110. To workaround, temporarily block non-staff users from fetching order information (the order() GraphQL query) using a WAF.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/saleor/saleor","events":[{"introduced":"26daff2a2df37d25a8cdfa2d7b0a98afc2d2cace"},{"fixed":"aeaced8acb5e01055eddec584263f77e517d5944"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.22.0-a.0"},{"fixed":"3.22.29"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/saleor/saleor","events":[{"introduced":"8991fcba23bc88f371f6409530d0645c389cc5de"},{"fixed":"9bcd4f9000b189297eeb3ac88cc28c6c30229153"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.21.0-a.0"},{"fixed":"3.21.45"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/saleor/saleor","events":[{"introduced":"5763cb1ad22b84e29a270b9b0b365f32074b753d"},{"fixed":"5dab1857fbb2801f74e2bfe86f307e4590d9d2fa"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.2.0"},{"fixed":"3.20.110"}]}}],"versions":["3.11.0-a.0","3.12.0-a.0","3.13.0-a.0","3.14.67","3.15.0-a.0","3.15.41","3.16.0-a.0","3.16.42","3.17.0-a.0","3.18.0-a.0","3.19.0-a.0","3.2.0","3.20.0","3.20.0-a.0","3.20.0-a.1","3.20.1","3.20.10","3.20.100","3.20.101","3.20.102","3.20.103","3.20.104","3.20.105","3.20.106","3.20.107","3.20.108","3.20.109","3.20.11","3.20.12","3.20.13","3.20.14","3.20.15","3.20.16","3.20.17","3.20.18","3.20.19","3.20.2","3.20.20","3.20.21","3.20.22","3.20.23","3.20.24","3.20.25","3.20.26","3.20.27","3.20.28","3.20.29","3.20.3","3.20.30","3.20.31","3.20.32","3.20.33","3.20.34","3.20.35","3.20.36","3.20.37","3.20.38","3.20.39","3.20.4","3.20.40","3.20.41","3.20.42","3.20.43","3.20.44","3.20.45","3.20.46","3.20.47","3.20.48","3.20.49","3.20.5","3.20.50","3.20.51","3.20.52","3.20.53","3.20.54","3.20.55","3.20.56","3.20.57","3.20.58","3.20.59","3.20.6","3.20.60","3.20.61","3.20.62","3.20.63","3.20.64","3.20.65","3.20.66","3.20.67","3.20.68","3.20.69","3.20.7","3.20.70","3.20.71","3.20.72","3.20.73","3.20.74","3.20.75","3.20.76","3.20.77","3.20.78","3.20.79","3.20.8","3.20.80","3.20.81","3.20.82","3.20.83","3.20.84","3.20.85","3.20.86","3.20.87","3.20.88","3.20.89","3.20.9","3.20.90","3.20.91","3.20.92","3.20.93","3.20.94","3.20.95","3.20.96","3.20.97","3.20.98","3.20.99","3.21.0","3.21.0-a.0","3.21.0-a.4","3.21.0-a.5","3.21.0-a.6","3.21.1","3.21.10","3.21.11","3.21.12","3.21.13","3.21.14","3.21.15","3.21.16","3.21.17","3.21.18","3.21.19","3.21.2","3.21.20","3.21.21","3.21.22","3.21.23","3.21.24","3.21.25","3.21.26","3.21.27","3.21.28","3.21.29","3.21.3","3.21.30","3.21.31","3.21.32","3.21.33","3.21.34","3.21.35","3.21.36","3.21.37","3.21.38","3.21.39","3.21.4","3.21.40","3.21.41","3.21.42","3.21.43","3.21.44","3.21.5","3.21.6","3.21.7","3.21.8","3.21.9","3.22.0","3.22.0-a.0","3.22.0-a.3","3.22.0-a.4","3.22.1","3.22.10","3.22.11","3.22.12","3.22.13","3.22.14","3.22.15","3.22.16","3.22.17","3.22.18","3.22.19","3.22.2","3.22.20","3.22.21","3.22.22","3.22.23","3.22.24","3.22.25","3.22.26","3.22.27","3.22.28","3.22.3","3.22.4","3.22.5","3.22.6","3.22.7","3.22.8","3.22.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24136.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24136.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/saleor/saleor/commit/5dab1857fbb2801f74e2bfe86f307e4590d9d2fa"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/saleor/saleor/commit/718ce1b4fc3aef68eeac1aea0cf1d70a614ba6af"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/saleor/saleor/commit/9bcd4f9000b189297eeb3ac88cc28c6c30229153"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/saleor/saleor/commit/aeaced8acb5e01055eddec584263f77e517d5944"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/saleor/saleor/security/advisories/GHSA-r6fj-f4r9-36gr"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24136"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-639"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24136.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
