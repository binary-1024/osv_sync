{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22258","published":"2026-01-27T17:16:12.253Z","modified":"2026-01-28T10:18:48.289696Z","upstream":["CVE-2026-22258"],"details":"Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine. Prior to versions 8.0.3 and 7.0.14, crafted DCERPC traffic can cause Suricata to expand a buffer w/o limits, leading to memory exhaustion and the process getting killed. While reported for DCERPC over UDP, it is believed that DCERPC over TCP and SMB are also vulnerable. DCERPC/TCP in the default configuration should not be vulnerable as the default stream depth is limited to 1MiB. Versions 8.0.3 and 7.0.14 contain a patch. Some workarounds are available. For DCERPC/UDP, disable the parser. For DCERPC/TCP, the `stream.reassembly.depth` setting will limit the amount of data that can be buffered. For DCERPC/SMB, the `stream.reassembly.depth` can be used as well, but is set to unlimited by default. Imposing a limit here may lead to loss of visibility in SMB.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"suricata","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/suricata?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:6.0.1-3","1:6.0.1-3+deb11u1","1:6.0.10-1","1:6.0.10-1~bpo11+1","1:6.0.13-1","1:6.0.2-1~exp1","1:6.0.3-1","1:6.0.3-1~exp1","1:6.0.3-1~exp2","1:6.0.3-2","1:6.0.3-2~bpo11+1","1:6.0.4-1","1:6.0.4-2","1:6.0.4-2~bpo10+1","1:6.0.4-2~bpo11+1","1:6.0.4-3","1:6.0.5-1","1:6.0.5-2","1:6.0.5-2~bpo10+1","1:6.0.5-2~bpo11+1","1:6.0.5-3","1:6.0.6-1","1:6.0.6-1~bpo10+1","1:6.0.6-1~bpo11+1","1:6.0.6-2","1:6.0.8-1","1:6.0.8-1~bpo11+1","1:6.0.9-1","1:6.0.9-1~bpo11+1","1:7.0.0-1","1:7.0.0-2","1:7.0.0-2~bpo12+1","1:7.0.1-1","1:7.0.10-1","1:7.0.10-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.11-1","1:7.0.11-1~bpo13+1","1:7.0.2-1","1:7.0.2-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.2-2","1:7.0.2-2~exp1","1:7.0.2-2~exp2","1:7.0.3-1","1:7.0.3-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.4-1","1:7.0.5-1","1:7.0.5-2~bpo12+1","1:7.0.6-1","1:7.0.6-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.6-2~exp1","1:7.0.7-1","1:7.0.7-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.8-1","1:7.0.8-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.8-2","1:7.0.9-1","1:8.0.0-1~exp1","1:8.0.0-1~exp2","1:8.0.0-1~exp4","1:8.0.0-1~exp5","1:8.0.1-1","1:8.0.1-2","1:8.0.1-3","1:8.0.1-3~bpo13+1","1:8.0.2-1","1:8.0.2-1~bpo13+1","1:8.0.3-1","1:8.0.3-1~bpo13+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22258.json"}},{"package":{"name":"suricata","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/suricata?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:6.0.10-1","1:6.0.13-1","1:7.0.0-1","1:7.0.0-2","1:7.0.0-2~bpo12+1","1:7.0.1-1","1:7.0.10-1","1:7.0.10-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.11-1","1:7.0.11-1~bpo13+1","1:7.0.2-1","1:7.0.2-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.2-2","1:7.0.2-2~exp1","1:7.0.2-2~exp2","1:7.0.3-1","1:7.0.3-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.4-1","1:7.0.5-1","1:7.0.5-2~bpo12+1","1:7.0.6-1","1:7.0.6-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.6-2~exp1","1:7.0.7-1","1:7.0.7-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.8-1","1:7.0.8-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.8-2","1:7.0.9-1","1:8.0.0-1~exp1","1:8.0.0-1~exp2","1:8.0.0-1~exp4","1:8.0.0-1~exp5","1:8.0.1-1","1:8.0.1-2","1:8.0.1-3","1:8.0.1-3~bpo13+1","1:8.0.2-1","1:8.0.2-1~bpo13+1","1:8.0.3-1","1:8.0.3-1~bpo13+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22258.json"}},{"package":{"name":"suricata","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/suricata?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:7.0.10-1","1:7.0.10-1+deb13u1","1:7.0.10-1+deb13u2","1:7.0.11-1","1:7.0.11-1~bpo13+1","1:8.0.0-1~exp1","1:8.0.0-1~exp2","1:8.0.0-1~exp4","1:8.0.0-1~exp5","1:8.0.1-1","1:8.0.1-2","1:8.0.1-3","1:8.0.1-3~bpo13+1","1:8.0.2-1","1:8.0.2-1~bpo13+1","1:8.0.3-1","1:8.0.3-1~bpo13+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22258.json"}},{"package":{"name":"suricata","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/suricata?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:8.0.3-1"}]}],"versions":["1:7.0.10-1","1:7.0.11-1","1:7.0.11-1~bpo13+1","1:8.0.0-1~exp1","1:8.0.0-1~exp2","1:8.0.0-1~exp4","1:8.0.0-1~exp5","1:8.0.1-1","1:8.0.1-2","1:8.0.1-3","1:8.0.1-3~bpo13+1","1:8.0.2-1","1:8.0.2-1~bpo13+1","1:8.0.3-1~bpo13+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22258.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2026-22258"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
