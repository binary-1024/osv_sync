In versions up to and including 2.11.1 when in a dialog set (or forking) scenario, a hash key shared by multiple UAC dialogs can potentially be prematurely freed when one of the dialogs is destroyed . The issue may cause a dialog set to be registered in the hash table multiple times (with different hash keys) leading to undefined behavior such as dialog list collision which eventually leading to endless loop. A patch is available in commit db3235953baa56d2fb0e276ca510fefca751643f which will be included in the next release. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"asterisk","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/asterisk?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["1:16.16.1~dfsg+~2.10-1","1:16.16.1~dfsg+~2.10-2","1:16.16.1~dfsg-1","1:16.16.1~dfsg-1+deb11u1","1:16.16.1~dfsg-1+deb11u1~bpo10+1","1:16.16.1~dfsg-2","1:16.16.1~dfsg-3","1:16.16.1~dfsg-4","1:16.23.0~dfsg+~2.10-1","1:16.23.0~dfsg+~cs6.10.20220309-1","1:16.23.0~dfsg+~cs6.10.20220309-2","1:16.23.0~dfsg+~cs6.10.40431411-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-23608.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ring","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ring?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"20210112.2.b757bac~ds1-1+deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["20210112.2.b757bac~ds1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-23608.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ring","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ring?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"20230206.0~ds1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-23608.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23608"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
