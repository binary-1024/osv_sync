This package includes the components to operate a DNS server.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nCertain DNSSEC aspects of the DNS protocol (in RFC 4033, 4034, 4035, 6840, and related RFCs) allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via one or more DNSSEC responses, aka the &quot;KeyTrap&quot; issue. One of the concerns is that, when there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the protocol specification implies that an algorithm must evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG records.(CVE-2023-50387)\n\nThe Closest Encloser Proof aspect of the DNS protocol (in RFC 5155 when RFC 9276 guidance is skipped) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption for SHA-1 computations) via DNSSEC responses in a random subdomain attack, aka the &quot;NSEC3&quot; issue. The RFC 5155 specification implies that an algorithm must perform thousands of iterations of a hash function in certain situations.(CVE-2023-50868)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"bind","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/bind&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["bind-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","bind-chroot-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","bind-debuginfo-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","bind-debugsource-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","bind-devel-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","bind-export-devel-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","bind-export-libs-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","bind-libs-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","bind-libs-lite-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-devel-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","bind-utils-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["python3-bind-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.noarch.rpm"],"src":["bind-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["bind-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","bind-chroot-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","bind-debuginfo-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","bind-debugsource-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","bind-devel-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","bind-export-devel-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","bind-export-libs-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","bind-libs-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","bind-libs-lite-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-devel-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","bind-utils-9.11.21-21.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2609.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2609"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-50387"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-50868"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
