  "details": "A flaw was found in the libreswan client plugin for NetworkManager\n(NetkworkManager-libreswan), where it fails to properly sanitize the VPN\nconfiguration from the local unprivileged user. In this configuration,\ncomposed by a key-value format, the plugin fails to escape special\ncharacters, leading the application to interpret values as keys. One of\nthe most critical parameters that could be abused by a malicious user is\nthe \"leftupdown\" key. This key takes an executable command as a value and\nis used to specify what executes as a callback in\nNetworkManager-libreswan to retrieve configuration settings back to\nNetworkManager. As NetworkManager uses Polkit to allow an unprivileged\nuser to control the system's network configuration, a malicious actor\ncould achieve local privilege escalation and potential code execution as\nroot in the targeted machine by creating a malicious configuration.\n(CVE-2024-9050)\n",
