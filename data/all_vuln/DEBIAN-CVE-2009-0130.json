NOTE: a package maintainer disputes this issue, reporting that there is a proper check within the only code that uses the applicable part of crypto_drv.c, and thus \"this report is invalid.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"erlang","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/erlang?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:23.2.6+dfsg-1","1:23.2.6+dfsg-1+deb11u1","1:23.2.6+dfsg-1+deb11u2","1:24.0.2+dfsg-1","1:24.0.3+dfsg-1","1:24.0.4+dfsg-1","1:24.0.5+dfsg-1","1:24.0.5+dfsg-2","1:24.0.6+dfsg-1","1:24.0.6+dfsg-2","1:24.0~rc1+dfsg-1","1:24.0~rc2+dfsg-1","1:24.0~rc3+dfsg-1","1:24.1+dfsg-1","1:24.1.1+dfsg-1","1:24.1.4+dfsg-1","1:24.1.5+dfsg-1","1:24.1.7+dfsg-1","1:24.2+dfsg-1","1:24.2.1+dfsg-1","1:24.2.2+dfsg-1","1:24.3+dfsg-1","1:24.3.1+dfsg-1","1:24.3.2+dfsg-1","1:24.3.3+dfsg-1","1:24.3.4+dfsg-1","1:24.3.4.1+dfsg-1","1:24.3.4.5+dfsg-1","1:25.0+dfsg-1","1:25.0.2+dfsg-1","1:25.0.3+dfsg-1","1:25.0.4+dfsg-1","1:25.0~rc1+dfsg-1","1:25.0~rc2+dfsg-1","1:25.0~rc3+dfsg-1","1:25.1.1+dfsg-1","1:25.1.2+dfsg-1","1:25.2+dfsg-1","1:25.2.1+dfsg-1","1:25.2.1+dfsg-2","1:25.2.2+dfsg-1","1:25.2.3+dfsg-1","1:25.3.2.10+dfsg-1","1:25.3.2.10+dfsg-2","1:25.3.2.11+dfsg-1","1:25.3.2.12+dfsg-1","1:25.3.2.12+dfsg-2","1:25.3.2.12+dfsg-3","1:25.3.2.8+dfsg-1","1:26.0+dfsg-1","1:26.0.1+dfsg-1","1:26.0.2+dfsg-1","1:26.0~rc2+dfsg-1","1:26.0~rc3+dfsg-1","1:26.1.2+dfsg-1","1:26.2.1+dfsg-1","1:26.2.4+dfsg-1","1:27.0+dfsg-1","1:27.0.1+dfsg-1","1:27.0.1+dfsg-2","1:27.0.1+dfsg-3","1:27.0~rc3+dfsg-1","1:27.0~rc3+dfsg-2","1:27.0~rc3+dfsg-3","1:27.0~rc3+dfsg-4","1:27.1.2+dfsg-1","1:27.2+dfsg-1","1:27.2+dfsg-2","1:27.2+dfsg-3~exp1","1:27.2.1+dfsg-1","1:27.2.1+dfsg-2","1:27.2.2+dfsg-1","1:27.2.3+dfsg-1","1:27.2.4+dfsg-1","1:27.3+dfsg-1","1:27.3.1+dfsg-1","1:27.3.2+dfsg-1","1:27.3.3+dfsg-1","1:27.3.4+dfsg-1","1:27.3.4.1+dfsg-1","1:27.3.4.3+dfsg-1","1:28.0+dfsg-1","1:28.0.1+dfsg-1","1:28.0.2+dfsg-1","1:28.0.4+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2009-0130.json"}},{"package":{"name":"erlang","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/erlang?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:25.2.3+dfsg-1","1:25.2.3+dfsg-1+deb12u1","1:25.2.3+dfsg-1+deb12u2","1:25.2.3+dfsg-1+deb12u3","1:25.3.2.10+dfsg-1","1:25.3.2.10+dfsg-2","1:25.3.2.11+dfsg-1","1:25.3.2.12+dfsg-1","1:25.3.2.12+dfsg-2","1:25.3.2.12+dfsg-3","1:25.3.2.8+dfsg-1","1:26.0+dfsg-1","1:26.0.1+dfsg-1","1:26.0.2+dfsg-1","1:26.0~rc2+dfsg-1","1:26.0~rc3+dfsg-1","1:26.1.2+dfsg-1","1:26.2.1+dfsg-1","1:26.2.4+dfsg-1","1:27.0+dfsg-1","1:27.0.1+dfsg-1","1:27.0.1+dfsg-2","1:27.0.1+dfsg-3","1:27.0~rc3+dfsg-1","1:27.0~rc3+dfsg-2","1:27.0~rc3+dfsg-3","1:27.0~rc3+dfsg-4","1:27.1.2+dfsg-1","1:27.2+dfsg-1","1:27.2+dfsg-2","1:27.2+dfsg-3~exp1","1:27.2.1+dfsg-1","1:27.2.1+dfsg-2","1:27.2.2+dfsg-1","1:27.2.3+dfsg-1","1:27.2.4+dfsg-1","1:27.3+dfsg-1","1:27.3.1+dfsg-1","1:27.3.2+dfsg-1","1:27.3.3+dfsg-1","1:27.3.4+dfsg-1","1:27.3.4.1+dfsg-1","1:27.3.4.3+dfsg-1","1:28.0+dfsg-1","1:28.0.1+dfsg-1","1:28.0.2+dfsg-1","1:28.0.4+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2009-0130.json"}},{"package":{"name":"erlang","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/erlang?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:27.3.4.1+dfsg-1","1:27.3.4.3+dfsg-1","1:28.0+dfsg-1","1:28.0.1+dfsg-1","1:28.0.2+dfsg-1","1:28.0.4+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2009-0130.json"}},{"package":{"name":"erlang","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/erlang?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:27.3.4.1+dfsg-1","1:27.3.4.3+dfsg-1","1:28.0+dfsg-1","1:28.0.1+dfsg-1","1:28.0.2+dfsg-1","1:28.0.4+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2009-0130.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0130"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
