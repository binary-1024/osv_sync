This update fixes the\nproblem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that mpg123 incorrectly handled certain mp3 files. If a\n user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted mp3\n file, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause mpg123 to crash,\n resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n",
