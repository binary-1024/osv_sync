{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-23516","published":"2026-01-21T21:38:32.971Z","modified":"2026-01-28T05:51:56.331553Z","aliases":["GHSA-3m7p-wx65-c7mp"],"summary":"CVAT vulnerable to XSS via skeleton SVG images","details":"CVAT is an open source interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision. In versions 2.2.0 through 2.54.0, an attacker is able to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim user's CVAT UI session, provided that they are able to create a maliciously crafted label in a CVAT task or project, then get the victim user to either edit that label, or view a shape that refers to that label; and/or get the victim user to upload a maliciously crafted SVG image when configuring a skeleton. This gives the attacker temporary access to all CVAT resources that the victim user can access. Version 2.55.0 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat","events":[{"introduced":"fe148d492b19c9ec35a95c1cb2927d360fd20675"},{"fixed":"ecd97dd8ae74dc757900f2a40da34aae62c2449d"}]}],"versions":["v2.10.0","v2.10.1","v2.10.2","v2.10.3","v2.11.0","v2.11.1","v2.11.2","v2.11.3","v2.12.0","v2.12.1","v2.13.0","v2.14.0","v2.14.1","v2.14.2","v2.14.3","v2.14.4","v2.15.0","v2.16.0","v2.16.1","v2.16.2","v2.16.3","v2.17.0","v2.18.0","v2.19.0","v2.19.1","v2.2.0","v2.20.0","v2.21.0","v2.21.1","v2.21.2","v2.21.3","v2.22.0","v2.23.0","v2.23.1","v2.24.0","v2.25.0","v2.26.0","v2.26.1","v2.27.0","v2.28.0","v2.29.0","v2.3.0","v2.30.0","v2.31.0","v2.32.0","v2.33.0","v2.34.0","v2.35.0","v2.36.0","v2.37.0","v2.38.0","v2.39.0","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.2","v2.4.3","v2.4.4","v2.4.5","v2.4.6","v2.4.7","v2.4.8","v2.4.9","v2.40.0","v2.40.1","v2.41.0","v2.42.0","v2.43.0","v2.44.0","v2.44.1","v2.44.3","v2.45.0","v2.46.0","v2.46.1","v2.47.0","v2.48.0","v2.48.1","v2.49.0","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v2.5.2","v2.50.0","v2.51.0","v2.52.0","v2.53.0","v2.54.0","v2.6.0","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.7.0","v2.7.1","v2.7.2","v2.7.3","v2.7.4","v2.7.5","v2.7.6","v2.8.0","v2.8.1","v2.8.2","v2.9.0","v2.9.1","v2.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23516.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23516.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/commit/40800707fe39e3ff76c8d036eb953eb12d764e70"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/security/advisories/GHSA-3m7p-wx65-c7mp"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23516"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-83"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23516.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
