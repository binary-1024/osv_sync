A maliciouly crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculation to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result the hfsplus_open_compressed_real() function will write past of the internal buffer length. This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grub's internal critical data and may result in arbitrary code execution by-passing secure boot protections.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-1125"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2346138"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2025-02/msg00024.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
