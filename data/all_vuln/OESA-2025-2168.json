  "details": "Apache HTTP Server is a powerful and flexible HTTP/1.1 compliant web server.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nHTTP response splitting in the core of Apache HTTP Server allows an attacker who can manipulate the Content-Type response headers of applications hosted or proxied by the server can split the HTTP response.\n\nThis vulnerability was described as CVE-2023-38709 but the patch included in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 did not address the issue.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.64, which fixes this issue.(CVE-2024-42516)\n\nSSRF in Apache HTTP Server with mod_proxy loaded allows an attacker to send outbound proxy requests to a URL controlled by the attacker.\u00a0 Requires an unlikely configuration where mod_headers is configured to modify the Content-Type request or response header with a value provided in the HTTP request.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.64 which fixes this issue.(CVE-2024-43204)\n\nInsufficient escaping of user-supplied data in mod_ssl in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.63 and earlier allows an untrusted SSL/TLS client to insert escape characters into log files in some configurations.\n\nIn a logging configuration where CustomLog is used with &quot;%{varname}x&quot; or &quot;%{varname}c&quot; to log variables provided by mod_ssl such as SSL_TLS_SNI, no escaping is performed by either mod_log_config or mod_ssl and unsanitized data provided by the client may appear in log files.(CVE-2024-47252)\n\nIn some mod_ssl configurations on Apache HTTP Server 2.4.35 through to 2.4.63, an access control bypass by trusted clients is possible using TLS 1.3 session resumption.\n\nConfigurations are affected when mod_ssl is configured for multiple virtual hosts, with each restricted to a different set of trusted client certificates (for example with a different SSLCACertificateFile/Path setting). In such a case, a client trusted to access one virtual host may be able to access another virtual host, if SSLStrictSNIVHostCheck is not enabled in either virtual host.(CVE-2025-23048)\n\nIn some mod_ssl configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions through to 2.4.63, an HTTP desynchronisation attack allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to hijack an HTTP session via a TLS upgrade.\n\nOnly configurations using &quot;SSLEngine optional&quot; to enable TLS upgrades are affected. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.64, which removes support for TLS upgrade.(CVE-2025-49812)",
