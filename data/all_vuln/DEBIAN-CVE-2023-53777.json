As a consequence, the corresponding file pages will remain locked forever.  It can be _only_ observed on data-deduplicated compressed images. For example, consider two chains with five pclusters in total: \tChain 1:  2->3->4->5    -- The tail pcluster is 5;         Chain 2:  5->1->2       -- The tail pcluster is 2.  Chain 2 could link to Chain 1 with pcluster 5; and Chain 1 could link to Chain 2 at the same time with pcluster 2.  Since hooked chains are all linked locklessly now, I have no idea how to simply avoid the race.  Instead, let's avoid hooked chains completely until I could work out a proper way to fix this and end users finally tell us that it's needed to add it back.  Actually, this optimization can be found with multi-threaded workloads (especially even more often on deduplicated compressed images), yet I'm not sure about the overall system impacts of not having this compared with implementation complexity.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.52-1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.27-1","6.1.37-1","6.1.38-1","6.1.38-2","6.1.38-2~bpo11+1","6.1.38-3","6.1.38-4","6.1.38-4~bpo11+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53777.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.4.4-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53777.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.4.4-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53777.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-53777"}]}
