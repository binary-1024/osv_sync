Versions 1.7.28 and below, 2.0.0-beta.0 through 2.0.6, 2.1.0-beta.0 through 2.1.4, and 2.2.0-beta.0 through 2.2.0-rc.1 contain a bug in the CRI Attach implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the host due to goroutine leaks. This issue is fixed in versions 1.7.29, 2.0.7, 2.1.5 and 2.2.0. To workaround this vulnerability, users can set up an admission controller to control accesses to pods/attach resources.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"containerd","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/containerd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.4.12~ds1-1~deb11u1","1.4.13~ds1-1~deb11u1","1.4.13~ds1-1~deb11u2","1.4.13~ds1-1~deb11u3","1.4.13~ds1-1~deb11u4","1.4.13~ds1-1~deb11u5","1.4.5~ds1-2","1.4.5~ds1-2+deb11u1","1.5.0~beta0~ds1-1","1.5.0~beta1~ds1-1","1.5.0~beta1~ds1-2","1.5.0~beta2~ds1-1","1.5.0~beta3~ds1-1","1.5.0~beta4~ds1-1","1.5.0~rc0~ds1-1","1.5.0~rc1~ds1-1","1.5.2~ds1-1","1.5.3~ds1-1","1.5.4~ds1-1","1.5.5~ds1-1","1.5.7~ds1-1","1.5.7~ds1-2","1.5.8~ds1-1","1.5.8~ds1-2","1.5.8~ds1-3","1.5.9~ds1-1","1.6.0~ds1-1","1.6.0~ds1-2","1.6.0~ds1-3","1.6.0~ds1-4","1.6.0~ds1-5","1.6.11~ds1-1","1.6.12~ds1-1","1.6.13~ds1-1","1.6.14~ds1-1","1.6.16~ds1-1","1.6.17~ds1-1","1.6.18~ds1-1","1.6.1~ds1-1","1.6.20~ds1-1","1.6.20~ds1-2","1.6.24~ds1-1","1.6.24~ds1-2","1.6.2~ds1-1","1.6.6~ds1-1","1.6.8~ds1-1","1.6.9~ds1-1","1.7.18~ds1-1","1.7.18~ds1-2","1.7.18~ds1-3","1.7.18~ds1-4","1.7.18~ds1-5","1.7.18~ds1-6","1.7.18~ds2-1","1.7.20~ds2-1","1.7.20~ds2-2","1.7.21~ds2-1","1.7.22~ds1-1","1.7.23~ds1-1","1.7.23~ds1-2","1.7.23~ds1-3","1.7.23~ds2-1","1.7.24~ds1-1","1.7.24~ds1-10","1.7.24~ds1-2","1.7.24~ds1-3","1.7.24~ds1-4","1.7.24~ds1-5","1.7.24~ds1-6","1.7.24~ds1-7","1.7.24~ds1-8","1.7.24~ds1-9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-64329.json"}},{"package":{"name":"containerd","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/containerd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.6.20~ds1-1","1.6.20~ds1-1+deb12u1","1.6.20~ds1-2","1.6.24~ds1-1","1.6.24~ds1-2","1.7.18~ds1-1","1.7.18~ds1-2","1.7.18~ds1-3","1.7.18~ds1-4","1.7.18~ds1-5","1.7.18~ds1-6","1.7.18~ds2-1","1.7.20~ds2-1","1.7.20~ds2-2","1.7.21~ds2-1","1.7.22~ds1-1","1.7.23~ds1-1","1.7.23~ds1-2","1.7.23~ds1-3","1.7.23~ds2-1","1.7.24~ds1-1","1.7.24~ds1-10","1.7.24~ds1-2","1.7.24~ds1-3","1.7.24~ds1-4","1.7.24~ds1-5","1.7.24~ds1-6","1.7.24~ds1-7","1.7.24~ds1-8","1.7.24~ds1-9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-64329.json"}},{"package":{"name":"containerd","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/containerd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.7.24~ds1-10","1.7.24~ds1-6","1.7.24~ds1-7","1.7.24~ds1-8","1.7.24~ds1-9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-64329.json"}},{"package":{"name":"containerd","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/containerd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.7.24~ds1-10"}]}],"versions":["1.7.24~ds1-6","1.7.24~ds1-7","1.7.24~ds1-8","1.7.24~ds1-9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-64329.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-64329"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
