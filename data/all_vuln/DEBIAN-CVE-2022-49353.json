The panic is of the form below and is observed only with following option disabled(profile) for the said LPAR 'Enable Performance Information Collection' in the HMC:   Kernel attempted to write user page (1c) - exploit attempt? (uid: 0)  BUG: Kernel NULL pointer dereference on write at 0x0000001c  Faulting instruction address: 0xc008000001b90844  Oops: Kernel access of bad area, sig: 11 [#1] <snip>  NIP [c008000001b90844] drc_pmem_query_stats+0x5c/0x270 [papr_scm]  LR [c008000001b92794] papr_scm_probe+0x2ac/0x6ec [papr_scm]  Call Trace:        0xc00000000941bca0 (unreliable)        papr_scm_probe+0x2ac/0x6ec [papr_scm]        platform_probe+0x98/0x150        really_probe+0xfc/0x510        __driver_probe_device+0x17c/0x230 <snip>  ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---  Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception  On investigation looks like this panic was caused due to a 'stat_buffer' of size==0 being provided to drc_pmem_query_stats() to fetch all performance stats-ids of an NVDIMM. However drc_pmem_query_stats() shouldn't have been called since the vPMEM NVDIMM doesn't support and performance stat-id's. This was caused due to missing check for 'p->stat_buffer_len' at the beginning of papr_scm_pmu_check_events() which indicates that the NVDIMM doesn't support performance-stats.  Fix this by introducing the check for 'p->stat_buffer_len' at the beginning of papr_scm_pmu_check_events().
