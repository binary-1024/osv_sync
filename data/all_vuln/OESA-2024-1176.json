  "details": "The Linux Kernel, the operating system core itself.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nTransmit requests in Xen&apos;s virtual network protocol can consist of\nmultiple parts.  While not really useful, except for the initial part\nany of them may be of zero length, i.e. carry no data at all.  Besides a\ncertain initial portion of the to be transferred data, these parts are\ndirectly translated into what Linux calls SKB fragments.  Such converted\nrequest parts can, when for a particular SKB they are all of length\nzero, lead to a de-reference of NULL in core networking code.\n(CVE-2023-46838)\r\n\r\nA flaw in the routing table size was found in the ICMPv6 handling of &quot;Packet Too Big&quot;. The size of the routing table is regulated by periodic garbage collection. However, with &quot;Packet Too Big Messages&quot; it is possible to exceed the routing table size and garbage collector threshold. A user located in the local network or with a high bandwidth connection can increase the CPU usage of the server that accepts IPV6 connections up to 95%.(CVE-2023-52340)\r\n\r\nA denial of service vulnerability due to a deadlock was found in sctp_auto_asconf_init in net/sctp/socket.c in the Linux kernel\u2019s SCTP subsystem. This flaw allows guests with local user privileges to trigger a deadlock and potentially crash the system.(CVE-2024-0639)\r\n\r\nA null pointer dereference flaw was found in the hugetlbfs_fill_super function in the Linux kernel hugetlbfs (HugeTLB pages) functionality. This issue may allow a local user to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2024-0841)\r\n\r\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel&apos;s netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\r\n\r\nThe nft_verdict_init() function allows positive values as drop error within the hook verdict, and hence the nf_hook_slow() function can cause a double free vulnerability when NF_DROP is issued with a drop error which resembles NF_ACCEPT.\r\n\r\nWe recommend upgrading past commit f342de4e2f33e0e39165d8639387aa6c19dff660.\r\n\r\n(CVE-2024-1086)\r\n\r\nIn rds_recv_track_latency in net/rds/af_rds.c in the Linux kernel through 6.7.1, there is an off-by-one error for an RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX comparison, resulting in out-of-bounds access.(CVE-2024-23849)",
