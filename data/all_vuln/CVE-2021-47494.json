This trivially\nfixes the bug since we hold one wdev's lock already, and now\nwill hold the lock that protects all lists.","references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/09b1d5dc6ce1c9151777f6c4e128a59457704c97"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3c897f39b71fe68f90599f6a45b5f7bf5618420e"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4c22227e39c7a0b4dab55617ee8d34d171fab8d4"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
