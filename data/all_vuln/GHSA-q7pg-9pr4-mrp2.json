  "details": "### Summary\nHMAC signature comparison is not timing-safe and is vulnerable to timing attacks.\n\n### Details\n`SharedKey::sign()` returns a `Vec<u8>` which has a non-constant-time equality implementation.\n\n`Hmac::finalize()` returns a constant-time wrapper ([`CtOutput`](https://docs.rs/digest/0.10.7/digest/struct.CtOutput.html)) which was discarded. Alternatively, `Hmac` has a constant-time `verify()` method.\n\nThe problem reported here is due to the following lines in `SharedKey::sign()` of the previous code:\n```rust\nlet mut mac = HmacSha256::new_from_slice(key).unwrap();\nmac.update(data);\nOk(mac.finalize().into_bytes().to_vec())\n```\nand the merged update changes the third line to directly verify with `verify_slice`.\n\n### Impact\n\nAnyone who uses HS256 signature verification is vulnerably to Timing Attack that allows the attacker to forge a signature.",
