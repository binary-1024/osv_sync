Note that this vulnerability is caused by the incomplete patch of CVE-2018-20662.(CVE-2022-37050)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Poppler 22.07.0. There is a reachable abort which leads to denial of service because the main function in pdfunite.cc lacks a stream check before saving an embedded file.(CVE-2022-37051)\r\n\r\nA reachable Object::getString assertion in Poppler 22.07.0 allows attackers to cause a denial of service due to a failure in markObject.(CVE-2022-37052)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Poppler 22.08.0.
