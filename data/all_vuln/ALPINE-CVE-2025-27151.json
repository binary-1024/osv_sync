In versions starting from 7.0.0 to before 8.0.2, a stack-based buffer overflow exists in redis-check-aof due to the use of memcpy with strlen(filepath) when copying a user-supplied file path into a fixed-size stack buffer. This allows an attacker to overflow the stack and potentially achieve code execution. This issue has been patched in version 8.0.2.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"redis","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/redis?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.0.15-r4"}]}],"versions":["2.4.14-r0","2.4.14-r1","2.4.14-r2","2.4.16-r0","2.6.16-r0","2.6.17-r0","2.8.10-r0","2.8.11-r0","2.8.12-r0","2.8.13-r0","2.8.14-r0","2.8.17-r0","2.8.19-r0","2.8.9-r0","2.8.9-r1","2.8.9-r2","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.1-r0","3.0.2-r0","3.0.3-r0","3.0.4-r0","3.0.5-r0","3.0.5-r1","3.0.6-r0","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.2.0-r0","3.2.1-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.4-r0","3.2.5-r0","3.2.7-r0","3.2.8-r0","3.2.9-r0","4.0.10-r0","4.0.10-r1","4.0.11-r0","4.0.12-r0","4.0.13-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.5-r0","4.0.6-r0","4.0.8-r0","4.0.9-r0","4.0.9-r1","4.0.9-r2","5.0.4-r0","5.0.5-r0","5.0.7-r0","5.0.8-r0","5.0.9-r0","6.0.1-r0","6.0.10-r0","6.0.4-r0","6.0.5-r0","6.0.9-r0","6.2.0-r0","6.2.1-r0","6.2.2-r0","6.2.3-r0","6.2.4-r0","6.2.5-r0","6.2.6-r0","6.2.7-r0","7.0.0-r0","7.0.10-r0","7.0.10-r1","7.0.11-r0","7.0.12-r0","7.0.13-r0","7.0.14-r0","7.0.15-r0","7.0.15-r1","7.0.15-r2","7.0.15-r3","7.0.2-r0","7.0.3-r0","7.0.4-r0","7.0.4-r1","7.0.4-r2","7.0.5-r0","7.0.6-r0","7.0.7-r0","7.0.8-r0","7.0.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-27151.json"}},{"package":{"name":"redis","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/redis?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.2.9-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.14-r0","2.4.14-r1","2.4.14-r2","2.4.16-r0","2.6.16-r0","2.6.17-r0","2.8.10-r0","2.8.11-r0","2.8.12-r0","2.8.13-r0","2.8.14-r0","2.8.17-r0","2.8.19-r0","2.8.9-r0","2.8.9-r1","2.8.9-r2","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.1-r0","3.0.2-r0","3.0.3-r0","3.0.4-r0","3.0.5-r0","3.0.5-r1","3.0.6-r0","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.2.0-r0","3.2.1-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.4-r0","3.2.5-r0","3.2.7-r0","3.2.8-r0","3.2.9-r0","4.0.10-r0","4.0.10-r1","4.0.11-r0","4.0.12-r0","4.0.13-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.5-r0","4.0.6-r0","4.0.8-r0","4.0.9-r0","4.0.9-r1","4.0.9-r2","5.0.4-r0","5.0.5-r0","5.0.7-r0","5.0.8-r0","5.0.9-r0","6.0.1-r0","6.0.10-r0","6.0.4-r0","6.0.5-r0","6.0.9-r0","6.2.0-r0","6.2.1-r0","6.2.2-r0","6.2.3-r0","6.2.4-r0","6.2.5-r0","6.2.6-r0","6.2.7-r0","7.0.0-r0","7.0.10-r0","7.0.10-r1","7.0.11-r0","7.0.12-r0","7.0.2-r0","7.0.3-r0","7.0.4-r0","7.0.4-r1","7.0.4-r2","7.0.5-r0","7.0.6-r0","7.0.7-r0","7.0.8-r0","7.0.9-r0","7.2.0-r0","7.2.1-r0","7.2.2-r0","7.2.3-r0","7.2.4-r0","7.2.4-r1","7.2.7-r0","7.2.8-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-27151.json"}},{"package":{"name":"valkey","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/valkey?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.2.9-r1"}]}],"versions":["7.2.5-r0","7.2.5-r1","7.2.5-r2","7.2.7-r0","7.2.8-r0","7.2.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-27151.json"}},{"package":{"name":"valkey","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/valkey?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.2.9-r1"}]}],"versions":["7.2.5-r0","7.2.5-r1","7.2.5-r2","7.2.7-r0","7.2.8-r0","7.2.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-27151.json"}},{"package":{"name":"valkey","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/valkey?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.1.1-r1"}]}],"versions":["7.2.5-r0","7.2.5-r1","7.2.5-r2","7.2.7-r0","7.2.8-r0","7.2.9-r0","8.1.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-27151.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2025-27151"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
