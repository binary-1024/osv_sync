  "details": "This kernel update is based on upstream -longterm 3.14.41 and fixes\nthe following security issues:\n\nnet/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto_generic.c in the Linux kernel before\n3.18 generates incorrect conntrack entries during handling of certain\niptables rule sets for the SCTP, DCCP, GRE, and UDP-Lite protocols,\nwhich allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions\nvia packets with disallowed port numbers (CVE-2014-8160).\n\nThe em_sysenter function in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the Linux kernel\nbefore 3.18.5, when the guest OS lacks SYSENTER MSR initialization,\nallows guest OS users to gain guest OS privileges or cause a denial of\nservice (guest OS crash) by triggering use of a 16-bit code segment for\nemulation of a SYSENTER instruction (CVE-2015-0239).\n\nIt was found that the Linux kernel's ping socket implementation didn't\nproperly handle socket unhashing during spurious disconnects which could\nlead to use-after-free flaw. On x86-64 architecture systems, a local user\nable to create ping sockets could use this flaw to crash the system. On\nnon-x86-64 architecture systems, a local user able to create ping sockets\ncould use this flaw to increase their privileges on the system.\nNote: By default ping sockets are disabled on the system \n(net.ipv4.ping_group_range = 1  0) and have to be explicitly enabled by the\nsystem administrator for specific user groups in order to exploit this issue\n(CVE-2015-3636).\n\nFor other fixes in this update, see the referenced changelogs.\n",
