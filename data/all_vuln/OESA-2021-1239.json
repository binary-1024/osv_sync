These libraries provide critical APIs including ISO C11, POSIX.1-2008, BSD, OS-specific APIs and more. These APIs include such foundational facilities as open, read, write, malloc, printf, getaddrinfo, dlopen, pthread_create, crypt, login, exit and more.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nThe mq_notify function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc) versions 2.32 and 2.33 has a use-after-free.
