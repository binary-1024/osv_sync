  "details": "If an object prototype was corrupted by an attacker, they would have been able\nto set undesired attributes on a JavaScript object, leading to privileged code\nexecution (CVE-2022-2200).\n\nAn attacker could have injected CSS into stylesheets accessible via internal\nURIs, such as resource:, and in doing so bypass a page's Content Security\nPolicy (CVE-2022-31744).\n\nContent Security Policy sandbox header without `allow-scripts` can be bypassed\nvia retargeted javascript: URI. An iframe that was not permitted to run\nscripts could do so if the user clicked on a javascript: link\n(CVE-2022-34468).\n\nNavigations between XML documents may have led to a use-after-free in\nnsSHistory and potentially exploitable crash (CVE-2022-34470).\n\nIf there was a PAC URL set and the server that hosts the PAC was not\nreachable, OCSP requests would have been blocked, resulting in incorrect error\npages being shown (CVE-2022-34472).\n\nA malicious website that could create a popup could have resized the popup to\noverlay the address bar with its own content, resulting in potential user\nconfusion or spoofing attacks (CVE-2022-34479).\n\nIn the nsTArray_Impl::ReplaceElementsAt() function, an integer overflow could\nhave occurred when the number of elements to replace was too large for the\ncontainer (CVE-2022-34481).\n\nThe Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported potential vulnerabilities present in Firefox\nESR 91.10. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we\npresume that with enough effort \n",
