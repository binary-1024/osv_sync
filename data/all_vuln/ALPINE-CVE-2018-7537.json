{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2018-7537","published":"2018-03-09T20:29:00.660Z","modified":"2025-11-19T06:14:23.966887Z","upstream":["CVE-2018-7537"],"details":"An issue was discovered in Django 2.0 before 2.0.3, 1.11 before 1.11.11, and 1.8 before 1.8.19. If django.utils.text.Truncator's chars() and words() methods were passed the html=True argument, they were extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs due to a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability in a regular expression. The chars() and words() methods are used to implement the truncatechars_html and truncatewords_html template filters, which were thus vulnerable.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"py-django","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py-django?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.11-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.5-r0","1.10.7-r0","1.11-r0","1.11-r1","1.11.10-r0","1.11.5-r0","1.11.9-r0","1.2.5-r0","1.2.5-r1","1.4.1-r0","1.5-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.5-r0","1.5.6-r0","1.5.7-r0","1.5.8-r0","1.6.5-r0","1.6.6-r0","1.7-r0","1.8-r0","1.8.10-r0","1.8.12-r0","1.8.14-r0","1.8.15-r0","1.8.16-r0","1.8.3-r0","1.8.4-r0","1.8.6-r0","1.8.7-r0","1.8.8-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-7537.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py-django","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.4","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py-django?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.8.19-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.5-r0","1.2.5-r1","1.4.1-r0","1.5-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.5-r0","1.5.6-r0","1.5.7-r0","1.5.8-r0","1.6.5-r0","1.6.6-r0","1.7-r0","1.8-r0","1.8.10-r0","1.8.12-r0","1.8.14-r0","1.8.15-r0","1.8.16-r0","1.8.18-r0","1.8.3-r0","1.8.4-r0","1.8.6-r0","1.8.7-r0","1.8.8-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-7537.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py-django","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.5","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py-django?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.8.19-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.5-r0","1.2.5-r1","1.4.1-r0","1.5-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.5-r0","1.5.6-r0","1.5.7-r0","1.5.8-r0","1.6.5-r0","1.6.6-r0","1.7-r0","1.8-r0","1.8.10-r0","1.8.12-r0","1.8.14-r0","1.8.15-r0","1.8.16-r0","1.8.18-r0","1.8.3-r0","1.8.4-r0","1.8.6-r0","1.8.7-r0","1.8.8-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-7537.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py-django","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.6","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py-django?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.11-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.5-r0","1.10.7-r0","1.11-r0","1.2.5-r0","1.2.5-r1","1.4.1-r0","1.5-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.5-r0","1.5.6-r0","1.5.7-r0","1.5.8-r0","1.6.5-r0","1.6.6-r0","1.7-r0","1.8-r0","1.8.10-r0","1.8.12-r0","1.8.14-r0","1.8.15-r0","1.8.16-r0","1.8.3-r0","1.8.4-r0","1.8.6-r0","1.8.7-r0","1.8.8-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-7537.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py-django","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.7","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py-django?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.11-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.5-r0","1.10.7-r0","1.11-r0","1.11-r1","1.11.5-r0","1.2.5-r0","1.2.5-r1","1.4.1-r0","1.5-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.5-r0","1.5.6-r0","1.5.7-r0","1.5.8-r0","1.6.5-r0","1.6.6-r0","1.7-r0","1.8-r0","1.8.10-r0","1.8.12-r0","1.8.14-r0","1.8.15-r0","1.8.16-r0","1.8.3-r0","1.8.4-r0","1.8.6-r0","1.8.7-r0","1.8.8-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-7537.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py-django","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.8","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py-django?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.11-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.5-r0","1.10.7-r0","1.11-r0","1.11-r1","1.11.10-r0","1.11.5-r0","1.11.9-r0","1.2.5-r0","1.2.5-r1","1.4.1-r0","1.5-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.5-r0","1.5.6-r0","1.5.7-r0","1.5.8-r0","1.6.5-r0","1.6.6-r0","1.7-r0","1.8-r0","1.8.10-r0","1.8.12-r0","1.8.14-r0","1.8.15-r0","1.8.16-r0","1.8.3-r0","1.8.4-r0","1.8.6-r0","1.8.7-r0","1.8.8-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-7537.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py-django","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.9","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py-django?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.11-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.5-r0","1.10.7-r0","1.11-r0","1.11-r1","1.11.10-r0","1.11.5-r0","1.11.9-r0","1.2.5-r0","1.2.5-r1","1.4.1-r0","1.5-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.5-r0","1.5.6-r0","1.5.7-r0","1.5.8-r0","1.6.5-r0","1.6.6-r0","1.7-r0","1.8-r0","1.8.10-r0","1.8.12-r0","1.8.14-r0","1.8.15-r0","1.8.16-r0","1.8.3-r0","1.8.4-r0","1.8.6-r0","1.8.7-r0","1.8.8-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-7537.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-django","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-django?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.11-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.5-r0","1.10.7-r0","1.11-r0","1.11-r1","1.11.10-r0","1.11.5-r0","1.11.9-r0","1.2.5-r0","1.2.5-r1","1.4.1-r0","1.5-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.5-r0","1.5.6-r0","1.5.7-r0","1.5.8-r0","1.6.5-r0","1.6.6-r0","1.7-r0","1.8-r0","1.8.10-r0","1.8.12-r0","1.8.14-r0","1.8.15-r0","1.8.16-r0","1.8.3-r0","1.8.4-r0","1.8.6-r0","1.8.7-r0","1.8.8-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alp
