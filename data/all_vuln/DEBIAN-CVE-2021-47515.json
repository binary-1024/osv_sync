{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47515","published":"2024-05-24T15:15:12Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:15:31.475183Z","upstream":["CVE-2021-47515"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  seg6: fix the iif in the IPv6 socket control block  When an IPv4 packet is received, the ip_rcv_core(...) sets the receiving interface index into the IPv4 socket control block (v5.16-rc4, net/ipv4/ip_input.c line 510):      IPCB(skb)->iif = skb->skb_iif;  If that IPv4 packet is meant to be encapsulated in an outer IPv6+SRH header, the seg6_do_srh_encap(...) performs the required encapsulation. In this case, the seg6_do_srh_encap function clears the IPv6 socket control block (v5.16-rc4 net/ipv6/seg6_iptunnel.c line 163):      memset(IP6CB(skb), 0, sizeof(*IP6CB(skb)));  The memset(...) was introduced in commit ef489749aae5 (\"ipv6: sr: clear IP6CB(skb) on SRH ip4ip6 encapsulation\") a long time ago (2019-01-29).  Since the IPv6 socket control block and the IPv4 socket control block share the same memory area (skb->cb), the receiving interface index info is lost (IP6CB(skb)->iif is set to zero).  As a side effect, that condition triggers a NULL pointer dereference if commit 0857d6f8c759 (\"ipv6: When forwarding count rx stats on the orig netdev\") is applied.  To fix that issue, we set the IP6CB(skb)->iif with the index of the receiving interface once again.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.92-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47515.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.15.15-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47515.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.15.15-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47515.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.15.15-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47515.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-47515"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
