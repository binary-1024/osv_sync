This vulnerability is a \"write-what-where\" condition, triggered when the library processes a specially crafted TIFF image file.  By providing an abnormally large image height value in the file's metadata, an attacker can trick the library into writing attacker-controlled color data to an arbitrary memory location. This memory corruption can be exploited to cause a denial of service (application crash) or to achieve arbitrary code execution with the permissions of the user.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"tiff","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/tiff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.2.0-1+deb11u7"}]}],"versions":["4.2.0-1","4.2.0-1+deb11u1","4.2.0-1+deb11u2","4.2.0-1+deb11u3","4.2.0-1+deb11u4","4.2.0-1+deb11u5","4.2.0-1+deb11u6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-9900.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tiff","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/tiff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.5.0-6+deb12u3"}]}],"versions":["4.5.0-6","4.5.0-6+deb12u1","4.5.0-6+deb12u2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-9900.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tiff","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/tiff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.7.0-3+deb13u1"}]}],"versions":["4.7.0-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-9900.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tiff","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/tiff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.7.1-1"}]}],"versions":["4.7.0-3","4.7.0-4","4.7.0-5"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-9900.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-9900"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
