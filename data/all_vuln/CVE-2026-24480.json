Workflows triggered by `pull_request_target` ran with the base repository's credentials and access to secrets. If these workflows then checked out and executed code from the head of an external pull request (which could have been attacker controlled), the attacker could have executed arbitrary commands with elevated privileges. This insecure pattern has been documented as a security risk by GitHub and security researchers. Commit 76a693cd91650f9b4e83edac525e5e4f90d954e9 removed the vulnerable code.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/qgis/qgis","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"76a693cd91650f9b4e83edac525e5e4f90d954e9"}]}],"versions":["Before-merge-new_vector_api","final-1_8_0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24480.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24480.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/76a693cd91650f9b4e83edac525e5e4f90d954e9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/security/advisories/GHSA-7h99-4f97-h6rw"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24480"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-863"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24480.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
