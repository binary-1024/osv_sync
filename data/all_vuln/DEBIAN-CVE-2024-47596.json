An OOB-read has been discovered in the qtdemux_parse_svq3_stsd_data function within qtdemux.c. In the FOURCC_SMI_ case, seqh_size is read from the input file without proper validation. If seqh_size is greater than the remaining size of the data buffer, it can lead to an OOB-read in the following call to gst_buffer_fill, which internally uses memcpy. This vulnerability can result in reading up to 4GB of process memory or potentially causing a segmentation fault (SEGV) when accessing invalid memory. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-good1.0","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gst-plugins-good1.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.18.4-2+deb11u3"}]}],"versions":["1.18.4-2","1.18.4-2+deb11u1","1.18.4-2+deb11u2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47596.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-good1.0","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gst-plugins-good1.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.22.0-5+deb12u2"}]}],"versions":["1.22.0-5","1.22.0-5+deb12u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47596.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-good1.0","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gst-plugins-good1.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.24.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47596.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-good1.0","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gst-plugins-good1.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.24.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47596.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-47596"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
