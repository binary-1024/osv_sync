{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-66456","published":"2025-12-09T19:43:10.252Z","modified":"2026-01-28T19:51:13.189119Z","aliases":["GHSA-hxj9-33pp-j2cc"],"related":["GHSA-8vch-m3f4-q8jf","GHSA-hxj9-33pp-j2cc"],"summary":"Elysia vulnerable to prototype pollution with multiple standalone schema validation","details":"Elysia is a Typescript framework for request validation, type inference, OpenAPI documentation and client-server communication. Versions 1.4.0 through 1.4.16 contain a prototype pollution vulnerability in `mergeDeep` after merging results of two standard schema validations with the same key. Due to the ordering of merging, there must be an any type that is set as a standalone guard, to allow for the `__proto__ prop` to be merged. When combined with GHSA-8vch-m3f4-q8jf this allows for a full RCE by an attacker. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.17. To workaround, remove the `__proto__ key` from body.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/elysiajs/elysia","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"26935bf76ebc43b4a43d48b173fc853de43bb51e"},{"fixed":"3af978663e437dccc6c1a2a3aff4b74e1574849e"}]}],"versions":["0.0.0-experimental.28","0.0.0-experimental.29","0.0.0-experimental.37","0.0.0-experimental.39","0.0.0-experimental.51","0.1","0.2","0.2.0","0.3","0.3-rc","0.4","0.5","0.6","0.7","0.8","0.8.0-exp.10","1.0","1.1","1.1.12","1.1.13","1.1.14","1.1.15","1.1.16","1.1.17","1.1.18","1.1.19","1.1.20","1.1.21","1.1.22","1.1.23","1.1.24","1.1.25","1.1.26","1.1.27","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.10","1.2.11","1.2.12","1.2.13","1.2.14","1.2.15","1.2.16","1.2.17","1.2.18","1.2.19","1.2.2","1.2.20","1.2.21","1.2.22","1.2.23","1.2.24","1.2.25","1.2.3","1.2.4","1.2.5","1.2.6","1.2.7","1.2.8","1.2.9","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.10","1.3.11","1.3.12","1.3.13","1.3.14","1.3.15","1.3.16","1.3.17","1.3.18","1.3.19","1.3.2","1.3.20","1.3.21","1.3.3","1.3.4","1.3.5","1.3.6","1.3.7","1.3.8","1.3.9","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.10","1.4.11","1.4.12","1.4.13","1.4.14","1.4.15","1.4.16","1.4.2","1.4.3","1.4.4","1.4.5","1.4.6","1.4.7","1.4.8","1.4.9","v0.4.12","v0.5.0-beta.1","v0.5.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66456.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66456.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/elysiajs/elysia/commit/26935bf76ebc43b4a43d48b173fc853de43bb51e"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/elysiajs/elysia/commit/3af978663e437dccc6c1a2a3aff4b74e1574849e"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/elysiajs/elysia/pull/1564"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/elysiajs/elysia/security/advisories/GHSA-8vch-m3f4-q8jf"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/elysiajs/elysia/security/advisories/GHSA-hxj9-33pp-j2cc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66456"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-1321"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66456.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
