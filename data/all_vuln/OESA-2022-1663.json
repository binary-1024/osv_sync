  "details": "Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert a Java object into its JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string into an equivalent Java object. Gson can work with arbitrary Java objects including pre-existing objects that you do not have source-code of. There are a few open-source projects that can convert Java objects to JSON. However, most of them require that you place Java annotations in your classes; something that you can not do if you do not have access to the source-code. Most also do not fully support the use of Java Generics. Gson considers both of these as very important design goals.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nThe package com.google.code.gson:gson before 2.8.9 are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data via the writeReplace() method in internal classes, which may lead to DoS attacks.(CVE-2022-25647)",
