  "details": "The python-rope utility has been caught passing remotely supplied data to \npickle.load(), enabling possible code-execution attacks. This can happen when\nthe 'perform_doa' (dynamic object analysis) option is enabled, which it\npreviously had been by default.\n\nThis update changes the default configuration to disable this option. This\nonly mitigates the issue, as it will still be vulnerable if the option is\nenabled.\n\nIf 'perform_doa' is enabled, python-rope can be persuaded to open under some\ncircumstances a network port for short moment of time, which can be used to\npush commands to the running process, so the process could run some commands\nunder the privileges of the user running python-rope. Anyone who enables this\noption is advised to make sure the computer is protected by a firewall.\n",
