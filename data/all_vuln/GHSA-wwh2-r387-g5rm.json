  "details": "`tower_http::services::fs::ServeDir` didn't correctly validate Windows paths meaning paths like `/foo/bar/c:/windows/web/screen/img101.png` would be allowed and respond with the contents of `c:/windows/web/screen/img101.png`. Thus users could potentially read files anywhere on the filesystem. This only impacts Windows. Linux and other unix likes are not impacted by this.",
