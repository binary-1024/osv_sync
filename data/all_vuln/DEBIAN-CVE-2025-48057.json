Prior to versions 2.12.12, 2.13.12, and 2.14.6, the VerifyCertificate() function can be tricked into incorrectly treating certificates as valid. This allows an attacker to send a malicious certificate request that is then treated as a renewal of an already existing certificate, resulting in the attacker obtaining a valid certificate that can be used to impersonate trusted nodes. This only occurs when Icinga 2 is built with OpenSSL older than version 1.1.0. This issue has been patched in versions 2.12.12, 2.13.12, and 2.14.6.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"icinga2","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/icinga2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.12.3-1","2.12.3-1+deb11u1","2.12.4-1~exp1","2.12.5-1","2.12.5-1~exp1","2.13.0-1~exp1","2.13.1-1","2.13.2-1","2.13.3-1","2.13.4-1","2.13.5-1","2.13.5-2","2.13.6-1","2.13.6-2","2.13.7-1","2.13.7-1~exp1","2.13.8-1","2.14.0-1~exp1","2.14.1-1","2.14.2-1","2.14.2-1+loong64","2.14.3-1","2.14.4-1","2.14.5-1","2.14.6-1","2.15.0-1","2.15.0-1~exp1","2.15.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-48057.json"}},{"package":{"name":"icinga2","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/icinga2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.13.6-2","2.13.6-2+deb12u1","2.13.6-2+deb12u2","2.13.7-1","2.13.7-1~exp1","2.13.8-1","2.14.0-1~exp1","2.14.1-1","2.14.2-1","2.14.2-1+loong64","2.14.3-1","2.14.4-1","2.14.5-1","2.14.6-1","2.15.0-1","2.15.0-1~exp1","2.15.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-48057.json"}},{"package":{"name":"icinga2","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/icinga2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.14.6-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-48057.json"}},{"package":{"name":"icinga2","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/icinga2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.14.6-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-48057.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-48057"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:L/SI:L/SA:L/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
