Applications built with NSS can support SSL v2 and v3, TLS, PKCS #5, PKCS #7, PKCS #11, PKCS #12, S/MIME, X.509 v3 certificates, and other security standards.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the way CHACHA20-POLY1305 was implemented in NSS. When using multi-part Chacha20, it could cause out-of-bounds reads. This issue was fixed by explicitly disabling multi-part ChaCha20 (which was not functioning correctly) and strictly enforcing tag length. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and system availability.(CVE-2020-12403)\n\nA flaw was found in the way NSS handled CCS (ChangeCipherSpec) messages in TLS 1.3. This flaw allows a remote attacker to send multiple CCS messages, causing a denial of service for servers compiled with the NSS library. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. This flaw affects NSS versions before 3.58.(CVE-2020-25648)",
