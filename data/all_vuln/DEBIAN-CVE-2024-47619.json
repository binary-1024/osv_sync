Prior to version 4.8.2, `tls_wildcard_match()` matches on certificates such as `foo.*.bar` although that is not allowed. It is also possible to pass partial wildcards such as `foo.a*c.bar` which glib matches but should be avoided / invalidated. This issue could have an impact on TLS connections, such as in man-in-the-middle situations. Version 4.8.2 contains a fix for the issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"syslog-ng","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/syslog-ng?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.28.1-2+deb11u2"}]}],"versions":["3.28.1-2","3.28.1-2+deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47619.json"}},{"package":{"name":"syslog-ng","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/syslog-ng?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.38.1-5","4.3.1-1","4.3.1-2","4.4.0-1","4.4.0-2","4.4.0-3","4.8.1-1","4.8.1-2","4.8.1-3","4.8.1-4","4.8.1-5","4.8.1-6","4.8.1-7"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47619.json"}},{"package":{"name":"syslog-ng","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/syslog-ng?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.8.1-5"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47619.json"}},{"package":{"name":"syslog-ng","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/syslog-ng?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.8.1-5"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47619.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-47619"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
