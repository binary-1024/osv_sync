  "details": "Openafs packages have been updated to 1.9.1 for various bugfixes,\nand added a fix for security vulnerability:\n\nThere exist in the wild AFS3 clients that improperly construct access\ncontrol lists which are then stored to directories via RXAFS_StoreACL\n(opcode 134). These clients add negative access control entries (if any)\nto the normal rights list. As there is no method by which a fileserver\ncan determine that the ACL is improperly constructed, the only method\nto defend the storage of broken ACLs is to identify clients that are\nknown to properly construct ACLs by introducing a new RXAFS_StoreACL\nopcode (164) (CVE-2018-7168).\n\nAdditionally the CellServDB has been updated to latest version and\nfixes for suppoorting kernel 5.14 and 5.15 series have been added.\n",
