This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nAffected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented `Send` for `ReadTicket<T>` & `WriteTicket<T>`.\nThis allows to send non-Send `T` to other threads.\n\nThis can allows creating data races by cloning types with internal mutability and sending them to other threads (as `T` of `ReadTicket<T>`/`WriteTicket<T>`). Such data races can cause memory corruption or other undefined behavior.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit `a986a93` by adding `T: Send` bounds to `Send` impls of `ReadTicket<T>`/`WriteTicket<T>`.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ticketed_lock","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/ticketed_lock"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.3.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/08/GHSA-gq4h-f254-7cw9/GHSA-gq4h-f254-7cw9.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/kvark/ticketed_lock/issues/7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/kvark/ticketed_lock/commit/a986a9335d591fa5c826157d1674d47aa525357f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0119.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-362"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2021-08-05T21:48:24Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
