In versions starting from 7.0.0 to before 8.0.2, a stack-based buffer overflow exists in redis-check-aof due to the use of memcpy with strlen(filepath) when copying a user-supplied file path into a fixed-size stack buffer. This allows an attacker to overflow the stack and potentially achieve code execution. This issue has been patched in version 8.0.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/redis/redis","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"643b5db235cb82508e72f11c7b4bbfc7dc39be56"},{"fixed":"994bc96bb1744cb153392fc96bdba43eae56e17f"}]}],"versions":["1.3.6","2.2-alpha0","2.2-alpha1","2.2-alpha2","2.2-alpha3","2.2-alpha4","2.2-alpha5","2.2-alpha6","2.2.0-rc1","2.3-alpha0","3.0-alpha0","8.0-m01","8.0-m02","8.0-m03","8.0-m04","8.0-m04-int","8.0-rc1","8.0-rc1-int","8.0-rc1-int2","8.0-rc2-int","8.0.0","8.0.1","8.0.1-int","v1.3.10","v1.3.11","v1.3.12","v1.3.7","v1.3.8","v1.3.9","v2.0.0-rc1","v2.1.1-watch","vm-playpen","with-deprecated-diskstore"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-27151.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["204361133470043369422735108006951014492","266395016474126643708905170881553865497","291104153020075789859589203955995153601"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2025-27151-3559ed69","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/redis/redis/commit/643b5db235cb82508e72f11c7b4bbfc7dc39be56","target":{"file":"src/redis-check-aof.c"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"327466512985566197169610813840867666992","length":1359},"id":"CVE-2025-27151-bc576423","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/redis/redis/commit/643b5db235cb82508e72f11c7b4bbfc7dc39be56","target":{"file":"src/redis-check-aof.c","function":"redis_check_aof_main"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/commit/643b5db235cb82508e72f11c7b4bbfc7dc39be56"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/8.0.2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-5453-q98w-cmvm"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-121","CWE-20"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
