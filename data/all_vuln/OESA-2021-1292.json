MyBatis couples objects with stored procedures or SQL statements using a XML descriptor or annotations. Simplicity is the biggest advantage of the MyBatis data mapper over object relational mapping tools. To use the MyBatis data mapper, you rely on your own objects, XML, and SQL. There is little to learn that you don&apos;t already know. With the MyBatis data mapper, you have the full power of both SQL and stored procedures at your fingertips. The MyBatis project is developed and maintained by a team that includes the original creators of the &quot;iBATIS&quot; data mapper. The Apache project was retired and continued here.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nMyBatis before 3.5.6 mishandles deserialization of object streams.(CVE-2020-26945)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mybatis","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/mybatis&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.2.8-2.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"noarch":["mybatis-javadoc-3.2.8-2.oe1.noarch.rpm","mybatis-3.2.8-2.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["mybatis-3.2.8-2.oe1.src.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1292.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1292"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26945"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
