A malicious user can exploit the vulnerability by\nsending malicious AMQP messages to the target RabbitMQ instance having\nthe AMQP 1.0 plugin enabled (CVE-2021-22116).\n\nRabbitMQ is a multi-protocol messaging broker. In rabbitmq-server prior\nto version 3.8.17, a new user being added via management UI could lead\nto the user's bane being rendered in a confirmation message without proper\n\"<script>\" tag sanitization, potentially allowing for JavaScript code\nexecution in the context of the page. In order for this to occur, the user\nmust be signed in and have elevated permissions (other user management)\n(CVE-2021-32718).\n\nRabbitMQ is a multi-protocol messaging broker.
