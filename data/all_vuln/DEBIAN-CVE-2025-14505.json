{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-14505","published":"2026-01-08T21:15:42.023Z","modified":"2026-01-09T22:30:01.252538Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-14505"],"details":"The ECDSA implementation of the Elliptic package generates incorrect signatures if an interim value of 'k' (as computed based on step 3.2 of  RFC 6979 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6979 ) has leading zeros and is susceptible to cryptanalysis, which can lead to secret key exposure. This happens, because the byte-length of 'k' is incorrectly computed, resulting in its getting truncated during the computation. Legitimate transactions or communications will be broken as a result. Furthermore, due to the nature of the fault, attackers could–under certain conditions–derive the secret key, if they could get their hands on both a faulty signature generated by a vulnerable version of Elliptic and a correct signature for the same inputs.  This issue affects all known versions of Elliptic (at the time of writing, versions less than or equal to 6.6.1).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"node-elliptic","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-elliptic?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.5.4~dfsg-1","6.5.4~dfsg-2","6.5.7+dfsg-1","6.6.1+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-14505.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-elliptic","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-elliptic?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.5.4~dfsg-2","6.5.7+dfsg-1","6.6.1+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-14505.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-elliptic","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-elliptic?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.6.1+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-14505.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-elliptic","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-elliptic?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.6.1+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-14505.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-14505"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
