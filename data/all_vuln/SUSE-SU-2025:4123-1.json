Make it more neutral. (bsc#930408)\n- Mark the module as supported (bsc#904970)\n- Provide common kallsyms wrapper API With bsc#1103203, the need for disambiguating between a multiply defined symbol arose. This is something the kallsyms_lookup_name() based code snippet we used to copy&paste to every individual CVE fix can't handle. Implement a proper wrapper API for doing the kallsyms lookups.\n- Require exact kernel version in the patch (bsc#920615)\n- Revert 'Require exact kernel version in the patch' This needs to be done differently, so that modprobe --force works as expected. (bsc#920615) This reverts commit c62c11aecd4e3f8822e1b835fea403acc3148c5a.\n- Set immediate flag for the initial patch Setting immediate to true will simplify installation of the initial patch and possibly also of the further updates. (bsc#907150)\n- The stubs' signatures have changed: each argument used to get mapped to either long or long long, but on x86_64, the stubs are now receiving a single struct pt_regs only -- it's their responsibility to extract the arguments as appropriate. In order to not require each and every live patch touching syscalls to include an insane amount of ifdeffery, provide a set of #defines hiding it: 1.) KLP_SYSCALL_SYM(name) expands to the syscall stub name for 64 bits as defined by _SYSCALL_DEFINEx(x, _name, ...). 2.) If the architeture requires 32bit specific stubs for syscalls sharing a common implementation between 32 and 64bits, the KLP_ARCH_HAS_SYSCALL_COMPAT_STUBS macro is defined. 3.) If KLP_ARCH_HAS_SYSCALL_COMPAT_STUBS is defined, then KLP_SYSCALL_COMPAT_STUB_SYM(name) expands to the syscall stub name for 32 bits as defined by _SYSCALL_DEFINEx(x, _name, ...). 4.) For syscalls not sharing a common implementation between 32 and 64 bits, i.e. those defined by COMPAT_SYSCALL_DEFINEx(), the macro KLP_COMPAT_SYSCALL_SYM(name) expands to the stub name defined as defined by COMPAT_SYSCALL_DEFINEx(x, _name, ...). 5.) Finally, for hiding differences between the signatures, provide the macro KLP_SYSCALL_DECLx(x, sym, ...) which expands to a declaration of sym, with the x arguments either mapped to long resp. long long each, or collapsed to a single struct pt_regs argument as appropriate for the architecture. Note that these macros are defined as appropriate on kernels before and after 4.17, so that live patch code can be shared. (bsc#1149841)\n- bsc#1249208: fix livepatching target module name (bsc#1252946)\n- uname_patch: convert to the syscall stub wrapper macros from klp_syscalls.h In order to make the live patch to the newuname() syscall work on kernels >= 4.17 again, convert it to the KLP_SYSCALL_*() wrapper macros provided by klp_syscalls.h.
