{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-4039","published":"2023-09-13T09:15:15Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:16:08.470818Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-4039"],"details":"**DISPUTED**A failure in the -fstack-protector feature in GCC-based toolchains  that target AArch64 allows an attacker to exploit an existing buffer  overflow in dynamically-sized local variables in your application  without this being detected. This stack-protector failure only applies  to C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using  alloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized  local variables.  The default behavior when the stack-protector  detects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in  controlled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer  overflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change  program flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to  go further and affect confidentiality or integrity. NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gcc-10","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gcc-10?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["10.2.1-16","10.2.1-17","10.2.1-18","10.2.1-19","10.2.1-20","10.2.1-21","10.2.1-23","10.2.1-24","10.2.1-6","10.2.1-6+hurd.1","10.3.0-1","10.3.0-10","10.3.0-11","10.3.0-12","10.3.0-13","10.3.0-14","10.3.0-15","10.3.0-16","10.3.0-2","10.3.0-3","10.3.0-4","10.3.0-5","10.3.0-6","10.3.0-7","10.3.0-8","10.3.0-9","10.4.0-1","10.4.0-2","10.4.0-3","10.4.0-4","10.4.0-5","10.4.0-6","10.4.0-7","10.4.0-8","10.4.0-9","10.5.0-1","10.5.0-2","10.5.0-3","10.5.0-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-4039.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gcc-11","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gcc-11?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["11.3.0-12","11.3.0-13","11.3.0-14","11.3.0-15","11.4.0-1","11.4.0-10","11.4.0-2","11.4.0-3","11.4.0-4","11.4.0-5","11.4.0-6","11.4.0-7","11.4.0-8","11.4.0-9","11.5.0-1","11.5.0-2","11.5.0-3","11.5.0-4","11.5.0-5","11.5.0-6","11.5.0-7"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-4039.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gcc-12","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gcc-12?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"12.2.0-14+deb12u1"}]}],"versions":["12.2.0-14"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-4039.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gcc-12","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gcc-12?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"12.3.0-9"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-4039.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gcc-12","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gcc-12?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"12.3.0-9"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-4039.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gcc-13","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gcc-13?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"13.2.0-4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-4039.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gcc-13","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gcc-13?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"13.2.0-4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-4039.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gcc-9","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gcc-9?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["9.3.0-22","9.3.0-23","9.3.0-24","9.3.0-25","9.3.0-26","9.4.0-1","9.4.0-2","9.4.0-3","9.4.0-4","9.4.0-5","9.5.0-1","9.5.0-2","9.5.0-3","9.5.0-4","9.5.0-5","9.5.0-6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-4039.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4039"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
