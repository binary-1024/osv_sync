  "details": "QPDF is a command-line program that does structural, content-preserving transformations on PDF files. It could have been called something like pdf-to-pdf. It also provides many useful capabilities to developers of PDF-producing software or for people who just want to look at the innards of a PDF file to learn more about how they work.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nQPDF v8.4.2 was discovered to contain a heap buffer overflow via the function QPDF::processXRefStream. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted PDF file.(CVE-2022-34503)",
