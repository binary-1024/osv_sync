This means eg. that the shrinker can evict the DPT BO while leaving the actual FB BO bound, when the DPT is allocated from regular shmem.  That causes an immediate oops during hibernate as we try to rewrite the PTEs inside the already evicted DPT obj.  TODO: presumably this might also be the reason for the DPT related display faults under heavy memory pressure, but I'm still not sure how that would happen as the object should be pinned by intel_dpt_pin() while in active use by the display engine...
