  "details": "Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.13 has a stack-based buffer over-read in the disasm\nfunction of the disasm/disasm.c file. Remote attackers could leverage this\nvulnerability to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other\nimpact via a crafted ELF file (CVE-2018-10254).\n\nNetwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0 has an endless while loop in the\nassemble_file function of asm/nasm.c because of a globallineno integer\noverflow (CVE-2018-10316).\n\nNetwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc15 has a buffer over-read in x86/regflags.c\n(CVE-2018-16382).\n\nNASM nasm-2.13.03 nasm- 2.14rc15 version 2.14rc15 and earlier contains a\nmemory corruption (crashed) of nasm when handling a crafted file due to\nfunction assemble_file(inname, depend_ptr) at asm/nasm.c:482. vulnerability in\nfunction assemble_file(inname, depend_ptr) at asm/nasm.c:482. that can result\nin aborting/crash nasm program. This attack appear to be exploitable via a\nspecially crafted asm file (CVE-2018-1000667).\n\nasm/labels.c in Netwide Assembler (NASM) is prone to NULL Pointer Dereference,\nwhich allows the attacker to cause a denial of service via a crafted file\n(CVE-2018-16517).\n\nNetwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc15 has an invalid memory write (segmentation\nfault) in expand_smacro in preproc.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial\nof service via a crafted input file (CVE-2018-16999).\n\nNetwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc16 has a heap-based buffer over-read in\nexpand_mmac_params in asm/preproc.c for the special cases of the % and $ and !\ncharacters (CVE-2018-19215).\n\nNetwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc15 has a heap-based buffer over-read in\nexpand_mmac_params in asm/preproc.c for insufficient input (CVE-2018-19214).\n",
