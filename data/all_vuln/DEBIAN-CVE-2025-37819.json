But, the call back is wrongly marked as __init, causing it to be freed, while being registered with the PCI subsystem and could trigger:   Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff8000816c0400   gicv2m_get_fwnode+0x0/0x58 (P)   pci_set_bus_msi_domain+0x74/0x88   pci_register_host_bridge+0x194/0x548  This is easily reproducible on a Juno board with ACPI boot.
