  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npinctrl: qcom: msm: mark certain pins as invalid for interrupts\n\nOn some platforms, the UFS-reset pin has no interrupt logic in TLMM but\nis nevertheless registered as a GPIO in the kernel. This enables the\nuser-space to trigger a BUG() in the pinctrl-msm driver by running, for\nexample: `gpiomon -c 0 113` on RB2.\n\nThe exact culprit is requesting pins whose intr_detection_width setting\nis not 1 or 2 for interrupts. This hits a BUG() in\nmsm_gpio_irq_set_type(). Potentially crashing the kernel due to an\ninvalid request from user-space is not optimal, so let's go through the\npins and mark those that would fail the check as invalid for the irq chip\nas we should not even register them as available irqs.\n\nThis function can be extended if we determine that there are more\ncorner-cases like this.",
