  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: SOF: ipc4-pcm: Workaround for crashed firmware on system suspend  When the system is suspended while audio is active, the sof_ipc4_pcm_hw_free() is invoked to reset the pipelines since during suspend the DSP is turned off, streams will be re-started after resume.  If the firmware crashes during while audio is running (or when we reset the stream before suspend) then the sof_ipc4_set_multi_pipeline_state() will fail with IPC error and the state change is interrupted. This will cause misalignment between the kernel and firmware state on next DSP boot resulting errors returned by firmware for IPC messages, eventually failing the audio resume. On stream close the errors are ignored so the kernel state will be corrected on the next DSP boot, so the second boot after the DSP panic.  If sof_ipc4_trigger_pipelines() is called from sof_ipc4_pcm_hw_free() then state parameter is SOF_IPC4_PIPE_RESET and only in this case.  Treat a forced pipeline reset similarly to how we treat a pcm_free by ignoring error on state sending to allow the kernel's state to be consistent with the state the firmware will have after the next boot.",
