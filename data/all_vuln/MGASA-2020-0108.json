  "details": "Updated rsync packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nIt was discovered that rsync incorrectly handled pointer arithmetic in\nzlib. An attacker could use this issue to cause rsync to crash, resulting\nin a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code (CVE-2016-9840,\nCVE-2016-9841)\n\nIt was discovered that rsync incorrectly handled vectors involving left\nshifts of negative integers in zlib. An attacker could use this issue to\ncause rsync to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code (CVE-2016-9842).\n\nIt was discovered that rsync incorrectly handled vectors involving big-\nendian CRC calculation in zlib. An attacker could use this issue to cause\nrsync to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute\narbitrary code (CVE-2016-9843).\n\nPlease note, we now compile against system zlib. If rsync fails to sync\nwith older remote systems using compression (-z), you have either update\nthe remote host to a newer version or disable compression.\n",
