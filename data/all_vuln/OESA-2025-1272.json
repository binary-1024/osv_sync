When using aiohttp as a web server and configuring static routes, it is necessary to specify the root path for static files. Additionally, the option &apos;follow_symlinks&apos; can be used to determine whether to follow symbolic links outside the static root directory. When &apos;follow_symlinks&apos; is set to True, there is no validation to check if reading a file is within the root directory. This can lead to directory traversal vulnerabilities, resulting in unauthorized access to arbitrary files on the system, even when symlinks are not present.  Disabling follow_symlinks and using a reverse proxy are encouraged mitigations.  Version 3.9.2 fixes this issue.(CVE-2024-23334)\n\naiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. A XSS vulnerability exists on index pages for static file handling. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.9.4. We have always recommended using a reverse proxy server (e.g. nginx) for serving static files. Users following the recommendation are unaffected. Other users can disable `show_index` if unable to upgrade.(CVE-2024-27306)\n\naiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. In affected versions an attacker can send a specially crafted POST (multipart/form-data) request. When the aiohttp server processes it, the server will enter an infinite loop and be unable to process any further requests. An attacker can stop the application from serving requests after sending a single request. This issue has been addressed in version 3.9.4. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may manually apply a patch to their systems.
