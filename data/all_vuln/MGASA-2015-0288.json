  "details": "Chromium-browser 44.0.2403.107 fixes several security issues:\n\nPDFium, as used in Google Chrome before 44.0.2403.89, does not properly\nhandle certain out-of-memory conditions, which allows remote attackers to\ncause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have\nunspecified other impact via a crafted PDF document that triggers a large\nmemory allocation. (CVE-2015-1271)\n\nUse-after-free vulnerability in the GPU process implementation in Google\nChrome before 44.0.2403.89 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of\nservice or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging the\ncontinued availability of a GPUChannelHost data structure during Blink\nshutdown, related to\ncontent/browser/gpu/browser_gpu_channel_host_factory.cc and\ncontent/renderer/render_thread_impl.cc. (CVE-2015-1272)\n\nHeap-based buffer overflow in j2k.c in OpenJPEG before r3002, as used in\nPDFium in Google Chrome before 44.0.2403.89, allows remote attackers to\ncause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via\ninvalid JPEG2000 data in a PDF document. (CVE-2015-1273)\n\nGoogle Chrome before 44.0.2403.89 does not ensure that the auto-open list\nomits all dangerous file types, which makes it easier for remote attackers\nto execute arbitrary code by providing a crafted file and leveraging a\nuser's previous \"Always open files of this type\" choice, related to\ndownload_commands.cc and download_prefs.cc. (CVE-2015-1274)\n\nUse-after-free vulnerability in\ncontent/browser/indexed_db/indexed_db_backing_store.cc in the IndexedDB\nimplementation in Google Chrome before 44.0.2403.89 allows remote\nattackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other\nimpact by leveraging an abort action before a certain write operation.\n(CVE-2015-1276)\n\nUse-after-free vulnerability in the accessibility implementation in Google\nChrome before 44.0.2403.89 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of\nservice or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging lack of\ncertain validity checks for accessibility-tree data structures.\n(CVE-2015-1277)\n\ncontent/browser/web_contents/web_contents_impl.cc in Google Chrome before\n44.0.2403.89 does not ensure that a PDF document's modal dialog is closed\nupon navigation to an interstitial page, which allows remote attackers to\nspoof URLs via a crafted document, as demonstrated by the alert_dialog.pdf\ndocument. (CVE-2015-1278)\n\nInteger overflow in the CJBig2_Image::expand function in\nfxcodec/jbig2/JBig2_Image.cpp in PDFium, as used in Google Chrome before\n44.0.2403.89, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n(heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via\nlarge height and stride values. (CVE-2015-1279)\n\nSkPictureShader.cpp in Skia, as used in Google Chrome before 44.0.2403.89,\nallows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption)\nor possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging access to a\nrenderer process and providing crafted serialized data. (CVE-2015-1280)\n\ncore/loader/ImageLoader.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before\n44.0.2403.89, does not properly determine the V8 context of a microtask,\nwhich allows remote attackers to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP)\nrestrictions by providing an image from an unintended source.\n(CVE-2015-1281)\n\nMultiple use-after-free vulnerabilities in\nfpdfsdk/src/javascript/Document.cpp in PDFium, as used in Google Chrome\nbefore 44.0.2403.89, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service\nor possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted PDF document,\nrelated to the (1) Document::delay and (2) Document::DoFieldDelay\nfunctions. (CVE-2015-1282)\n\nThe LocalFrame::isURLAllowed function in core/frame/LocalFrame.cpp in\nBlink, as used in Google Chrome before 44.0.2403.89, does not properly\ncheck for a page's maximum number of frames, which allows remote attackers\nto cause a denial of service (invalid count value and use-after-free) or\npossibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JavaScript code that\n makes many createElement calls for IFRAME elements. (CVE-2015-1284)\n\nThe XSSAuditor::canonicalize function in core/html/parser/XSSAuditor.cpp\nin the XSS auditor in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 44.0.2403.89,\ndoes not properly choose a truncation point, which makes it easier for\nremote attackers to obtain sensitive information via an unspecified\nlinear-time attack. (CVE-2015-1285)\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the\nV8ContextNativeHandler::GetModuleSystem function in\nextensions/renderer/v8_context_native_handler.cc in Google Chrome before\n44.0.2403.89 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or\nHTML by leveraging the lack of a certain V8 context restriction, aka a\nBlink \"Universal XSS (UXSS).\" (CVE-2015-1286)\n\nBlink, as used in Google Chrome before 44.0.2403.89, enables a quirks-mode\nexception that limits the cases in which a Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)\ndocument is required to have the text/css content type, which allows\nremote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via a crafted web site,\nrelated to core/fetch/CSSStyleSheetResource.cpp. (CVE-2015-1287)\n\nThe Spellcheck API implementation in Google Chrome before 44.0.2403.89\ndoes not use an HTTPS session for downloading a Hunspell dictionary, which\nallows man-in-the-middle attackers to deliver incorrect spelling\nsuggestions or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file,\na related issue to CVE-2015-1263. (CVE-2015-1288)\n\nMultiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Google Chrome before 44.0.2403.89\nallow attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have other impact\nvia unknown vectors.
