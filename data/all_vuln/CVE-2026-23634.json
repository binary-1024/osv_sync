{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-23634","published":"2026-01-16T19:14:46.483Z","modified":"2026-01-17T02:41:26.602901Z","aliases":["GHSA-w54x-r83c-x79q"],"summary":"Pepr Overly Permissive RBAC ClusterRole in Admin Mode","details":"Pepr is a type safe K8s middleware. Prior to 1.0.5 , Pepr defaults to a cluster-admin RBAC configuration and does not explicitly force or enforce least-privilege guidance for module authors. The default behavior exists to make the “getting started” experience smooth: new users can experiment with Pepr and create resources dynamically without needing to pre-configure RBAC. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.5.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/defenseunicorns/pepr","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d4675a662b8602fcde7e4bf603432f2f133b1fd1"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.5"}]}}],"versions":["0.37.3","v0.1.12","v0.1.13","v0.1.14","v0.1.15","v0.1.16","v0.1.17","v0.1.18","v0.1.19","v0.1.21","v0.1.22","v0.1.23","v0.1.24","v0.1.25","v0.1.26","v0.1.27","v0.1.28","v0.1.29","v0.1.30","v0.1.31","v0.1.32","v0.1.33","v0.1.34","v0.1.35","v0.1.36","v0.1.37","v0.1.38","v0.1.39","v0.1.40","v0.1.41","v0.1.42","v0.1.43","v0.1.44","v0.1.45","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.10.2","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.12.2","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.13.2","v0.13.3","v0.13.4","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.14.2","v0.15.0","v0.16.0","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.19.0","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.10","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.2.6","v0.2.7","v0.2.8","v0.2.9","v0.20.0","v0.20.1","v0.20.2","v0.20.3","v0.21.0","v0.21.1","v0.22.0","v0.22.1","v0.22.2","v0.22.3-alpha","v0.22.4","v0.23.0","v0.23.1","v0.23.2","v0.24.0","v0.24.1","v0.25.0","v0.26.0","v0.26.1","v0.26.2","v0.27.0","v0.28.0","v0.28.1","v0.28.2","v0.28.3","v0.28.4","v0.28.5","v0.28.6","v0.28.7","v0.28.8","v0.29.0","v0.29.1","v0.29.2","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.30.0","v0.30.1","v0.30.2","v0.31.0","v0.31.1","v0.32.0","v0.32.1","v0.32.2","v0.32.3","v0.32.4","v0.32.5","v0.32.6","v0.32.7","v0.33.0","v0.34.0","v0.34.1","v0.35.0","v0.36.0","v0.37.0","v0.37.1","v0.37.2","v0.38.0","v0.38.0-rc","v0.38.1","v0.38.2","v0.38.3","v0.39.0","v0.39.1","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.40.0","v0.40.1","v0.42.0","v0.42.1","v0.42.2","v0.42.3","v0.43.0","v0.44.0","v0.45.0","v0.45.1","v0.46.0","v0.46.1","v0.46.2","v0.46.3","v0.47.0","v0.48.0","v0.48.1","v0.49.0","v0.5.0","v0.50.0","v0.51.0","v0.51.1","v0.51.2","v0.51.3","v0.51.4","v0.51.5","v0.51.6","v0.52.0","v0.52.1","v0.52.2","v0.52.3","v0.53.0","v0.53.1","v0.54.0","v0.55.0","v0.55.1","v0.55.2","v0.55.3","v0.55.4","v0.55.5","v0.55.6","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23634.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23634.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/defenseunicorns/pepr/releases/tag/v1.0.5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/defenseunicorns/pepr/security/advisories/GHSA-w54x-r83c-x79q"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23634"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-272"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23634.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N"}]}
