This could present a security risk if information-disclosure auditing processes rely on a clone operation without the --mirror option. Note: This has been disputed by multiple 3rd parties who believe this is an intended feature of the git binary and does not pose a security risk.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"git","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/git?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:2.30.2-1","1:2.30.2-1+deb11u1","1:2.30.2-1+deb11u2","1:2.30.2-1+deb11u3","1:2.30.2-1+deb11u4","1:2.31.0+next.20210315-1","1:2.31.0-1","1:2.31.0~rc2+next.20210304-1","1:2.31.0~rc2+next.20210309-1","1:2.31.1+next.20210417-1","1:2.31.1+next.20210514-1","1:2.31.1-1","1:2.32.0+next.20210606-1","1:2.32.0-1","1:2.32.0~rc0+next.20210520-1","1:2.32.0~rc0-1","1:2.32.0~rc2+next.20210531-1","1:2.32.0~rc2-1","1:2.33.0+next.20210816-1","1:2.33.0+next.20210901-1","1:2.33.0+next.20210929-1","1:2.33.0-1","1:2.33.1+next.20211025-1","1:2.33.1-1","1:2.34.0+next.20211119-1","1:2.34.0-1","1:2.34.1+next.20211124-1","1:2.34.1+next.20211202-1","1:2.34.1+next.20211221-1","1:2.34.1+next.20211227-1","1:2.34.1-1","1:2.34.1-1~bpo11+1","1:2.35.1+next.20220128-1","1:2.35.1+next.20220211-1","1:2.35.1-1","1:2.35.2-1","1:2.36.0+next.20220417-1","1:2.36.0+next.20220428-1","1:2.36.0+next.20220504-1","1:2.36.0-1","1:2.36.0~rc2+next.20220411-1","1:2.36.0~rc2+next.20220414-1","1:2.36.1+next.20220505-1","1:2.36.1-1","1:2.37.2+next.20220812-1","1:2.37.2-1","1:2.38.1+next.20221031-1","1:2.38.1-1","1:2.39.0+next.20221212-1","1:2.39.0+next.20221220-1","1:2.39.0-1","1:2.39.1-0.1","1:2.39.1-0.1~bpo11+1","1:2.39.2+next.20230215-1","1:2.39.2-1","1:2.39.2-1.1","1:2.39.2-1~bpo11+1","1:2.40.0+next.20230313-1","1:2.40.0+next.20230319-1","1:2.40.0-1","1:2.40.0-1+alpha.1","1:2.40.1+next.20230424-1","1:2.40.1+next.20230427-1","1:2.40.1-1","1:2.40.1-1+alpha.1","1:2.42.0-1","1:2.43.0+next.20231120-1","1:2.43.0+next.20240104-1","1:2.43.0-1","1:2.43.0-1+alpha.2","1:2.45.1+next.20240516-1","1:2.45.1-1","1:2.45.2+next.20240614-1","1:2.45.2-1","1:2.45.2-1+alpha.1","1:2.45.2-1.1","1:2.45.2-1.1+alpha.1","1:2.45.2-1.2","1:2.45.2-1.3","1:2.47.1-1","1:2.47.2-0.1","1:2.47.2-0.2","1:2.48.0~rc1+next.20250101-1","1:2.49.0+next.20250314-1","1:2.49.0-1","1:2.49.0-2","1:2.49.0-3","1:2.50.0+next.20250615-1","1:2.50.0-1","1:2.50.0~rc0+next.20250528-1","1:2.50.1-0.1","1:2.51.0+next.20250825-1","1:2.51.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-24975.json"}},{"package":{"name":"git","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/git?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:2.39.2+next.20230215-1","1:2.39.2-1.1","1:2.39.5-0+deb12u1","1:2.39.5-0+deb12u2","1:2.40.0+next.20230313-1","1:2.40.0+next.20230319-1","1:2.40.0-1","1:2.40.0-1+alpha.1","1:2.40.1+next.20230424-1","1:2.40.1+next.20230427-1","1:2.40.1-1","1:2.40.1-1+alpha.1","1:2.42.0-1","1:2.43.0+next.20231120-1","1:2.43.0+next.20240104-1","1:2.43.0-1","1:2.43.0-1+alpha.2","1:2.45.1+next.20240516-1","1:2.45.1-1","1:2.45.2+next.20240614-1","1:2.45.2-1","1:2.45.2-1+alpha.1","1:2.45.2-1.1","1:2.45.2-1.1+alpha.1","1:2.45.2-1.2","1:2.45.2-1.3","1:2.47.1-1","1:2.47.2-0.1","1:2.47.2-0.2","1:2.48.0~rc1+next.20250101-1","1:2.49.0+next.20250314-1","1:2.49.0-1","1:2.49.0-2","1:2.49.0-3","1:2.50.0+next.20250615-1","1:2.50.0-1","1:2.50.0~rc0+next.20250528-1","1:2.50.1-0.1","1:2.51.0+next.20250825-1","1:2.51.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-24975.json"}},{"package":{"name":"git","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/git?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:2.47.2-0.2","1:2.47.3-0+deb13u1","1:2.48.0~rc1+next.20250101-1","1:2.49.0+next.20250314-1","1:2.49.0-1","1:2.49.0-2","1:2.49.0-3","1:2.50.0+next.20250615-1","1:2.50.0-1","1:2.50.0~rc0+next.20250528-1","1:2.50.1-0.1","1:2.51.0+next.20250825-1","1:2.51.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-24975.json"}},{"package":{"name":"git","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/git?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:2.47.2-0.2","1:2.48.0~rc1+next.20250101-1","1:2.49.0+next.20250314-1","1:2.49.0-1","1:2.49.0-2","1:2.49.0-3","1:2.50.0+next.20250615-1","1:2.50.0-1","1:2.50.0~rc0+next.20250528-1","1:2.50.1-0.1","1:2.51.0+next.20250825-1","1:2.51.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-24975.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-24975"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
