The event used to signal the termination of the client connection on the avahi Unix socket is not correctly handled in the client_work function, allowing a local attacker to trigger an infinite loop. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to the availability of the avahi service, which becomes unresponsive after this flaw is triggered.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"avahi","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/avahi?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.8-r1"}]}],"versions":["0.6.28-r0","0.6.28-r1","0.6.28-r2","0.6.29-r0","0.6.30-r0","0.6.30-r1","0.6.30-r2","0.6.30-r3","0.6.30-r4","0.6.31-r0","0.6.31-r1","0.6.31-r2","0.6.31-r3","0.6.31-r4","0.6.31-r5","0.6.31-r6","0.6.31-r7","0.6.31-r8","0.6.32-r0","0.6.32-r1","0.6.32-r2","0.6.32-r3","0.6.32-r4","0.7-r0","0.7-r1","0.7-r2","0.7-r3","0.7-r4","0.7-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-3468.json"}},{"package":{"name":"avahi","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/avahi?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.8-r1"}]}],"versions":["0.6.28-r0","0.6.28-r1","0.6.28-r2","0.6.29-r0","0.6.30-r0","0.6.30-r1","0.6.30-r2","0.6.30-r3","0.6.30-r4","0.6.31-r0","0.6.31-r1","0.6.31-r2","0.6.31-r3","0.6.31-r4","0.6.31-r5","0.6.31-r6","0.6.31-r7","0.6.31-r8","0.6.32-r0","0.6.32-r1","0.6.32-r2","0.6.32-r3","0.6.32-r4","0.7-r0","0.7-r1","0.7-r2","0.7-r3","0.7-r4","0.8-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-3468.json"}},{"package":{"name":"avahi","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/avahi?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.8-r3"}]}],"versions":["0.6.28-r0","0.6.28-r1","0.6.28-r2","0.6.29-r0","0.6.30-r0","0.6.30-r1","0.6.30-r2","0.6.30-r3","0.6.30-r4","0.6.31-r0","0.6.31-r1","0.6.31-r2","0.6.31-r3","0.6.31-r4","0.6.31-r5","0.6.31-r6","0.6.31-r7","0.6.31-r8","0.6.32-r0","0.6.32-r1","0.6.32-r2","0.6.32-r3","0.6.32-r4","0.7-r0","0.7-r1","0.7-r2","0.7-r3","0.7-r4","0.8-r0","0.8-r1","0.8-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-3468.json"}},{"package":{"name":"avahi","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/avahi?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.8-r4"}]}],"versions":["0.6.28-r0","0.6.28-r1","0.6.28-r2","0.6.29-r0","0.6.30-r0","0.6.30-r1","0.6.30-r2","0.6.30-r3","0.6.30-r4","0.6.31-r0","0.6.31-r1","0.6.31-r2","0.6.31-r3","0.6.31-r4","0.6.31-r5","0.6.31-r6","0.6.31-r7","0.6.31-r8","0.6.32-r0","0.6.32-r1","0.6.32-r2","0.6.32-r3","0.6.32-r4","0.7-r0","0.7-r1","0.7-r2","0.7-r3","0.7-r4","0.8-r0","0.8-r1","0.8-r2","0.8-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-3468.json"}},{"package":{"name":"avahi","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/avahi?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.8-r4"}]}],"versions":["0.6.28-r0","0.6.28-r1","0.6.28-r2","0.6.29-r0","0.6.30-r0","0.6.30-r1","0.6.30-r2","0.6.30-r3","0.6.30-r4","0.6.31-r0","0.6.31-r1","0.6.31-r2","0.6.31-r3","0.6.31-r4","0.6.31-r5","0.6.31-r6","0.6.31-r7","0.6.31-r8","0.6.32-r0","0.6.32-r1","0.6.32-r2","0.6.32-r3","0.6.32-r4","0.7-r0","0.7-r1","0.7-r2","0.7-r3","0.7-r4","0.8-r0","0.8-r1","0.8-r2","0.8-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-3468.json"}},{"package":{"name":"avahi","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/avahi?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.8-r4"}]}],"versions":["0.6.28-r0","0.6.28-r1","0.6.28-r2","0.6.29-r0","0.6.30-r0","0.6.30-r1","0.6.30-r2","0.6.30-r3","0.6.30-r4","0.6.31-r0","0.6.31-r1","0.6.31-r2","0.6.31-r3","0.6.31-r4","0.6.31-r5","0.6.31-r6","0.6.31-r7","0.6.31-r8","0.6.32-r0","0.6.32-r1","0.6.32-r2","0.6.32-r3","0.6.32-r4","0.7-r0","0.7-r1","0.7-r2","0.7-r3","0.7-r4","0.8-r0","0.8-r1","0.8-r2","0.8-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-3468.json"}},{"package":{"name":"avahi","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/avahi?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.8-r4"}]}],"versions":["0.6.28-r0","0.6.28-r1","0.6.28-r2","0.6.29-r0","0.6.30-r0","0.6.30-r1","0.6.30-r2","0.6.30-r3","0.6.30-r4","0.6.31-r0","0.6.31-r1","0.6.31-r2","0.6.31-r3","0.6.31-r4","0.6.31-r5","0.6.31-r6","0.6.31-r7","0.6.31-r8","0.6.32-r0","0.6.32-r1","0.6.32-r2","0.6.32-r3","0.6.32-r4","0.7-r0","0.7-r1","0.7-r2","0.7-r3","0.7-r4","0.8-r0","0.8-r1","0.8-r2","0.8-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-3468.json"}},{"package":{"name":"avahi","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/avahi?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.8-r4"}]}],"versions":["0.6.28-r0","0.6.28-r1","0.6.28-r2","0.6.29-r0","0.6.30-r0","0.6.30-r1","0.6.30-r2","0.6.30-r3","0.6.30-r4","0.6.31-r0","0.6.31-r1","0.6.31-r2","0.6.31-r3","0.6.31-r4","0.6.31-r5","0.6.31-r6","0
