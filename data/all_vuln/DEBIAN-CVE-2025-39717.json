  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  open_tree_attr: do not allow id-mapping changes without OPEN_TREE_CLONE  As described in commit 7a54947e727b ('Merge patch series \"fs: allow changing idmappings\"'), open_tree_attr(2) was necessary in order to allow for a detached mount to be created and have its idmappings changed without the risk of any racing threads operating on it. For this reason, mount_setattr(2) still does not allow for id-mappings to be changed.  However, there was a bug in commit 2462651ffa76 (\"fs: allow changing idmappings\") which allowed users to bypass this restriction by calling open_tree_attr(2) *without* OPEN_TREE_CLONE.  can_idmap_mount() prevented this bug from allowing an attached mountpoint's id-mapping from being modified (thanks to an is_anon_ns() check), but this still allows for detached (but visible) mounts to have their be id-mapping changed. This risks the same UAF and locking issues as described in the merge commit, and was likely unintentional.",
