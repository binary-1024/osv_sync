[1]  Do the following steps can reproduce this BUG: mount -t ocfs2 /dev/vdc /mnt/ocfs2 cp testfile /mnt/ocfs2/ ./link-cp /mnt/ocfs2/testfile /mnt/ocfs2/testfile.1 umount /mnt/ocfs2  Then umount will fail, and it outputs: umount: /mnt/ocfs2: target is busy.  While tracing umount, it blames mnt_get_count() not return as expected. Do a deep investigation for fget()/fput() on related code flow, I've finally found that fget() leaks since ocfs2 doesn't support nowait buffered read.  io_issue_sqe |-io_assign_file  // do fget() first   |-io_read   |-io_iter_do_read     |-ocfs2_file_read_iter  // return -EOPNOTSUPP   |-kiocb_done     |-io_rw_done       |-__io_complete_rw_common  // set REQ_F_REISSUE     |-io_resubmit_prep       |-io_req_prep_async  // override req->file, leak happens  This was introduced by commit a196c78b5443 in v5.18. Fix it by don't re-assign req->file if it has already been assigned.
