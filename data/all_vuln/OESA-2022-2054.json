  "details": "HAProxy is a free, very fast and reliable solution offering high availability, load balancing, and proxying for TCP and HTTP-based applications. It is particularly suited for very high traffic web sites and powers quite a number of the world's most visited ones. \r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the way HAProxy processed HTTP responses containing the &quot;Set-Cookie2&quot; header. This flaw could allow an attacker to send crafted HTTP response packets which lead to an infinite loop, eventually resulting in a denial of service condition. The highest threat from this vulnerability is availability.(CVE-2022-0711)",
