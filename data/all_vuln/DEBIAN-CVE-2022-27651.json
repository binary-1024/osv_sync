A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, enabling an attacker with access to programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set when execve(2) runs. This has the potential to impact confidentiality and integrity.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"golang-github-containers-buildah","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-containers-buildah?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.19.6+dfsg1-1","1.20.0+ds1-1","1.20.1+ds1-1","1.20.1+ds1-2","1.21.0+ds1-2","1.21.3+ds1-1","1.22.3+ds1-1","1.22.3+ds1-2","1.23.1+ds1-1","1.23.1+ds1-2","1.23.1+ds1-3","1.24.1+ds1-1","1.26.1+ds1-1","1.27.0+ds1-2","1.27.0+ds1-3","1.27.0+ds1-4","1.27.0+ds1-5","1.27.0+ds1-6","1.28.0+ds1-1","1.28.0+ds1-2","1.28.0+ds1-3","1.28.2+ds1-1","1.28.2+ds1-2","1.28.2+ds1-3","1.29.0+ds1-1","1.30.0+ds1-1","1.30.0+ds1-2","1.30.0+ds1-3","1.31.2+ds1-1","1.31.2+ds1-2","1.31.2+ds1-3","1.32.0+ds1-1","1.32.0+ds1-2","1.32.2+ds1-1","1.33.1+ds1-1","1.33.1+ds1-2","1.33.3+ds1-1","1.33.3+ds1-2","1.33.5+ds1-3","1.33.5+ds1-4","1.33.7+ds1-1","1.34.0+ds1-1","1.34.0+ds1-2","1.35.3+ds1-1","1.35.3+ds1-2","1.35.3+ds1-3","1.37.0+ds1-1","1.37.1+ds1-1","1.37.1+ds1-2","1.37.2+ds1-1","1.37.2+ds1-2","1.37.2+ds1-3","1.37.3+ds1-1","1.37.3+ds1-2","1.37.3+ds1-3","1.37.4+ds1-1","1.37.5+ds1-1","1.38.0+ds1-1","1.38.0+ds1-2","1.38.1+ds1-1","1.39.0+ds1-1","1.39.3+ds1-1","1.41.4+ds1-1","1.41.4+ds1-2","1.41.4+ds1-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-27651.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-containers-buildah","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-containers-buildah?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.28.0+ds1-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-27651.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-containers-buildah","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-containers-buildah?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.28.0+ds1-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-27651.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-containers-buildah","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-containers-buildah?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.28.0+ds1-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-27651.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-27651"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
