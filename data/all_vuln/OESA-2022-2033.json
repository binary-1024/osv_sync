VDB-211018 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.(CVE-2022-3521)\n\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel\u2019s networking code. A use-after-free was found in the way the sch_sfb enqueue function used the socket buffer (SKB) cb field after the same SKB had been enqueued (and freed) into a child qdisc. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to crash the system, causing a denial of service.(CVE-2022-3586)\n\nVUL-0: CVE-2022-2602: kernel: defer registered files gc to io_uring release(CVE-2022-2602)\n\nA vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in Linux Kernel. Affected is the function j1939_session_destroy of the file net/can/j1939/transport.c of the component IPsec. The manipulation leads to memory leak. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211932.(CVE-2022-3633)\n\nAn out-of-bounds memory write flaw was found in the Linux kernel\u2019s Kid-friendly Wired Controller driver. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. It is in bigben_probe of drivers/hid/hid-bigbenff.c. The reason is incorrect assumption - bigben devices all have inputs. However, malicious devices can break this assumption, leaking to out-of-bound write.(CVE-2022-3577)",
