  "details": "NATS-Server is a High-Performance server for NATS.io, the cloud and edge native messaging system. In versions starting from 2.2.0 but prior to 2.10.27 and 2.11.1, the management of JetStream assets happens with messages in the $JS. subject namespace in the system account; this is partially exposed into regular accounts to allow account holders to manage their assets. Some of the JS API requests were missing access controls, allowing any user with JS management permissions in any account to perform certain administrative actions on any JS asset in any other account. At least one of the unprotected APIs allows for data destruction. None of the affected APIs allow disclosing stream contents. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.11.1 or v2.10.27.",
