{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-40326","published":"2025-12-08T01:16:05.337Z","modified":"2025-12-08T11:06:23.422410Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-40326"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFSD: Define actions for the new time_deleg FATTR4 attributes  NFSv4 clients won't send legitimate GETATTR requests for these new attributes because they are intended to be used only with CB_GETATTR and SETATTR. But NFSD has to do something besides crashing if it ever sees a GETATTR request that queries these attributes.  RFC 8881 Section 18.7.3 states:  > The server MUST return a value for each attribute that the client > requests if the attribute is supported by the server for the > target file system. If the server does not support a particular > attribute on the target file system, then it MUST NOT return the > attribute value and MUST NOT set the attribute bit in the result > bitmap. The server MUST return an error if it supports an > attribute on the target but cannot obtain its value. In that case, > no attribute values will be returned.  Further, RFC 9754 Section 5 states:  > These new attributes are invalid to be used with GETATTR, VERIFY, > and NVERIFY, and they can only be used with CB_GETATTR and SETATTR > by a client holding an appropriate delegation.  Thus there does not appear to be a specific server response mandated by specification. Taking the guidance that querying these attributes via GETATTR is \"invalid\", NFSD will return nfserr_inval, failing the request entirely.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.17.8-1"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.57-1","6.12.57-1~bpo12+1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.10-1","6.16.11-1","6.16.12-1","6.16.12-1~bpo13+1","6.16.12-2","6.16.3-1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16.5-1","6.16.6-1","6.16.7-1","6.16.8-1","6.16.9-1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1","6.17.2-1~exp1","6.17.5-1~exp1","6.17.6-1","6.17.7-1","6.17.7-2","6.17.8-1~bpo13+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-40326.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-40326"}]}
