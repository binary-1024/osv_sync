Prior to 1.4.2 and 2.4.1, a missing ownership check allowed an attack to take-away a 2FA webauthn device when correctly guessing a 80-128 character long random string of letters, numbers and symbols. The victim would then be prompted to register a new device on the next login. The attacker can not authenticate as the victim. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.2 and 2.4.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/twofactor_webauthn","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5d2302166d31ee2e01b2e21556bd5372156da13d"}]}],"versions":["v0.3.1","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.4.0-rc.1","v1.4.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66558.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66558.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-fr8x-mvjg-wf9q"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/twofactor_webauthn/commit/5d2302166d31ee2e01b2e21556bd5372156da13d"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/twofactor_webauthn/pull/881"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/3360354"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66558"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-639"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66558.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
