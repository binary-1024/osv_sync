This only affects use of the --extra-index-url option, and exploitation requires that the package does not already exist in the public index (and thus the attacker can put the package there with an arbitrary version number). NOTE: it has been reported that this is intended functionality and the user is responsible for using --extra-index-url securely","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-pip","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-pip?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["20.3.4-4","20.3.4-4+deb11u1","21.3.1+dfsg-1","21.3.1+dfsg-2","21.3.1+dfsg-3","22.0.2+dfsg-1","22.1+dfsg-1","22.1.1+dfsg-1","22.2+dfsg-1","22.3+dfsg-1","22.3.1+dfsg-1","22.3.1+dfsg-2","23.0+dfsg-1","23.0+dfsg-2","23.0.1+dfsg-1","23.1.2+dfsg-1","23.1.2+dfsg-2","23.2+dfsg-1","23.2.1+dfsg-1","23.3+dfsg-1","24.0+dfsg-1","24.0+dfsg-2","24.1+dfsg-1","24.1.1+dfsg-1","24.2+dfsg-1","24.3.1+dfsg-1","25.0+dfsg-1","25.0.1+dfsg-1","25.1+dfsg-1","25.1.1+dfsg-1","25.2+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-20225.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-pip","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-pip?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["23.0.1+dfsg-1","23.1.2+dfsg-1","23.1.2+dfsg-2","23.2+dfsg-1","23.2.1+dfsg-1","23.3+dfsg-1","24.0+dfsg-1","24.0+dfsg-2","24.1+dfsg-1","24.1.1+dfsg-1","24.2+dfsg-1","24.3.1+dfsg-1","25.0+dfsg-1","25.0.1+dfsg-1","25.1+dfsg-1","25.1.1+dfsg-1","25.2+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-20225.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-pip","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-pip?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["25.1.1+dfsg-1","25.2+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-20225.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-pip","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-pip?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["25.1.1+dfsg-1","25.2+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-20225.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20225"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
