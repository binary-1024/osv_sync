  "summary": "Updated apache packages fix security vulnerability",
  "details": "mod_sessioncrypto was encrypting its data/cookie using the configured ciphers\nwith possibly either CBC or ECB modes of operation (AES256-CBC by default),\nhence no selectable or builtin authenticated encryption. This made it\nvulnerable to padding oracle attacks, particularly with CBC (CVE-2016-0736).\n\nMalicious input to mod_auth_digest will cause the server to crash, and each\ninstance continues to crash even for subsequently valid requests\n(CVE-2016-2161).\n\nEmmanuel Dreyfus reported that the use of ap_get_basic_auth_pw() by third-party\nmodules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication\nrequirements being bypassed (CVE-2017-3167).\n\nVasileios Panopoulos of AdNovum Informatik AG discovered that mod_ssl may\ndereference a NULL pointer when third-party modules call\nap_hook_process_connection() during an HTTP request to an HTTPS port leading to\na denial of service (CVE-2017-3169).\n\nJavier Jimenez reported that the HTTP strict parsing contains a flaw leading to\na buffer overread in ap_find_token(). A remote attacker can take advantage of\nthis flaw by carefully crafting a sequence of request headers to cause a\nsegmentation fault, or to force ap_find_token() to return an incorrect value\n(CVE-2017-7668).\n\nChenQin and Hanno Boeck reported that mod_mime can read one byte past the end of\na buffer when sending a malicious Content-Type response header (CVE-2017-7679).\n\nRobert Swiecki reported that mod_auth_digest does not properly initialize or\nreset the value placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type \"Digest\"\nbetween successive key=value assignments, leading to information disclosure or\ndenial of service (CVE-2017-9788).\n\nHanno B\u00f6ck discovered that the Apache HTTP Server incorrectly handled Limit\ndirectives in .htaccess files. In certain configurations, a remote attacker\ncould possibly use this issue to read arbitrary server memory, including\nsensitive information. This issue is known as Optionsbleed (CVE-2017-9798).\n",
