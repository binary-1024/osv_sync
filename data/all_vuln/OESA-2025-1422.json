  "details": "Mozilla Firefox is a standalone web browser, designed for standards compliance and performance.  Its functionality can be enhanced via a plethora of extensions.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nIf an attacker loaded a font using &lt;code&gt;FontFace()&lt;/code&gt; on a background worker, a use-after-free could have occurred, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 107.(CVE-2022-45407)\n\nWhen downloading an HTML file, if the title of the page was formatted as a filename with a malicious extension, Firefox may have saved the file with that extension, leading to possible system compromise if the downloaded file was later ran. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 107.(CVE-2022-45415)\n\nBecause Firefox did not implement the &lt;code&gt;unsafe-hashes&lt;/code&gt; CSP directive, an attacker who was able to inject markup into a page otherwise protected by a Content Security Policy may have been able to inject executable script. This would be severely constrained by the specified Content Security Policy of the document. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 108.(CVE-2022-46873)\n\nMozilla developers Timothy Nikkel, Ashley Hale, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 105. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 106.(CVE-2022-46885)",
