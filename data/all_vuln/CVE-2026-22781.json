TinyWeb HTTP Server before version 1.98 is vulnerable to OS command injection via CGI ISINDEX-style query parameters. The query parameters are passed as command-line arguments to the CGI executable via Windows CreateProcess(). An unauthenticated remote attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server by injecting Windows shell metacharacters into HTTP requests.
