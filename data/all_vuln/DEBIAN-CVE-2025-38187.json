When sending the initial fragment of a large RPC and passing the caller's RPC container, the container will be freed prematurely. Subsequent attempts to send remaining fragments will therefore result in a use-after-free.  Allocate a temporary RPC container for holding the initial fragment of a large RPC when sending. Free the caller's container when all fragments are successfully sent.
