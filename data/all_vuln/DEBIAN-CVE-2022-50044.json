It may leads to 2 race conditions issues.  1) Such event may be dropped by qcom_mhi_qrtr_dl_callback() at check:  \tif (!qdev || mhi_res->transaction_status) \t\treturn;  Because dev_set_drvdata(&mhi_dev->dev, qdev) may be not performed at this moment. In this situation qrtr-ns will be unable to enumerate services in device. ---------------------------------------------------------------  2) Such event may come at the moment after dev_set_drvdata() and before qrtr_endpoint_register(). In this case kernel will panic with accessing wrong pointer at qcom_mhi_qrtr_dl_callback():  \trc = qrtr_endpoint_post(&qdev->ep, mhi_res->buf_addr, \t\t\t\tmhi_res->bytes_xferd);  Because endpoint is not created yet. -------------------------------------------------------------- So move mhi_prepare_for_transfer_autoqueue after endpoint creation to fix it.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50044.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50044.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50044.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-50044"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
