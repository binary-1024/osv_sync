{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68171","published":"2025-12-16T14:15:48.980Z","modified":"2026-01-10T14:07:46.328743Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-68171"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/fpu: Ensure XFD state on signal delivery  Sean reported [1] the following splat when running KVM tests:     WARNING: CPU: 232 PID: 15391 at xfd_validate_state+0x65/0x70    Call Trace:     <TASK>     fpu__clear_user_states+0x9c/0x100     arch_do_signal_or_restart+0x142/0x210     exit_to_user_mode_loop+0x55/0x100     do_syscall_64+0x205/0x2c0     entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53  Chao further identified [2] a reproducible scenario involving signal delivery: a non-AMX task is preempted by an AMX-enabled task which modifies the XFD MSR.  When the non-AMX task resumes and reloads XSTATE with init values, a warning is triggered due to a mismatch between fpstate::xfd and the CPU's current XFD state. fpu__clear_user_states() does not currently re-synchronize the XFD state after such preemption.  Invoke xfd_update_state() which detects and corrects the mismatch if there is a dynamic feature.  This also benefits the sigreturn path, as fpu__restore_sig() may call fpu__clear_user_states() when the sigframe is inaccessible.
