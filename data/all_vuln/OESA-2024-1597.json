This issue can be triggered when a device frozen by a sync grab is reattached to a different master device. This issue may lead to an application crash, local privilege escalation (if the server runs with extended privileges), or remote code execution in SSH X11 forwarding environments.(CVE-2024-0229)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the X.Org server. The cursor code in both Xephyr and Xwayland uses the wrong type of private at creation. It uses the cursor bits type with the cursor as private, and when initiating the cursor, that overwrites the XSELINUX context.(CVE-2024-0409)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"xorg-x11-server-xwayland","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/xorg-x11-server-xwayland&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"xorg-x11-server-Xwayland-22.1.2-5.oe2203sp2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["xorg-x11-server-Xwayland-22.1.2-5.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","xorg-x11-server-Xwayland-debugsource-22.1.2-5.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","xorg-x11-server-Xwayland-devel-22.1.2-5.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","xorg-x11-server-Xwayland-debuginfo-22.1.2-5.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["xorg-x11-server-Xwayland-22.1.2-5.oe2203sp2.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["xorg-x11-server-Xwayland-22.1.2-5.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","xorg-x11-server-Xwayland-debuginfo-22.1.2-5.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","xorg-x11-server-Xwayland-debugsource-22.1.2-5.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","xorg-x11-server-Xwayland-devel-22.1.2-5.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-1597.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2024-1597"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0229"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0409"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
