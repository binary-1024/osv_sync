Versions 7.10.0 until 8.0.2 are vulnerable to arbitrary code execution in environments consuming generated clients. This issue is similar in nature to CVE-2026-22785, but affects a different code path in @orval/core that was not addressed by CVE-2026-22785's fix. The vulnerability allows untrusted OpenAPI specifications to inject arbitrary TypeScript/JavaScript code into generated clients via the x-enumDescriptions field, which is embedded without proper escaping in getEnumImplementation(). I have confirmed that the injection occurs during const enum generation and results in executable code within the generated schema files. Orval 8.0.2 contains a fix for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/orval-labs/orval","events":[{"introduced":"e62b7ab51212d7314b116be335d64aef38218328"},{"fixed":"200f7dbbc59e4e84286ccf2cbeb9fed515f98bab"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"7.10.0"},{"fixed":"8.0.2"}]}}],"versions":["v7.10.0","v7.11.0","v7.11.1","v7.11.2","v7.12.0","v7.12.1","v7.12.2","v7.13.0","v7.13.1","v7.13.2","v7.14.0","v7.15.0","v8.0.0","v8.0.0-rc.0","v8.0.0-rc.1","v8.0.0-rc.2","v8.0.0-rc.3","v8.0.0-rc.4","v8.0.0-rc.5","v8.0.0-rc.6","v8.0.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23947.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23947.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/orval-labs/orval/releases/tag/v8.0.2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/orval-labs/orval/security/advisories/GHSA-h526-wf6g-67jv"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23947"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-77"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23947.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
