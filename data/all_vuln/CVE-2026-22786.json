{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-22786","published":"2026-01-12T21:09:01.732Z","modified":"2026-01-13T20:11:39.357358Z","aliases":["GHSA-3558-j79f-vvm6"],"summary":"The arbitrary file upload vulnerability caused by path traversal is on github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin","details":"Gin-vue-admin is a backstage management system based on vue and gin. Gin-vue-admin <= v2.8.7 has a path traversal vulnerability in the breakpoint resume upload functionality. Attacker can upload any files on any directory. In the breakpoint_continue.go file, the MakeFile function accepts a fileName parameter through the /fileUploadAndDownload/breakpointContinueFinish API endpoint and directly concatenates it with the base directory path (./fileDir/) using os.OpenFile() without any validation for directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../). An attacker with file upload privileges could exploit this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"805f3195784c4e13de826b6f4cbff25d3bf3724b"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"2.8.7"}]}}],"versions":["V2.3.1","V2.3.7","V2.4.4","V2.5.0b","v.2.3.41","v0.9.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.1.0","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.3.3","v2.3.31","v2.3.4","v2.3.5","v2.3.6","v2.3.8","v2.3.9","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.2","v2.4.3","v2.4.4","v2.4.4-1","v2.4.5","v2.4.5Beta","v2.4.5RC","v2.4.6","v2.5.0","v2.5.0a","v2.5.1","v2.5.1b","v2.5.2","v2.5.3","v2.5.3b","v2.5.3beta","v2.5.4","v2.5.5","v2.5.6","v2.5.6-a","v2.5.7","v2.5.7-a","v2.5.8","v2.5.9","v2.5.9a","v2.6.0","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.6.3","v2.6.4","v2.6.4-a","v2.6.5","v2.6.6","v2.6.7","v2.7.0","v2.7.1","v2.7.2","v2.7.3","v2.7.4","v2.7.5","v2.7.6","v2.7.7","v2.7.9","v2.8.0","v2.8.1","v2.8.2","v2.8.2-a","v2.8.3","v2.8.4","v2.8.5","v2.8.6","v2.8.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22786.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22786.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin/commit/2242f5d6e133e96d1b359ac019bf54fa0e975dd5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin/security/advisories/GHSA-3558-j79f-vvm6"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22786"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-22","CWE-434"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22786.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
