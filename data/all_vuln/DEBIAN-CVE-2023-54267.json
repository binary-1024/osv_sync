{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-54267","published":"2025-12-30T13:16:15.517Z","modified":"2025-12-31T11:10:33.596811Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-54267"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/pseries: Rework lppaca_shared_proc() to avoid DEBUG_PREEMPT  lppaca_shared_proc() takes a pointer to the lppaca which is typically accessed through get_lppaca().  With DEBUG_PREEMPT enabled, this leads to checking if preemption is enabled, for example:    BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: grep/10693   caller is lparcfg_data+0x408/0x19a0   CPU: 4 PID: 10693 Comm: grep Not tainted 6.5.0-rc3 #2   Call Trace:     dump_stack_lvl+0x154/0x200 (unreliable)     check_preemption_disabled+0x214/0x220     lparcfg_data+0x408/0x19a0     ...  This isn't actually a problem however, as it does not matter which lppaca is accessed, the shared proc state will be the same. vcpudispatch_stats_procfs_init() already works around this by disabling preemption, but the lparcfg code does not, erroring any time /proc/powerpc/lparcfg is accessed with DEBUG_PREEMPT enabled.  Instead of disabling preemption on the caller side, rework lppaca_shared_proc() to not take a pointer and instead directly access the lppaca, bypassing any potential preemption checks.
