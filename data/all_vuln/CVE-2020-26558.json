The attack methodology determines the Passkey value one bit at a time.","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/799380"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/06/msg00019.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/06/msg00020.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/06/msg00022.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-16"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/key-attributes/bluetooth-security/reporting-security/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4951"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00517.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00520.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NSS6CTGE4UGTJLCOZOASDR3T3SLL6QJZ/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
