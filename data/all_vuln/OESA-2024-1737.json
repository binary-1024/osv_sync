This can then be\nused to decide whether to use FS.FetchData or FS.FetchData64 - and also\nFS.StoreData or FS.StoreData64 - rather than using upper_32_bits() to\nswitch on the parameter values.\r\n\r\nThis capabilities flag could also be used to limit the maximum size of the\nfile, but all servers must be checked for that.\r\n\r\nNote that the issue does not exist with FS.StoreData - that uses *unsigned*\n32-bit values.  It&apos;s also not a problem with Auristor servers as its\nYFS.FetchData64 op uses unsigned 64-bit values.\r\n\r\nThis can be tested by cloning a git repo through an OpenAFS client to an\nOpenAFS server and then doing &quot;git status&quot; on it from a Linux afs\nclient[1].  Provided the clone has a pack file that&apos;s in the 2G-4G range,\nthe git status will show errors like:\r\n\r\n\terror: packfile .git/objects/pack/pack-5e813c51d12b6847bbc0fcd97c2bca66da50079c.pack does not match index\n\terror: packfile .git/objects/pack/pack-5e813c51d12b6847bbc0fcd97c2bca66da50079c.pack does not match index\r\n\r\nThis can be observed in the server&apos;s FileLog with something like the\nfollowing appearing:\r\n\r\nSun Aug 29 19:31:39 2021 SRXAFS_FetchData, Fid = 2303380852.491776.3263114, Host 192.168.11.201:7001, Id 1001\nSun Aug 29 19:31:39 2021 CheckRights: len=0, for host=192.168.11.201:7001\nSun Aug 29 19:31:39 2021 FetchData_RXStyle: Pos 18446744071815340032, Len 3154\nSun Aug 29 19:31:39 2021 FetchData_RXStyle: file size 2400758866\n...\nSun Aug 29 19:31:40 2021 SRXAFS_FetchData returns 5\r\n\r\nNote the file position of 18446744071815340032.

This could cause, amongst other bad\npossibilities, swap_page_trans_huge_swapped() (called by\nfree_swap_and_cache()) to access the freed memory for swap_map.\r\n\r\nThis is a theoretical problem and I haven&apos;t been able to provoke it from a\ntest case.  But there has been agreement based on code review that this is\npossible (see link below).\r\n\r\nFix it by using get_swap_device()/put_swap_device(), which will stall\nswapoff().  There was an extra check in _swap_info_get() to confirm that\nthe swap entry was not free.  This isn&apos;t present in get_swap_device()\nbecause it doesn&apos;t make sense in general due to the race between getting\nthe reference and swapoff.  So I&apos;ve added an equivalent check directly in\nfree_swap_and_cache().\r\n\r\nDetails of how to provoke one possible issue (thanks to David Hildenbrand\nfor deriving this):\r\n\r\n--8&lt;-----\r\n\r\n__swap_entry_free() might be the last user and result in\n&quot;count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE&quot;.\r\n\r\nswapoff-&gt;try_to_unuse() will stop as soon as soon as si-&gt;inuse_pages==0.\r\n\r\nSo the question is: could someone reclaim the folio and turn\nsi-&gt;inuse_pages==0, before we completed swap_page_trans_huge_swapped().\r\n\r\nImagine the following: 2 MiB folio in the swapcache. Only 2 subpages are\nstill references by swap entries.\r\n\r\nProcess 1 still references subpage 0 via swap entry.\nProcess 2 still references subpage 1 via swap entry.\r\n\r\nProcess 1 quits.

Where original skb&apos;s skb-&gt;dev can be different to neigh&apos;s\nneigh-&gt;dev. For instance in case of bridging dnated skb from one veth to\nanother, the skb would be added to a neigh-&gt;arp_queue of the bridge.\r\n\r\nAs skb-&gt;dev can be reset back to nf_bridge-&gt;physindev and used, and as\nthere is no explicit mechanism that prevents this physindev from been\nfreed under us (for instance neigh_flush_dev doesn&apos;t cleanup skbs from\ndifferent device&apos;s neigh queue) we can crash on e.g. this stack:\r\n\r\narp_process\n  neigh_update\n    skb = __skb_dequeue(&amp;neigh-&gt;arp_queue)\n      neigh_resolve_output(..., skb)\n        ...\n          br_nf_dev_xmit\n            br_nf_pre_routing_finish_bridge_slow\n              skb-&gt;dev = nf_bridge-&gt;physindev\n              br_handle_frame_finish\r\n\r\nLet&apos;s use plain ifindex instead of net_device link.

the timers.\r\n\r\ninet_csk_clear_xmit_timers() can be called from any context,\nincluding when socket lock is held.\nThis is the reason it uses sk_stop_timer(), aka del_timer().\nThis means that ongoing timers might finish much later.\r\n\r\nFor user sockets, this is fine because each running timer\nholds a reference on the socket, and the user socket holds\na reference on the netns.\r\n\r\nFor kernel sockets, we risk that the netns is freed before\ntimer can complete, because kernel sockets do not hold\nreference on the netns.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds inet_csk_clear_xmit_timers_sync() function\nthat using sk_stop_timer_sync() to make sure all timers\nare terminated before the kernel socket is released.\nModules using kernel sockets close them in their netns exit()\nhandler.\r\n\r\nAlso add sock_not_owned_by_me() helper to get LOCKDEP\nsupport : inet_csk_clear_xmit_timers_sync() must not be called\nwhile socket lock is held.\r\n\r\nIt is very possible we can revert in the future commit\n3a58f13a881e (&quot;net: rds: acquire refcount on TCP sockets&quot;)\nwhich attempted to solve the issue in rds only.\n(net/smc/af_smc.c and net/mptcp/subflow.c have similar code)\r\n\r\nWe probably can remove the check_net() tests from\ntcp_out_of_resources() and __tcp_close() in the future.(CVE-2024-35910)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\ndrm/vc4: don&apos;t check if plane-&gt;state-&gt;fb == state-&gt;fb\r\n\r\nCurrently, when using non-blocking commits, we can see the following\nkernel warning:\r\n\r\n[  110.908514] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[  110.908529] refcount_t: underflow;

This\ncan for example happen when the usable space is 110 bytes and 11 VLANs are\non top of batman-adv. In this case, at least 116 byte would be needed.\nThere will just be an endless spam of\r\n\r\n   batman_adv: batadv0: Forced to purge local tt entries to fit new maximum fragment MTU (110)\r\n\r\nin the log but the function will never finish. Problem here is that the\ntimeout will be halved all the time and will then stagnate at 0 and\ntherefore never be able to reduce the table even more.\r\n\r\nThere are other scenarios possible with a similar result. The number of\nBATADV_TT_CLIENT_NOPURGE entries in the local TT can for example be too\nhigh to fit inside a packet. Such a scenario can therefore happen also with\nonly a single VLAN + 7 non-purgable addresses - requiring at least 120\nbytes.\r\n\r\nWhile this should be handled proactively when:\r\n\r\n* interface with too low MTU is added\n* VLAN is added\n* non-purgeable local mac is added\n* MTU of an attached interface is reduced\n* fragmentation setting gets disabled (which most likely requires dropping\n  attached interfaces)\r\n\r\nnot all of these scenarios can be prevented because batman-adv is only\nconsuming events without the the possibility to prevent these actions\n(non-purgable MAC address added, MTU of an attached interface is reduced).\nIt is therefore necessary to also make sure that the code is able to handle\nalso the situations when there were already incompatible system\nconfiguration are present.(CVE-2024-35982)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\ntty: n_gsm: fix possible out-of-bounds in gsm0_receive()\r\n\r\nAssuming the following:\n- side A configures the n_gsm in basic option mode\n- side B sends the header of a basic option mode frame with data length 1\n- side A switches to advanced option mode\n- side B sends 2 data bytes which exceeds gsm-&gt;len\n  Reason: gsm-&gt;len is not used in advanced option mode.\n- side A switches to basic option mode\n- side B keeps sending until gsm0_receive() writes past gsm-&gt;buf\n  Reason: Neither gsm-&gt;state nor gsm-&gt;len have been reset after\n  reconfiguration.\r\n\r\nFix this by changing gsm-&gt;count to gsm-&gt;len comparison from equal to less\nthan.

This occurs when a vport is\nunregistered before the Remove All DA_ID CT and LOGO ELS are sent to the\nfabric.\r\n\r\nCurrently fc_remove_host(), which calls dev_loss_tmo for all D_IDs including\nthe fabric D_ID, removes the last ndlp reference and frees the ndlp rport\nobject.  This sometimes causes the race condition where the final DA_ID and\nLOGO are skipped from being sent to the fabric switch.\r\n\r\nFix by moving the fc_remove_host() and scsi_remove_host() calls after DA_ID\nand LOGO are sent.(CVE-2024-36952)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\ntipc: fix a possible memleak in tipc_buf_append\r\n\r\n__skb_linearize()

sk_dst_reset(sk) is implementing this protocol correctly,\nwhile __dst_negative_advice() uses the wrong order.\r\n\r\nGiven that ip6_negative_advice() has special logic\nagainst RTF_CACHE, this means each of the three -&gt;negative_advice()\nexisting methods must perform the sk_dst_reset() themselves.\r\n\r\nNote the check against NULL dst is centralized in\n__dst_negative_advice(), there is no
