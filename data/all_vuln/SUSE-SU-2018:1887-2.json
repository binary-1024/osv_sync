This caused the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time\n  generating a key for this prime resulting in a hang until the client has\n  finished. This could be exploited in a Denial Of Service attack (bsc#1097158).\n- Blinding enhancements for ECDSA and DSA (bsc#1097624, bsc#1098592)\n",
