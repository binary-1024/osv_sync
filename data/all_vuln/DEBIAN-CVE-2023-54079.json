{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-54079","published":"2025-12-24T13:16:09.750Z","modified":"2025-12-25T11:15:02.050719Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-54079"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  power: supply: bq27xxx: Fix poll_interval handling and races on remove  Before this patch bq27xxx_battery_teardown() was setting poll_interval = 0 to avoid bq27xxx_battery_update() requeuing the delayed_work item.  There are 2 problems with this:  1. If the driver is unbound through sysfs, rather then the module being    rmmod-ed, this changes poll_interval unexpectedly  2. This is racy, after it being set poll_interval could be changed    before bq27xxx_battery_update() checks it through    /sys/module/bq27xxx_battery/parameters/poll_interval  Fix this by added a removed attribute to struct bq27xxx_device_info and using that instead of setting poll_interval to 0.  There also is another poll_interval related race on remove(), writing /sys/module/bq27xxx_battery/parameters/poll_interval will requeue the delayed_work item for all devices on the bq27xxx_battery_devices list and the device being removed was only removed from that list after cancelling the delayed_work item.  Fix this by moving the removal from the bq27xxx_battery_devices list to before cancelling the delayed_work item.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.191-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.103-1","5.10.103-1~bpo10+1","5.10.106-1","5.10.113-1","5.10.120-1","5.10.120-1~bpo10+1","5.10.127-1","5.10.127-2","5.10.127-2~bpo10+1","5.10.136-1","5.10.140-1","5.10.148-1","5.10.149-1","5.10.149-2","5.10.158-1","5.10.158-2","5.10.162-1","5.10.178-1","5.10.178-2","5.10.178-3","5.10.179-1","5.10.179-2","5.10.179-3","5.10.179-4","5.10.179-5","5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1","5.10.92-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-54079.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.37-1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.27-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-54079.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.3.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-54079.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.3.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-54079.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-54079"}]}
