{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-24002","published":"2026-01-22T02:26:28.765Z","modified":"2026-01-22T19:56:20.789122Z","aliases":["GHSA-7xvx-8pf2-pv5g"],"summary":"pyodide sandbox option is insecure","details":"Grist is spreadsheet software using Python as its formula language. Grist offers several methods for running those formulas in a sandbox, for cases where the user may be working with untrusted spreadsheets. One such method runs them in pyodide, but pyodide on node does not have a useful sandbox barrier. If a user of Grist sets `GRIST_SANDBOX_FLAVOR` to `pyodide` and opens a malicious document, that document could run arbitrary processes on the server hosting Grist. The problem has been addressed in Grist version 1.7.9 and up, by running pyodide under deno. As a workaround, a user can use the gvisor-based sandbox by setting  `GRIST_SANDBOX_FLAVOR` to `gvisor`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"71c7e1e5132d934ab96bef8feb63b53d6507c7a3"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.7.9"}]}}],"versions":["1.3.1","1.3.2","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.4","v0.7.5","v0.7.6","v0.7.7","v0.7.8","v0.7.9","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v1.0.7","v1.0.8","v1.0.9","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.10","v1.1.11","v1.1.12","v1.1.13","v1.1.14","v1.1.15","v1.1.16","v1.1.17","v1.1.18","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.1.7","v1.1.8","v1.1.9","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.7.4","v1.7.5","v1.7.7","v1.7.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24002.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24002.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/security/advisories/GHSA-7xvx-8pf2-pv5g"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24002"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://support.getgrist.com/self-managed/#how-do-i-sandbox-documents"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-74"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24002.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
