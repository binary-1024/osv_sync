  "details": "Under certain circumstances, asynchronous functions could have caused a\nnavigation to fail but expose the target URL (CVE-2021-43536).\n\nAn incorrect type conversion of sizes from 64bit to 32bit integers allowed an\nattacker to corrupt memory leading to a potentially exploitable crash due to a\nheap buffer overflow when using structured clone (CVE-2021-43537).\n\nBy misusing a race in our notification code, an attacker could have forcefully\nhidden the notification for pages that had received both full screen and\npointer lock access, which could have been used for spoofing attacks\n(CVE-2021-43538).\n\nFailure to correctly record the location of live pointers across wasm instance\ncalls resulted in a GC occurring within the call not tracing those live\npointers. This could have led to a use-after-free causing a potentially\nexploitable crash (CVE-2021-43539).\n\nWhen invoking protocol handlers for external protocols, a supplied parameter \nURL containing spaces was not properly escaped (CVE-2021-43541).             \n\nUsing XMLHttpRequest, an attacker could have identified installed applications\nby probing error messages for loading external protocols (CVE-2021-43542).     \n\nDocuments loaded with the CSP sandbox directive could have escaped the\nsandbox's script restriction by embedding additional content (CVE-2021-43543).\n\nUsing the Location API in a loop could have caused severe application hangs\nand crashes (CVE-2021-43545).\n\nIt was possible to recreate previous cursor spoofing attacks against users\nwith a zoomed native cursor (CVE-2021-43546).\n\nMozilla developers and community members Julian Hector, Randell Jesup,\nGabriele Svelto, Tyson Smith, Christian Holler, and Masayuki Nakano reported\nmemory safety bugs present in Firefox ESR 91.3. Some of these bugs showed\nevidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of\nthese could have been exploited to run arbitrary code (CVE-2021-4129).\n",
