If tests are looking for security vulnerabilities, these were compromised.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade to `v1.2.1`\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers who don't use eye.js for looking for vulnerabilities are safe. Upgrading will just fix some bugs.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [EyeJS](https://github.com/arguiot/EyeJS)\n* Email us at [arguiot@gmail.com](mailto:arguiot@gmail.com)\n\n",
