This needs to be done before the call to notify_cpu_starting() which tells the scheduler about each cpu found, otherwise the core scheduling data structures are setup in a way that does not match the actual topology.  With smt_mask not setup correctly we bail on `cpumask_weight(smt_mask) == 1` for !leaders in:   notify_cpu_starting()    cpuhp_invoke_callback_range()      sched_cpu_starting()        sched_core_cpu_starting()  which leads to rq->core not being correctly set for !leader-rq's.  Without this change stress-ng (which enables core scheduling in its prctl tests in newer versions -- i.e. with PR_SCHED_CORE support) causes a warning and then a crash (trimmed for legibility):  [ 1853.805168] ------------[ cut here ]------------ [ 1853.809784] task_rq(b)->core != rq->core [ 1853.809792] WARNING: CPU: 117 PID: 0 at kernel/sched/fair.c:11102 cfs_prio_less+0x1b4/0x1c4 ...
