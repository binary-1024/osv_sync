  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: phy: mscc: Fix memory leak when using one step timestamping\n\nFix memory leak when running one-step timestamping. When running\none-step sync timestamping, the HW is configured to insert the TX time\ninto the frame, so there is no reason to keep the skb anymore. As in\nthis case the HW will never generate an interrupt to say that the frame\nwas timestamped, then the frame will never released.\nFix this by freeing the frame in case of one-step timestamping.",
