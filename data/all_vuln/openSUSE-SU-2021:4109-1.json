This impacts\n  ContextJNDISelector and insertFromJNDI element in\n  configuration files.\n+ Also in response to log4Shell/CVE-2021-44228, all database (JDBC) related\n  code in the project has been removed with no replacement.\n+ Note that the vulnerability mentioned in LOGBACK-1591 requires\n  write access to logback's configuration file as a\n  prerequisite. The log4Shell/CVE-2021-44228 and LOGBACK-1591\n  are of different severity levels. A successful RCE requires\n  all of the following conditions to be met:\n  - write access to logback.xml\n  - use of versions lower then 1.2.8\n  - reloading of poisoned configuration data, which implies\n    application restart or scan='true' set prior to attack\n",
