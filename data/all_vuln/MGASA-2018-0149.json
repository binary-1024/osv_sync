  "details": "In Tomcat 8.0.45, the description of the search algorithm used by the\nCGI Servlet to identify which script to execute was updated. The update\nwas not correct. As a result, some scripts may have failed to execute as\nexpected and other scripts may have been executed unexpectedly. Note\nthat the behavior of the CGI servlet has remained unchanged in this\nregard. It is only the documentation of the behavior that was wrong and\nhas been corrected (CVE-2017-15706).\n\nThe URL pattern of \"\" (the empty string) which exactly maps to the\ncontext root was not correctly handled when used as part of a\nsecurity constraint definition. This caused the constraint to be ignored.\nIt was, therefore, possible for unauthorized users to gain access to web\napplication resources that should have been protected. Only security\nconstraints with a URL pattern of the empty string were affected\n(CVE-2018-1304).\n\nSecurity constraints defined by annotations of Servlets were only\napplied once a Servlet had been loaded. Because security constraints\ndefined in this way apply to the URL pattern and any URLs below that\npoint, it was possible - depending on the order Servlets were loaded -\nfor some security constraints not to be applied. This could have exposed\nresources to users who were not authorized to access them\n(CVE-2018-1305).\n",
