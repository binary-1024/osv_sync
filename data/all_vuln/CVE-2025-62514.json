{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-62514","published":"2026-01-29T15:46:50.922Z","modified":"2026-01-29T19:56:22.349592Z","aliases":["GHSA-hrc9-gm58-pgj9"],"summary":"`libparsec_crypto` does not check for weak order point of curve 25519","details":"Parsec is a cloud-based application for cryptographically secure file sharing. In versions on the 3.x branch prior to 3.6.0, `libparsec_crypto`, a component of the Parsec application, does not check for weak order point of Curve25519 when compiled with its RustCrypto backend. In practice this means an attacker in a man-in-the-middle position would be able to provide weak order points to both parties in the Diffie-Hellman exchange, resulting in a high probability to for both parties to obtain the same shared key (hence leading to a successful SAS code exchange, misleading both parties into thinking no MITM has occurred) which is also known by the attacker. Note only Parsec web is impacted (as Parsec desktop uses `libparsec_crypto` with the libsodium backend). Version 3.6.0 of Parsec patches the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/scille/parsec-cloud","events":[{"introduced":"5427b653e3c6868cdbe38a2be3bdd4e7e20658c6"},{"fixed":"d541d7886fdf33d045eb91b16552bd2b66962df4"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.0.0-alpha"},{"fixed":"3.6.0"}]}}],"versions":["v3.0.0-alpha","v3.6.0-rc.0","v3.6.0-rc.1","v3.6.0-rc.2","v3.6.0-rc.3","v3.6.0-rc.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62514.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/62xxx/CVE-2025-62514.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Scille/parsec-cloud/blob/e7c5cdbc4234f606ccf3ab2be7e9edc22db16feb/libparsec/crates/crypto/src/rustcrypto/private.rs#L136-L138"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Scille/parsec-cloud/commit/197bb6387b49fec872b5e4a04dcdb82b3d2995b2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Scille/parsec-cloud/security/advisories/GHSA-hrc9-gm58-pgj9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek/blob/8c53a8f10b146a2fd65069437e3576e49b390e7a/curve25519-dalek/src/montgomery.rs#L132-L146"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek/blob/8c53a8f10b146a2fd65069437e3576e49b390e7a/x25519-dalek/src/x25519.rs#L364-L366"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62514"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-1240","CWE-327"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/62xxx/CVE-2025-62514.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
