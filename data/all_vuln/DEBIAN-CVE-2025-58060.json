In versions 2.4.12 and earlier, when the `AuthType` is set to anything but `Basic`, if the request contains an `Authorization: Basic ...` header, the password is not checked. This results in authentication bypass. Any configuration that allows an `AuthType` that is not `Basic` is affected. Version 2.4.13 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"cups","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/cups?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.3.3op2-3+deb11u10"}]}],"versions":["2.3.3op2-3+deb11u1","2.3.3op2-3+deb11u2","2.3.3op2-3+deb11u3","2.3.3op2-3+deb11u4","2.3.3op2-3+deb11u5","2.3.3op2-3+deb11u6","2.3.3op2-3+deb11u7","2.3.3op2-3+deb11u8","2.3.3op2-3+deb11u9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-58060.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cups","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/cups?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.2-3+deb12u9"}]}],"versions":["2.4.2-3","2.4.2-3+deb12u1","2.4.2-3+deb12u2","2.4.2-3+deb12u3","2.4.2-3+deb12u4","2.4.2-3+deb12u5","2.4.2-3+deb12u6","2.4.2-3+deb12u7","2.4.2-3+deb12u8"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-58060.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cups","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/cups?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.10-3+deb13u1"}]}],"versions":["2.4.10-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-58060.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cups","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/cups?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.10-4"}]}],"versions":["2.4.10-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-58060.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-58060"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H"}]}
