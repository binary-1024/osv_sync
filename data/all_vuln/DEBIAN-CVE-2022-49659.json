  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: m_can: m_can_{read_fifo,echo_tx_event}(): shift timestamp to full 32 bits  In commit 1be37d3b0414 (\"can: m_can: fix periph RX path: use rx-offload to ensure skbs are sent from softirq context\") the RX path for peripheral devices was switched to RX-offload.  Received CAN frames are pushed to RX-offload together with a timestamp. RX-offload is designed to handle overflows of the timestamp correctly, if 32 bit timestamps are provided.  The timestamps of m_can core are only 16 bits wide. So this patch shifts them to full 32 bit before passing them to RX-offload.",
