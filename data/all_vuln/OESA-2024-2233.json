It is designed to be fast and lean and incorporates modern features based on open standards. To help increase online privacy, Unbound supports DNS-over-TLS which allows clients to encrypt their communication. Unbound is available for most platforms such as FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, MacOS, Linux and Microsoft Windows. Unbound is a totally free, open source software under the BSD license. It doesn&apos;t make custom builds or provide specific features to paying customers only.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nThe DNS protocol in RFC 1035 and updates allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) by arranging for DNS queries to be accumulated for seconds, such that responses are later sent in a pulsing burst (which can be considered traffic amplification in some cases), aka the &quot;DNSBomb&quot; issue.(CVE-2024-33655)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"unbound","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/unbound&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.0-15.oe2003sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python3-unbound-1.11.0-15.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","unbound-1.11.0-15.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","unbound-debuginfo-1.11.0-15.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","unbound-debugsource-1.11.0-15.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","unbound-devel-1.11.0-15.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","unbound-help-1.11.0-15.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","unbound-libs-1.11.0-15.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["unbound-1.11.0-15.oe2003sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python3-unbound-1.11.0-15.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","unbound-1.11.0-15.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","unbound-debuginfo-1.11.0-15.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","unbound-debugsource-1.11.0-15.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","unbound-devel-1.11.0-15.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","unbound-help-1.11.0-15.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","unbound-libs-1.11.0-15.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-2233.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2024-2233"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-33655"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
