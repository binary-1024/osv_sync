{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"UBUNTU-CVE-2022-4510","published":"2023-01-26T21:18:00Z","modified":"2025-10-24T04:53:18Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-4510"],"details":"A path traversal vulnerability was identified in ReFirm Labs binwalk from version 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 included. By crafting a malicious PFS filesystem file, an attacker can get binwalk's PFS extractor to extract files at arbitrary locations when binwalk is run in extraction mode (-e option). Remote code execution can be achieved by building a PFS filesystem that, upon extraction, would extract a malicious binwalk module into the folder .config/binwalk/plugins.  This vulnerability is associated with program files src/binwalk/plugins/unpfs.py. This issue affects binwalk from 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 included.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"binwalk","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/binwalk@2.1.1-4?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.1+dfsg-1","2.0.1+dfsg-2","2.0.1+dfsg-3","2.1.1-1","2.1.1-2","2.1.1-3","2.1.1-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"binwalk","binary_version":"2.1.1-4"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2022/UBUNTU-CVE-2022-4510.json"}},{"package":{"name":"binwalk","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/binwalk@2.1.1-16?arch=source&distro=bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.1.1-16"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"binwalk","binary_version":"2.1.1-16"},{"binary_name":"python3-binwalk","binary_version":"2.1.1-16"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2022/UBUNTU-CVE-2022-4510.json"}},{"package":{"name":"binwalk","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:20.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/binwalk@2.2.0+dfsg1-1?arch=source&distro=focal"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.1.2~git20180830+dfsg1-1","2.2.0+dfsg1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"binwalk","binary_version":"2.2.0+dfsg1-1"},{"binary_name":"python3-binwalk","binary_version":"2.2.0+dfsg1-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2022/UBUNTU-CVE-2022-4510.json"}},{"package":{"name":"binwalk","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:22.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/binwalk@2.3.3+dfsg1-2?arch=source&distro=jammy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.3.2+dfsg1-1","2.3.3+dfsg1-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"binwalk","binary_version":"2.3.3+dfsg1-2"},{"binary_name":"python3-binwalk","binary_version":"2.3.3+dfsg1-2"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2022/UBUNTU-CVE-2022-4510.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-4510"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/pull/617"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/commit/696fe34ed680ffd951bfeca737feb4a0b98dde5c"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-4510"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
