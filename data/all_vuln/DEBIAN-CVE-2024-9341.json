{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-9341","published":"2024-10-01T19:15:09Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:20:07.986641Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-9341"],"details":"A flaw was found in Go. When FIPS mode is enabled on a system, container runtimes may incorrectly handle certain file paths due to improper validation in the containers/common Go library. This flaw allows an attacker to exploit symbolic links and trick the system into mounting sensitive host directories inside a container. This issue also allows attackers to access critical host files, bypassing the intended isolation between containers and the host system.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"golang-github-containers-common","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-containers-common?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.33.4+ds1-1","0.33.4+ds1-1+deb11u1","0.33.4+ds1-1+deb11u2","0.34.2+ds1-1","0.35.4+ds1-1","0.36.0+ds1-1","0.38.12+ds1-1","0.38.12+ds1-2","0.38.16+ds1-1","0.38.5+ds2-1","0.38.9+ds1-1","0.42.1+ds1-1","0.42.1+ds1-2","0.44.0+ds1-1","0.44.3+ds1-1","0.44.3+ds1-2","0.44.4+ds1-1","0.44.5+ds1-1","0.46.0+ds1-1","0.47.2+ds1-1","0.48.0+ds1-1","0.48.0+ds1-2","0.49.1+ds1-1","0.50.1+ds1-1","0.50.1+ds1-2","0.50.1+ds1-3","0.50.1+ds1-4","0.51.0+ds1-1","0.52.0+ds1-1","0.52.0+ds1-2","0.55.4+ds1-1","0.55.4+ds1-2","0.55.4+ds1-3","0.56.0+ds1-1","0.56.0+ds1-2","0.56.0+ds1-3","0.56.0+ds1-4","0.57.0+ds1-1","0.57.0+ds1-2","0.57.2+ds1-1","0.57.2+ds1-2","0.57.4+ds1-1","0.57.4+ds1-2","0.57.4+ds1-3","0.57.4+ds1-4","0.58.0+ds1-1","0.58.2+ds1-2","0.58.2+ds1-3","0.60.0+ds1-1","0.60.1+ds1-1","0.60.1+ds1-3","0.60.2+ds1-1","0.60.2+ds1-2","0.60.3+ds1-3","0.60.4+ds1-1","0.61.0+ds1-1","0.61.0+ds1-2","0.61.1+ds1-1","0.62.0+ds1-1","0.62.2+ds1-1","0.62.2+ds1-2","0.64.1+ds1-1","0.64.1+ds1-2","0.64.1+ds1-3","0.64.2+ds1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-9341.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-containers-common","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-containers-common?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.50.1+ds1-4","0.51.0+ds1-1","0.52.0+ds1-1","0.52.0+ds1-2","0.55.4+ds1-1","0.55.4+ds1-2","0.55.4+ds1-3","0.56.0+ds1-1","0.56.0+ds1-2","0.56.0+ds1-3","0.56.0+ds1-4","0.57.0+ds1-1","0.57.0+ds1-2","0.57.2+ds1-1","0.57.2+ds1-2","0.57.4+ds1-1","0.57.4+ds1-2","0.57.4+ds1-3","0.57.4+ds1-4","0.58.0+ds1-1","0.58.2+ds1-2","0.58.2+ds1-3","0.60.0+ds1-1","0.60.1+ds1-1","0.60.1+ds1-3","0.60.2+ds1-1","0.60.2+ds1-2","0.60.3+ds1-3","0.60.4+ds1-1","0.61.0+ds1-1","0.61.0+ds1-2","0.61.1+ds1-1","0.62.0+ds1-1","0.62.2+ds1-1","0.62.2+ds1-2","0.64.1+ds1-1","0.64.1+ds1-2","0.64.1+ds1-3","0.64.2+ds1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-9341.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-containers-common","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-containers-common?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.60.4+ds1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-9341.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-containers-common","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-containers-common?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.60.4+ds1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-9341.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-9341"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N"}]}
