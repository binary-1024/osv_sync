When reading data from a jfs filesystem, grub's jfs filesystem module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry to determine the internal buffer size, however, it improperly checks for integer overflows. A maliciouly crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculations to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result, the grub_jfs_lookup_symlink() function will write past the internal buffer length during grub_jfs_read_file(). This issue can be leveraged to corrupt grub's internal critical data and may result in arbitrary code execution, by-passing secure boot protections.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-0685"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2346120"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
