If a malicious server breaks a normal TCP flow and sends data before the 3-way handshake is complete, then the data sent by the malicious server will be accepted by web clients such as a web browser or Linux CLI utilities, but ignored by Suricata IDS signatures. This mostly affects IDS signatures for the HTTP protocol and TCP stream content; signatures for TCP packets will inspect such network traffic as usual.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"suricata","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/suricata@3.0-1?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.8-1build1","2.0.9-1","2.0.10-1","2.0.10-2","2.0.11-1","3.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"suricata","binary_version":"3.0-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2018/UBUNTU-CVE-2018-6794.json"}},{"package":{"name":"suricata","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/suricata@3.2-2ubuntu3?arch=source&distro=bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.2-2ubuntu3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"libhtp-0.5.23-1","binary_version":"3.2-2ubuntu3"},{"binary_name":"suricata","binary_version":"3.2-2ubuntu3"},{"binary_name":"suricata-hyperscan","binary_version":"3.2-2ubuntu3"},{"binary_name":"suricata-oinkmaster","binary_version":"3.2-2ubuntu3"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2018/UBUNTU-CVE-2018-6794.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-6794"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/2427"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/pull/3202/commits/e1ef57c848bbe4e567d5d4b66d346a742e3f77a1"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-6794"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
