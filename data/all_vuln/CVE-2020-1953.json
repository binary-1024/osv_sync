Apache Commons Configuration versions 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 did not change the default settings of this library. So if a YAML file was loaded from an untrusted source, it could therefore load and execute code out of the control of the host application.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/d0e00f2e147a9e9b13a6829133092f349b2882bf6860397368a52600%40%3Cannounce.tomcat.apache.org%3E"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r16a2e949e35780c8974cf66104e812410f3904f752df6b66bf292269%40%3Ccommits.servicecomb.apache.org%3E"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rde2186ad6ac0d6ed8d51af7509244adcf1ce0f9a3b7e1d1dd3b64676%40%3Ccommits.camel.apache.org%3E"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
