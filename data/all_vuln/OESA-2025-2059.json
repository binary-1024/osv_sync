The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.This is going to have an impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.Upgrading to version 6.1.147, 6.6.100, 6.12.40 or 6.15.8 eliminates this vulnerability. Applying the patch d3ed1d84a84538a39b3eb2055d6a97a936c108f2/fcda39a9c5b834346088c14b1374336b079466c1/a262370f385e53ff7470efdcdaf40468e5756717/a47d9d9895bad9ce0e840a39836f19ca0b2a343a/4f15ee98304b96e164ff2340e1dfd6181c3f42aa is able to eliminate this problem. The bugfix is ready for download at git.kernel.org. The best possible mitigation is suggested to be upgrading to the latest version.(CVE-2025-38495)\n\nA vulnerability classified as problematic was found in Linux Kernel up to 6.1.146/6.6.99/6.12.39/6.15.7 (Operating System).The CWE definition for the vulnerability is CWE-125. The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.As an impact it is known to affect confidentiality.Upgrading to version 6.1.147, 6.6.100, 6.12.40 or 6.15.8 eliminates this vulnerability. Applying the patch ff30dd3f15f443d2a0085b12ec2cc95d44f35fa7/955e8835855fed8e87f7d8c8075564a1746c1b4c/e0f3c0867d7d231c70984f05c97752caacd0daba/43ddd82e6a91913cea1c078e782afd8de60c3a53/66acb1586737a22dd7b78abc63213b1bcaa100e4 is able to eliminate this problem.
