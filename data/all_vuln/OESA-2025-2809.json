Features of Requests:  - GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE Requests:    + HTTP Header Request Attachment.    + Data/Params Request Attachment.    + Multipart File Uploads.    + CookieJar Support.    + Redirection History.    + Redirection Recursion Urllib Fix.    + Automatic Decompression of GZipped Content.    + Unicode URL Support.  - Authentication:    + URL + HTTP Auth Registry.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nRequests is a HTTP library. Prior to 2.32.0, when making requests through a Requests `Session`, if the first request is made with `verify=False` to disable cert verification, all subsequent requests to the same host will continue to ignore cert verification regardless of changes to the value of `verify`. This behavior will continue for the lifecycle of the connection in the connection pool. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.32.0.(CVE-2024-35195)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-requests","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python-requests&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.24.0-5.oe2003sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"noarch":["python-requests-help-2.24.0-5.oe2003sp4.noarch.rpm","python2-requests-2.24.0-5.oe2003sp4.noarch.rpm","python3-requests-2.24.0-5.oe2003sp4.noarch.rpm"],"src":["python-requests-2.24.0-5.oe2003sp4.src.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2809.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2809"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35195"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
