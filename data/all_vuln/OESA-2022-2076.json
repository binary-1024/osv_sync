  "details": "MySQL Connector/J is a native Java driver that converts JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) calls into the network protocol used by the MySQL database. It lets developers working with the Java programming language easily build programs and applets that interact with MySQL and connect all corporate data, even in a heterogeneous environment. MySQL Connector/J is a Type IV JDBC driver and has a complete JDBC feature set that supports the capabilities of MySQL.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nVulnerability in the MySQL Connectors component of Oracle MySQL (subcomponent: Connector/J). Supported versions that are affected are 8.0.15 and prior. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with logon to the infrastructure where MySQL Connectors executes to compromise MySQL Connectors. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of MySQL Connectors.
