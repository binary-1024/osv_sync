  "details": "Updated pdns packages fix security vulnerability:\n\nAn issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server when the HTTP\nremote backend is used in RESTful mode (without post=1 set), allowing a\nremote user to cause the HTTP backend to connect to an attacker-specified\nhost instead of the configured one, via a crafted DNS query. This can be\nused to cause a denial of service by preventing the remote backend from\ngetting a response, content spoofing if the attacker can time its own\nquery so that subsequent queries will use an attacker-controlled HTTP\nserver instead of the configured one, and possibly information disclosure\nif the Authoritative Server has access to internal servers (CVE-2019-3871).\n",
