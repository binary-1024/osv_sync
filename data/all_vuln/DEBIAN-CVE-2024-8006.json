When a user builds libpcap with remote packet capture support enabled, one of the functions that become available is pcap_findalldevs_ex().  One of the function arguments can be a filesystem path, which normally means a directory with input data files.  When the specified path cannot be used as a directory, the function receives NULL from opendir(), but does not check the return value and passes the NULL value to readdir(), which causes a NULL pointer derefence.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libpcap","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libpcap?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-2","1.10.1-1","1.10.1-2","1.10.1-3","1.10.1-4","1.10.1-4~bpo11+1","1.10.2-1","1.10.2-1~bpo11+1","1.10.3-1","1.10.3-1~bpo11+1","1.10.4-1","1.10.4-2","1.10.4-3","1.10.4-4","1.10.4-4.1","1.10.4-4.1~exp1","1.10.4-5","1.10.4-5+hurd.1","1.10.5-1","1.10.5-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-8006.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libpcap","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libpcap?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.3-1","1.10.4-1","1.10.4-2","1.10.4-3","1.10.4-4","1.10.4-4.1","1.10.4-4.1~exp1","1.10.4-5","1.10.4-5+hurd.1","1.10.5-1","1.10.5-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-8006.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libpcap","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libpcap?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.10.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-8006.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libpcap","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libpcap?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.10.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-8006.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-8006"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
