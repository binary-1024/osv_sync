In versions prior to 0.26.6, a hardcoded credential in the provided installation script (located at https://dokploy.com/install.sh, line 154) uses a hardcoded password when creating the database container. This means that nearly all Dokploy installations use the same database credentials and could be compromised. Version 0.26.6 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dokploy/dokploy","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d0ea8b5283750d9ad2af0a36b3f63009ad492754"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.1.0","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.10.10","v0.10.2","v0.10.3","v0.10.4","v0.10.5","v0.10.6","v0.10.7","v0.10.9","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.11.2","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.17.2","v0.17.3","v0.17.4","v0.17.5","v0.17.6","v0.17.7","v0.17.8","v0.17.9","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.18.2","v0.18.3","v0.18.4","v0.19.0","v0.19.1","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.20.0","v0.20.1","v0.20.2","v0.20.3","v0.20.4","v0.20.5","v0.20.6","v0.20.7","v0.20.8","v0.21.0","v0.21.1","v0.21.2","v0.21.3","v0.21.4","v0.21.5","v0.21.6","v0.21.7","v0.21.8","v0.22.0","v0.22.1","v0.22.2","v0.22.3","v0.22.4","v0.22.5","v0.22.6","v0.22.7","v0.23.0","v0.23.1","v0.23.2","v0.23.3","v0.23.4","v0.23.5","v0.23.6","v0.23.7","v0.24.0","v0.24.1","v0.24.10","v0.24.11","v0.24.12","v0.24.2","v0.24.3","v0.24.4","v0.24.5","v0.24.6","v0.24.7","v0.24.8","v0.24.9","v0.25.0","v0.25.1","v0.25.10","v0.25.11","v0.25.2","v0.25.3","v0.25.4","v0.25.5","v0.25.6","v0.25.7","v0.25.8","v0.25.9","v0.26.0","v0.26.1","v0.26.2","v0.26.3","v0.26.4","v0.26.5","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v0.9.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24840.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24840.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy/commit/b902c160a256ad345ac687c87eb092f1fab2c64d"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy/security/advisories/GHSA-jr65-3j3w-gjmc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24840"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-798"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24840.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
