  "details": "### Summary\n\ufeff\nA command echoing feature in the framework allows users to indirectly trigger privileged behavior by injecting special platform tags. Specifically, an unauthorized user can use the `/echo <qqbot-at-everyone />` command to cause the bot to send a message that mentions all members in the chat, bypassing any permission controls. This can lead to spam, disruption, or abuse of notification systems.\n\ufeff\n### Details\n\ufeff\nThe framework provides a command `/echo` that causes the bot to repeat any user-provided message verbatim in the group chat. However, the bot fails to sanitize or filter platform-specific control elements such as `<qqbot-at-everyone />`, which, when included in a message, mentions everyone (i.e., @\u5168\u4f53\u6210\u5458). While normal users are forbidden from using this tag in normal chats, the bot, which has higher privileges, is allowed to do so.\n\ufeff\nSince the `/echo` command blindly echoes any content, a user can exploit this by sending:\n\ufeff\n```\n/echo <qqbot-at-everyone />\n```\n\ufeff\nThe bot will then send a message containing `<qqbot-at-everyone />`, causing the platform to interpret it as an @\u5168\u4f53\u6210\u5458 command, effectively allowing an unauthorized user to @everyone via the bot.\n\ufeff\n### PoC\n\ufeff\n1. Set up a chatbot using the affected framework.\n2. Join the chat that includes the bot as a regular user with **no permission to use @\u5168\u4f53\u6210\u5458**.\n3. Send the following message in the chat:\n\ufeff\n```\n/echo <qqbot-at-everyone />\n```\n4. The bot will respond by repeating the message, and the platform will interpret `<qqbot-at-everyone />` as an @\u5168\u4f53\u6210\u5458 mention.\n5. All the chat members receive a notification, despite the user lacking that permission.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff",
