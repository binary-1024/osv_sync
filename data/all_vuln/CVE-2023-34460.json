The 1.4.0 release includes a regression on the Filesystem scope check for dotfiles on Unix. Previously dotfiles were not implicitly allowed by the glob wildcard scopes (eg. `$HOME/*`), but a regression was introduced when a configuration option for this behavior was implemented. Only Tauri applications using wildcard scopes in the `fs` endpoint are affected. The regression has been patched on version 1.4.1.\n\n","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-34460.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/34xxx/CVE-2023-34460.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/066c09a6ea06f42f550d090715e06beb65cd5564"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/6969#discussion_r1232018347"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7227"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/GHSA-wmff-grcw-jcfm"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34460"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-285"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/34xxx/CVE-2023-34460.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
