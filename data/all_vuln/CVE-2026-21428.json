{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-21428","published":"2026-01-01T17:54:43.959Z","modified":"2026-01-13T20:06:35.243614Z","aliases":["GHSA-wpc6-j37r-jcx7"],"summary":"cpp-httplib has CRLF injection in http headers","details":"cpp-httplib is a C++11 single-file header-only cross platform HTTP/HTTPS library. Prior to version 0.30.0, the ``write_headers`` function does not check for CR & LF characters in user supplied headers, allowing untrusted header value to escape header lines.\nThis vulnerability allows attackers to add extra headers, modify request body unexpectedly & trigger an SSRF attack. When combined with a server that supports http1.1 pipelining (springboot, python twisted etc), this can be used for server side request forgery (SSRF). Version 0.30.0 fixes this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"781c55f120f945d254832660ef9487776b8a90fc"}]}],"versions":["v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.10.2","v0.10.3","v0.10.4","v0.10.5","v0.10.6","v0.10.7","v0.10.8","v0.10.9","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.11.2","v0.11.3","v0.11.4","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.12.2","v0.12.3","v0.12.4","v0.12.5","v0.12.6","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.13.2","v0.13.3","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.14.2","v0.14.3","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.15.2","v0.15.3","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.16.2","v0.16.3","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.17.2","v0.17.3","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.18.2","v0.18.3","v0.18.4","v0.18.5","v0.18.6","v0.18.7","v0.19.0","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.2.6","v0.20.0","v0.20.1","v0.21.0","v0.22.0","v0.23.0","v0.23.1","v0.24.0","v0.25.0","v0.26.0","v0.27.0","v0.28.0","v0.29.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.10","v0.5.11","v0.5.12","v0.5.13","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.5.5","v0.5.6","v0.5.7","v0.5.8","v0.5.9","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.6.5","v0.6.6","v0.6.7","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.10","v0.7.11","v0.7.12","v0.7.13","v0.7.14","v0.7.15","v0.7.16","v0.7.17","v0.7.18","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.4","v0.7.5","v0.7.6","v0.7.7","v0.7.8","v0.7.9","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.8.4","v0.8.5","v0.8.6","v0.8.7","v0.8.8","v0.8.9","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.10","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v0.9.4","v0.9.5","v0.9.6","v0.9.7","v0.9.8","v0.9.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-21428.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/21xxx/CVE-2026-21428.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib/commit/98048a033a532ff22320ce1d11789f8d5710dfcd"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib/releases/tag/v0.30.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib/security/advisories/GHSA-wpc6-j37r-jcx7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-21428"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-93"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/21xxx/CVE-2026-21428.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
