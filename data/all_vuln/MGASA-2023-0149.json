  "details": "This kernel-linus update is based on upstream 5.15.106 and fixes atleast the\nfollowing security issues:\n\nA flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. The tun/tap sockets have their socket\nUID hardcoded to 0 due to a type confusion in their initialization function.\nWhile it will be often correct, as tuntap devices require CAP_NET_ADMIN,\nit may not always be the case, e.g., a non-root user only having that\ncapability. This would make tun/tap sockets being incorrectly treated in\nfiltering/routing decisions, possibly bypassing network filters\n(CVE-2023-1076).\n\nIn the Linux kernel, pick_next_rt_entity() may return a type confused entry,\nnot detected by the BUG_ON condition, as the confused entry will not be\nNULL, but list_head.The buggy error condition would lead to a type confused\nentry with the list head,which would then be used as a type confused\nsched_rt_entity,causing memory corruption (CVE-2023-1077).\n\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free may be triggered in\nasus_kbd_backlight_set when plugging/disconnecting in a malicious USB device,\nwhich advertises itself as an Asus device. Similarly to the previous known\nCVE-2023-25012, but in asus devices, the work_struct may be scheduled by the\nLED controller while the device is disconnecting, triggering a use-after-free\non the struct asus_kbd_leds *led structure. A malicious USB device may\nexploit the issue to cause memory corruption with controlled data\n(CVE-2023-1079).\n\nA flaw use after free in the Linux kernel integrated infrared receiver/\ntransceiver driver was found in the way user detaching rc device. A local\nuser could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate their\nprivileges on the system (CVE-2023-1118).\n\nA use-after-free flaw was found in btrfs_search_slot in fs/btrfs/ctree.c\nin btrfs in the Linux Kernel.This flaw allows an attacker to crash the\nsystem and possibly cause a kernel information leak (CVE-2023-1611).\n\nA flaw use after free in the Linux kernel Xircom 16-bit PCMCIA (PC-card)\nEthernet driver was found.A local user could use this flaw to crash the\nsystem or potentially escalate their privileges on the system\n(CVE-2023-1670).\n\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel traffic control index\nfilter (tcindex) can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\nThe tcindex_delete function which does not properly deactivate filters in\ncase of a perfect hashes while deleting the underlying structure which can\nlater lead to double freeing the structure. A local attacker user can use\nthis vulnerability to elevate its privileges to root (CVE-2023-1829).\n\nA use-after-free flaw was found in xgene_hwmon_remove in drivers/hwmon/\nxgene-hwmon.c in the Hardware Monitoring Linux Kernel Driver (xgene-hwmon).\nThis flaw could allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a race\nproblem. This vulnerability could even lead to a kernel information leak\nproblem (CVE-2023-1855).\n\nA use-after-free flaw was found in btsdio_remove in drivers\\bluetooth\\\nbtsdio.c in the Linux Kernel. In this flaw, a call to btsdio_remove with\nan unfinished job, may cause a race problem leading to a UAF on hdev\ndevices (CVE-2023-1989).\n\nA use-after-free flaw was found in ndlc_remove in drivers/nfc/st-nci/ndlc.c\nin the Linux Kernel. This flaw could allow an attacker to crash the system\ndue to a race problem (CVE-2023-1990).\n\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel Traffic Control (TC) subsystem. Using\na specific networking configuration (redirecting egress packets to ingress\nusing TC action \"mirred\") a local unprivileged user could trigger a CPU\nsoft lockup (ABBA deadlock) when the transport protocol in use (TCP or\nSCTP) does a retransmission, resulting in a denial of service condition\n(CVE-2022-4269).\n\nA use-after-free vulnerability was found in __nfs42_ssc_open() in\nfs/nfs/nfs4file.c in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows an attacker to\nconduct a remote denial of service (CVE-2022-4379).\n\nThe Linux kernel through 6.1.9 has a Use-After-Free in bigben_remove in\ndrivers/hid/hid-bigbenff.c via a crafted USB device because the LED\ncontrollers remain registered for too long (CVE-2023-25012).\n\ndo_tls_getsockopt in net/tls/tls_main.c in the Linux kernel through 6.2.6\nlacks a lock_sock call, leading to a race condition (with a resultant\nuse-after-free or NULL pointer dereference) (CVE-2023-28466).\n\nAn issue was discovered in arch/x86/kvm/vmx/nested.c in the Linux kernel\nbefore 6.2.8. nVMX on x86_64 lacks consistency checks for CR0 and CR4\n(CVE-2023-30456).\n\nThe Linux kernel before 6.2.9 has a race condition and resultant\nuse-after-free in drivers/power/supply/da9150-charger.c if a physically\nproximate attacker unplugs a device (CVE-2023-30772).\n\nFor other upstream fixes in this update, see the referenced changelogs.\n",
