Prior to version 5.9.2, a malformed OID in a SET request to `SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB::vacmAccessTable` can cause an out-of-bounds memory access. A user with read-write credentials can exploit the issue. Version 5.9.2 contains a patch. Users should use strong SNMPv3 credentials and avoid sharing the credentials. Those who must use SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c should use a complex community string and enhance the protection by restricting access to a given IP address range.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"net-snmp","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/net-snmp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.9+dfsg-4+deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["5.9+dfsg-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-24807.json"}},{"package":{"name":"net-snmp","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/net-snmp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.9.3+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-24807.json"}},{"package":{"name":"net-snmp","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/net-snmp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.9.3+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-24807.json"}},{"package":{"name":"net-snmp","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/net-snmp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.9.3+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-24807.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-24807"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
