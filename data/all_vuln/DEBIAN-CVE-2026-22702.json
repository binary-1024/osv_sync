Prior to version 20.36.1, TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) vulnerabilities in virtualenv allow local attackers to perform symlink-based attacks on directory creation operations. An attacker with local access can exploit a race condition between directory existence checks and creation to redirect virtualenv's app_data and lock file operations to attacker-controlled locations. This issue has been patched in version 20.36.1.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-virtualenv","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-virtualenv?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["20.10.0+ds-1","20.12.1+ds-1","20.13.0+ds-1","20.13.0+ds-2","20.14.0+ds-1","20.15.0+ds-1","20.16.3+ds-1","20.16.3+ds-2","20.16.3+ds-3","20.16.3+ds-4","20.16.3+ds-4.1","20.16.3+ds-5","20.16.6+ds-1","20.17.1+ds-1","20.19.0+ds-1","20.21.0+ds-1","20.23.0+ds-1","20.23.0+ds-2","20.24.1+ds-1","20.24.6+ds-1","20.24.6+ds-2","20.25.0+ds-1","20.25.0+ds-2","20.25.1+ds-1","20.26.1+ds-1","20.26.2+ds-1","20.26.6+ds-1","20.27.0+ds-1","20.28.0+ds-1","20.29.1+ds-1","20.29.3+ds-1","20.30.0+ds-1","20.30.0+ds-2","20.30.0+ds-3","20.31.2+ds-1","20.33.1+ds-1","20.34.0+ds-1","20.35.3+ds-1","20.35.4+ds-1","20.4.0+ds-2","20.4.0+ds-2+deb11u1","20.4.6+ds-1","20.4.6+ds-2","20.9.0+ds-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22702.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-virtualenv","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-virtualenv?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["20.17.1+ds-1","20.19.0+ds-1","20.21.0+ds-1","20.23.0+ds-1","20.23.0+ds-2","20.24.1+ds-1","20.24.6+ds-1","20.24.6+ds-2","20.25.0+ds-1","20.25.0+ds-2","20.25.1+ds-1","20.26.1+ds-1","20.26.2+ds-1","20.26.6+ds-1","20.27.0+ds-1","20.28.0+ds-1","20.29.1+ds-1","20.29.3+ds-1","20.30.0+ds-1","20.30.0+ds-2","20.30.0+ds-3","20.31.2+ds-1","20.33.1+ds-1","20.34.0+ds-1","20.35.3+ds-1","20.35.4+ds-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22702.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-virtualenv","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-virtualenv?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["20.31.2+ds-1","20.33.1+ds-1","20.34.0+ds-1","20.35.3+ds-1","20.35.4+ds-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22702.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-virtualenv","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-virtualenv?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["20.31.2+ds-1","20.33.1+ds-1","20.34.0+ds-1","20.35.3+ds-1","20.35.4+ds-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22702.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2026-22702"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
