Instead of changing '>' to '>=' there, add the bounds check at the start of the second 'case' (the first one already has it).  Also, remove redundant last checks for 'j' index bigger than array size. The expression is always false. Moreover, before or after the patch 'table->last' can be equal to SMC_NISLANDS_MC_REGISTER_ARRAY_SIZE and it seems it can be a valid value.
