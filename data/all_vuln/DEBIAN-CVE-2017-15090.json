This allows an attacker in position of man-in-the-middle to alter the content of records by issuing a valid signature for the crafted records.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"pdns-recursor","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/pdns-recursor?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2017-15090.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pdns-recursor","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/pdns-recursor?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2017-15090.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pdns-recursor","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/pdns-recursor?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2017-15090.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pdns-recursor","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/pdns-recursor?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2017-15090.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15090"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
