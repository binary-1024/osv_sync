If a specially crafted cpio entry carries a non-zero-terminated filename and is followed by uninitialized memory, then a file may be created with trailing characters that represent the uninitialized memory. The ability to create an initramfs entry would imply already having full control of the system, so the buffer overrun shouldn't be considered a security vulnerability.  Append the output of the following bash script to an existing initramfs and observe any created /initramfs_test_fname_overrunAA* path. E.g.   ./reproducer.sh | gzip >> /myinitramfs  It's easiest to observe non-zero uninitialized memory when the output is gzipped, as it'll overflow the heap allocated @out_buf in __gunzip(), rather than the initrd_start+initrd_size block.  ---- reproducer.sh ---- nilchar=\"A\"\t# change to \"\\0\" to properly zero terminate / pad magic=\"070701\" ino=1 mode=$(( 0100777 )) uid=0 gid=0 nlink=1 mtime=1 filesize=0 devmajor=0 devminor=1 rdevmajor=0 rdevminor=0 csum=0 fname=\"initramfs_test_fname_overrun\" namelen=$(( ${#fname} + 1 ))\t# plus one to account for terminator  printf \"%s%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%08x%s\" \\ \t$magic $ino $mode $uid $gid $nlink $mtime $filesize \\ \t$devmajor $devminor $rdevmajor $rdevminor $namelen $csum $fname  termpadlen=$(( 1 + ((4 - ((110 + $namelen) & 3)) % 4) )) printf \"%.s${nilchar}\" $(seq 1 $termpadlen) ---- reproducer.sh ----  Symlink filename fields handled in do_symlink() won't overrun past the data segment, due to the explicit zero-termination of the symlink target.
