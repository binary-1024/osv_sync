  "details": "Passing malformed 2- and 3-byte UTF-8 sequences (e.g. from start tag names)\nto the XML processing application on top of Expat can cause arbitrary\ndamage (e.g. code execution) depending on how invalid UTF-8 is handled\ninside the XML processor; validation was not their job but Expat's.\nExploits with code execution are known to exist. (CVE-2022-25235)\n\nPassing (one or more) namespace separator characters in \"xmlns[:prefix]\"\nattribute values made Expat send malformed tag names to the XML processor\non top of Expat which can cause arbitrary damage (e.g. code execution)\ndepending on such unexpectable cases are handled inside the XML processor;\nvalidation was not their job but Expat's. Exploits with code execution\nare known to exist. (CVE-2022-25236)\n\nFix stack exhaustion in doctype parsing that could be triggered by e.g. a\n2 megabytes file with a large number of opening braces. Expected impact\nis denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.\n(CVE-2022-25313)\n\nFix integer overflow in function copyString;  only affects the encoding\nname parameter at parser creation time which is often hardcoded (rather\nthan user input), takes a value in the gigabytes to trigger, and a 64-bit\nmachine.  Expected impact is denial of service. (CVE-2022-25314)\n\nFix integer overflow in function storeRawNames; needs input in the\ngigabytes and a 64-bit machine. Expected impact is denial of service or\npotentially arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2022-25315)\n",
