A missing macro could lead to a miscalculation of the `h->nets` array offset, providing attackers with the primitive to arbitrarily increment/decrement a memory buffer out-of-bound. This issue may allow a local user to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7370"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7379"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7382"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7389"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7411"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7418"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7539"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7558"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0089"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0113"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0134"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0340"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0346"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0347"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0371"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0376"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0378"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0402"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0403"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0412"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0461"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0562"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0563"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0593"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0999"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-42753"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2023/q3/216"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2239843"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/175963/Kernel-Live-Patch-Security-Notice-LSN-0099-1.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00027.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/01/msg00004.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/22/10"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
