{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68215","published":"2025-12-16T14:15:54.490Z","modified":"2026-01-10T14:07:57.751118Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-68215"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: fix PTP cleanup on driver removal in error path  Improve the cleanup on releasing PTP resources in error path. The error case might happen either at the driver probe and PTP feature initialization or on PTP restart (errors in reset handling, NVM update etc). In both cases, calls to PF PTP cleanup (ice_ptp_cleanup_pf function) and 'ps_lock' mutex deinitialization were missed. Additionally, ptp clock was not unregistered in the latter case.  Keep PTP state as 'uninitialized' on init to distinguish between error scenarios and to avoid resource release duplication at driver removal.  The consequence of missing ice_ptp_cleanup_pf call is the following call trace dumped when ice_adapter object is freed (port list is not empty, as it is required at this stage):  [  T93022] ------------[ cut here ]------------ [  T93022] WARNING: CPU: 10 PID: 93022 at ice/ice_adapter.c:67 ice_adapter_put+0xef/0x100 [ice] ...
