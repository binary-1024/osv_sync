  "details": "Mozilla Firefox is a standalone web browser, designed for standards compliance and performance.  Its functionality can be enhanced via a plethora of extensions.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nThe JIT created incorrect code for arguments in certain cases. This led to potential use-after-free crashes during garbage collection. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 125, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.10, and Thunderbird &lt; 115.10.(CVE-2024-3857)\n\nIn resizeToAtLeast of SkRegion.cpp, there is a possible out of bounds write due to an integer overflow. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.(CVE-2024-43097)\n\nIt was possible to cause a use-after-free in the content process side of a WebTransport connection, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 136, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.21, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.8, Thunderbird &lt; 136, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.8.(CVE-2025-1931)\n\nAn inconsistent comparator in xslt/txNodeSorter could have resulted in potentially exploitable out-of-bounds access. Only affected version 122 and later. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 136, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.8, Thunderbird &lt; 136, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.8.(CVE-2025-1932)\n\nOn 64-bit CPUs, when the JIT compiles WASM i32 return values they can pick up bits from left over memory. This can potentially cause them to be treated as a different type. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 136, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.21, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.8, Thunderbird &lt; 136, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.8.(CVE-2025-1933)\n\nIt was possible to interrupt the processing of a RegExp bailout and run additional JavaScript, potentially triggering garbage collection when the engine was not expecting it. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 136, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.8, Thunderbird &lt; 136, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.8.(CVE-2025-1934)\n\nA web page could trick a user into setting that site as the default handler for a custom URL protocol. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 136, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.8, Thunderbird &lt; 136, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.8.(CVE-2025-1935)\n\njar: URLs retrieve local file content packaged in a ZIP archive. The null and everything after it was ignored when retrieving the content from the archive, but the fake extension after the null was used to determine the type of content. This could have been used to hide code in a web extension disguised as something else like an image. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 136, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.8, Thunderbird &lt; 136, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.8.(CVE-2025-1936)\n\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 135, Thunderbird 135, Firefox ESR 115.20, Firefox ESR 128.7, and Thunderbird 128.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 136, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.21, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.8, Thunderbird &lt; 136, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.8.(CVE-2025-1937)\n\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 135, Thunderbird 135, Firefox ESR 128.7, and Thunderbird 128.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 136, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.8, Thunderbird &lt; 136, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.8.(CVE-2025-1938)",
