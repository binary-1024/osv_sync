{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-9820","published":"2026-01-26T20:16:09.370Z","modified":"2026-01-27T11:16:17.313525Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-9820"],"details":"A flaw was found in the GnuTLS library, specifically in the gnutls_pkcs11_token_init() function that handles PKCS#11 token initialization. When a token label longer than expected is processed, the function writes past the end of a fixed-size stack buffer. This programming error can cause the application using GnuTLS to crash or, in certain conditions, be exploited for code execution. As a result, systems or applications relying on GnuTLS may be vulnerable to a denial of service or local privilege escalation attacks.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gnutls28","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gnutls28?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.7.1-5","3.7.1-5+deb11u1","3.7.1-5+deb11u2","3.7.1-5+deb11u3","3.7.1-5+deb11u4","3.7.1-5+deb11u5","3.7.1-5+deb11u6","3.7.1-5+deb11u7","3.7.1-5+deb11u8","3.7.2-1","3.7.2-2","3.7.2-3","3.7.2-4","3.7.2-5","3.7.3-1","3.7.3-2","3.7.3-3","3.7.3-4","3.7.4-1","3.7.4-2","3.7.5-1","3.7.6-1","3.7.6-2","3.7.7-1","3.7.7-2","3.7.8-1","3.7.8-2","3.7.8-3","3.7.8-4","3.7.8-5","3.7.9-1","3.7.9-2","3.7.9-2+loong64","3.8.0+git20230413-1","3.8.0+git20230529-1","3.8.0+git20230713-1","3.8.1-1","3.8.1-2","3.8.1-3","3.8.1-4","3.8.10-1","3.8.10-2","3.8.10-3","3.8.11-1","3.8.11-2","3.8.11-3","3.8.2-1","3.8.3-1","3.8.3-1.1","3.8.3-1.1~exp1","3.8.4-1","3.8.4-2","3.8.5-1","3.8.5-2","3.8.5-3","3.8.5-4","3.8.6-1","3.8.6-2","3.8.7.1-1","3.8.8-1","3.8.8-2","3.8.9-1","3.8.9-2","3.8.9-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-9820.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnutls28","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gnutls28?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.7.9-2","3.7.9-2+deb12u1","3.7.9-2+deb12u2","3.7.9-2+deb12u3","3.7.9-2+deb12u4","3.7.9-2+deb12u5","3.7.9-2+loong64","3.8.0+git20230413-1","3.8.0+git20230529-1","3.8.0+git20230713-1","3.8.1-1","3.8.1-2","3.8.1-3","3.8.1-4","3.8.10-1","3.8.10-2","3.8.10-3","3.8.11-1","3.8.11-2","3.8.11-3","3.8.2-1","3.8.3-1","3.8.3-1.1","3.8.3-1.1~exp1","3.8.4-1","3.8.4-2","3.8.5-1","3.8.5-2","3.8.5-3","3.8.5-4","3.8.6-1","3.8.6-2","3.8.7.1-1","3.8.8-1","3.8.8-2","3.8.9-1","3.8.9-2","3.8.9-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-9820.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnutls28","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gnutls28?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.8.9-3+deb13u1"}]}],"versions":["3.8.9-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-9820.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnutls28","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gnutls28?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.8.11-3"}]}],"versions":["3.8.10-1","3.8.10-2","3.8.10-3","3.8.11-1","3.8.11-2","3.8.9-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-9820.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-9820"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
