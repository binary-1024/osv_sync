{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47153","published":"2024-03-25T09:15:09Z","modified":"2025-09-30T03:54:21Z","upstream":["CVE-2021-47153"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: i801: Don't generate an interrupt on bus reset  Now that the i2c-i801 driver supports interrupts, setting the KILL bit in a attempt to recover from a timed out transaction triggers an interrupt. Unfortunately, the interrupt handler (i801_isr) is not prepared for this situation and will try to process the interrupt as if it was signaling the end of a successful transaction. In the case of a block transaction, this can result in an out-of-range memory access.  This condition was reproduced several times by syzbot: https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=ed71512d469895b5b34e https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=8c8dedc0ba9e03f6c79e https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=c8ff0b6d6c73d81b610e https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=33f6c360821c399d69eb https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=be15dc0b1933f04b043a https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=b4d3fd1dfd53e90afd79  So disable interrupts while trying to reset the bus. Interrupts will be enabled again for the following transaction.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.46-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47153.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.14.6-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47153.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.14.6-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47153.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.14.6-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47153.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-47153"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"}]}
