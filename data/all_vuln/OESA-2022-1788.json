A path traversal vulnerability affects versions of Flatpak prior to 1.12.3 and 1.10.6. flatpak-builder applies `finish-args` last in the build. At this point the build directory will have the full access that is specified in the manifest, so running `flatpak build` against it will gain those permissions. Normally this will not be done, so this is not problem. However, if `--mirror-screenshots-url` is specified, then flatpak-builder will launch `flatpak build --nofilesystem=host appstream-utils mirror-screenshots` after finalization, which can lead to issues even with the `--nofilesystem=host` protection. In normal use, the only issue is that these empty directories can be created wherever the user has write permissions. However, a malicious application could replace the `appstream-util` binary and potentially do something more hostile. This has been resolved in Flatpak 1.12.3 and 1.10.6 by changing the behaviour of `--nofilesystem=home` and `--nofilesystem=host`.(CVE-2022-21682)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"flatpak-builder","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/flatpak-builder&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.14-2.oe2203"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["flatpak-builder-debugsource-1.0.14-2.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","flatpak-builder-debuginfo-1.0.14-2.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","flatpak-builder-1.0.14-2.oe2203.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["flatpak-builder-1.0.14-2.oe2203.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["flatpak-builder-debuginfo-1.0.14-2.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","flatpak-builder-1.0.14-2.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","flatpak-builder-debugsource-1.0.14-2.oe2203.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1788.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2022-1788"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21682"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
