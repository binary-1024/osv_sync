Versions of nextcloudcmd prior to 3.6.1 would incorrectly trust invalid TLS certificates, which may enable a Man-in-the-middle attack that exposes sensitive data or credentials to a network attacker. This affects the CLI only. It does not affect the standard GUI desktop Nextcloud clients, and it does not affect the Nextcloud server.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nextcloud-desktop","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nextcloud-desktop?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.1-2+deb11u2"}]}],"versions":["3.1.1-2","3.1.1-2+deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-39334.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nextcloud-desktop","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nextcloud-desktop?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-39334.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nextcloud-desktop","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nextcloud-desktop?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-39334.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nextcloud-desktop","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nextcloud-desktop?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-39334.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39334"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
