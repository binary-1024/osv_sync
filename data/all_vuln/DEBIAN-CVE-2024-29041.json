Versions of Express.js prior to 4.19.0 and all pre-release alpha and beta versions of 5.0 are affected by an open redirect vulnerability using malformed URLs. When a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL Express performs an encode [using `encodeurl`](https://github.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the contents before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list. The main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`. The vulnerability is fixed in 4.19.2 and 5.0.0-beta.3.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"node-express","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-express?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.17.1+~cs4.17.13-1","4.17.1-3","4.17.2+~4.17.13-1","4.17.3+~4.17.13-1","4.17.3+~4.17.13-2","4.18.0+~4.17.13-1","4.18.1+~4.17.13-1","4.18.2+~4.17.14-1","4.18.2+~cs8.34.50-1","4.19.2+~cs8.36.21-1","4.19.2+~cs8.36.26-1","4.21.0+~cs8.36.26-1","4.21.0+~cs8.36.26-2","4.21.2+~cs8.36.27-1","4.21.2+~cs8.36.27-2","4.21.2+~cs8.36.27-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-29041.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-express","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-express?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.18.2+~4.17.14-1","4.18.2+~cs8.34.50-1","4.19.2+~cs8.36.21-1","4.19.2+~cs8.36.26-1","4.21.0+~cs8.36.26-1","4.21.0+~cs8.36.26-2","4.21.2+~cs8.36.27-1","4.21.2+~cs8.36.27-2","4.21.2+~cs8.36.27-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-29041.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-express","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-express?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.19.2+~cs8.36.21-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-29041.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-express","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-express?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.19.2+~cs8.36.21-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-29041.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-29041"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
