  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring/kbuf: hold io_buffer_list reference over mmap\n\nIf we look up the kbuf, ensure that it doesn't get unregistered until\nafter we're done with it. Since we're inside mmap, we cannot safely use\nthe io_uring lock. Rely on the fact that we can lookup the buffer list\nunder RCU now and grab a reference to it, preventing it from being\nunregistered until we're done with it. The lookup returns the\nio_buffer_list directly with it referenced.",
