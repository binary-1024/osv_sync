  "details": "\nAs indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the\nIceweasel version in the oldstable distribution (Etch) needed to be\nstopped before the end of the regular security maintenance life cycle.\n\n\nYou are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still\nsupported browser.\n\n\nOn a side note, please note that the Debian stable/Lenny version of\nIceweasel - the unbranded version of the Firefox browser - links\ndynamically against the Xulrunner library. As such, most of the\nvulnerabilities found in Firefox need only be fixed in the Xulrunner\npackage and don't require updates to the Iceweasel package any longer.\n\n\n",
