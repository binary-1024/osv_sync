{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2018-7158","published":"2018-05-17T14:29:00Z","modified":"2025-09-30T04:49:08.880506Z","upstream":["CVE-2018-7158"],"details":"The `'path'` module in the Node.js 4.x release line contains a potential regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vector. The code in question was replaced in Node.js 6.x and later so this vulnerability only impacts all versions of Node.js 4.x. The regular expression, `splitPathRe`, used within the `'path'` module for the various path parsing functions, including `path.dirname()`, `path.extname()` and `path.parse()` was structured in such a way as to allow an attacker to craft a string, that when passed through one of these functions, could take a significant amount of time to evaluate, potentially leading to a full denial of service.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nodejs","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nodejs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.11.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.4.3-r0","4.4.4-r0","4.4.5-r0","4.4.7-r0","4.5.0-r0","6.10.0-r0","6.10.1-r0","6.10.3-r0","6.11.0-r0","6.11.1-r0","6.11.1-r1","6.11.1-r2","6.11.2-r0","6.11.3-r0","6.11.4-r0","6.11.5-r0","6.9.1-r0","6.9.1-r1","6.9.2-r0","6.9.4-r0","6.9.4-r1","6.9.5-r0","6.9.5-r1","8.10.0-r0","8.9.0-r0","8.9.1-r0","8.9.2-r0","8.9.3-r0","8.9.3-r1","8.9.4-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-7158.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nodejs","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nodejs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.11.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.4.3-r0","4.4.4-r0","4.4.5-r0","4.4.7-r0","4.5.0-r0","6.10.0-r0","6.10.1-r0","6.10.3-r0","6.11.0-r0","6.11.1-r0","6.11.1-r1","6.11.1-r2","6.11.2-r0","6.11.3-r0","6.11.4-r0","6.11.5-r0","6.9.1-r0","6.9.1-r1","6.9.2-r0","6.9.4-r0","6.9.4-r1","6.9.5-r0","6.9.5-r1","8.10.0-r0","8.9.0-r0","8.9.1-r0","8.9.2-r0","8.9.3-r0","8.9.3-r1","8.9.4-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-7158.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nodejs","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nodejs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.11.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.4.3-r0","4.4.4-r0","4.4.5-r0","4.4.7-r0","4.5.0-r0","6.10.0-r0","6.10.1-r0","6.10.3-r0","6.11.0-r0","6.11.1-r0","6.11.1-r1","6.11.1-r2","6.11.2-r0","6.11.3-r0","6.11.4-r0","6.11.5-r0","6.9.1-r0","6.9.1-r1","6.9.2-r0","6.9.4-r0","6.9.4-r1","6.9.5-r0","6.9.5-r1","8.10.0-r0","8.9.0-r0","8.9.1-r0","8.9.2-r0","8.9.3-r0","8.9.3-r1","8.9.4-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-7158.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nodejs","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nodejs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.11.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.4.3-r0","4.4.4-r0","4.4.5-r0","4.4.7-r0","4.5.0-r0","6.10.0-r0","6.10.1-r0","6.10.3-r0","6.11.0-r0","6.11.1-r0","6.11.1-r1","6.11.1-r2","6.11.2-r0","6.11.3-r0","6.11.4-r0","6.11.5-r0","6.9.1-r0","6.9.1-r1","6.9.2-r0","6.9.4-r0","6.9.4-r1","6.9.5-r0","6.9.5-r1","8.10.0-r0","8.9.0-r0","8.9.1-r0","8.9.2-r0","8.9.3-r0","8.9.3-r1","8.9.4-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-7158.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nodejs","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nodejs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.11.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.4.3-r0","4.4.4-r0","4.4.5-r0","4.4.7-r0","4.5.0-r0","6.10.0-r0","6.10.1-r0","6.10.3-r0","6.11.0-r0","6.11.1-r0","6.11.1-r1","6.11.1-r2","6.11.2-r0","6.11.3-r0","6.11.4-r0","6.11.5-r0","6.9.1-r0","6.9.1-r1","6.9.2-r0","6.9.4-r0","6.9.4-r1","6.9.5-r0","6.9.5-r1","8.10.0-r0","8.9.0-r0","8.9.1-r0","8.9.2-r0","8.9.3-r0","8.9.3-r1","8.9.4-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-7158.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nodejs","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nodejs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.11.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.4.3-r0","4.4.4-r0","4.4.5-r0","4.4.7-r0","4.5.0-r0","6.10.0-r0","6.10.1-r0","6.10.3-r0","6.11.0-r0","6.11.1-r0","6.11.1-r1","6.11.1-r2","6.11.2-r0","6.11.3-r0","6.11.4-r0","6.11.5-r0","6.9.1-r0","6.9.1-r1","6.9.2-r0","6.9.4-r0","6.9.4-r1","6.9.5-r0","6.9.5-r1","8.10.0-r0","8.9.0-r0","8.9.1-r0","8.9.2-r0","8.9.3-r0","8.9.3-r1","8.9.4-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-7158.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nodejs","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nodejs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.11.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.4.3-r0","4.4.4-r0","4.4.5-r0","4.4.7-r0","4.5.0-r0","6.10.0-r0","6.10.1-r0","6.10.3-r0","6.11.0-r0","6.11.1-r0","6.11.1-r1","6.11.1-r2","6.11.2-r0","6.11.3-r0","6.11.4-r0","6.11.5-r0","6.9.1-r0","6.9.1-r1","6.9.2-r0","6.9.4-r0","6.9.4-r1","6.9.5-r0","6.9.5-r1","8.10.0-r0","8.9.0-r0","8.9.1-r0","8.9.2-r0","8.9.3-r0","8.9.3-r1","8.9.4-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-7158.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nodejs","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nodejs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.11.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.4.3-r0","4.4.4-r0","4.4.5-r0","4.4.7-r0","4.5.0-r0","6.10.0-r0","6.10.1-r0","6.10.3-r0","6.11.0-r0","6.11.1-r0","6.11.1-r1","6.11.1-r2","6.11.2-r0","6.11.3-r0","6.11.4-r0","6.11.5-r0","6.9.1-r0",
