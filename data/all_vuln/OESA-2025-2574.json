It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++ (or other languages, depending on the chosen implementation). Python is also usable as an extension language for applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use scripting or automation interfaces.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability has been found in the CPython `venv` module and CLI where path names provided when creating a virtual environment were not quoted properly, allowing the creator to inject commands into virtual environment  activation  scripts (ie  source venv/bin/activate ). This means that attacker-controlled virtual environments are able to run commands when the virtual environment is activated. Virtual environments which are not created by an attacker or which aren t activated before being used (ie  ./venv/bin/python ) are not affected.(CVE-2024-9287)\n\nThe  zipfile  module in CPython would not check the validity of the ZIP64 End of Central Directory (EOCD) Locator record offset value. This offset value was not used to locate the ZIP64 EOCD record; instead, the ZIP64 EOCD record was assumed to be the previous record in the ZIP archive. This could be abused to create ZIP archives that are handled differently by the  zipfile  module compared to other ZIP implementations. Remediation maintains this behavior but checks that the offset specified in the ZIP64 EOCD Locator record matches the expected value.(CVE-2025-8291)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python3&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.9-47.oe2003sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python3-3.7.9-47.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-debug-3.7.9-47.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.7.9-47.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.7.9-47.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-devel-3.7.9-47.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["python3-help-3.7.9-47.oe2003sp4.noarch.rpm"],"src":["python3-3.7.9-47.oe2003sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python3-3.7.9-47.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-debug-3.7.9-47.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.7.9-47.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.7.9-47.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-devel-3.7.9-47.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2574.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2574"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9287"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-8291"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
