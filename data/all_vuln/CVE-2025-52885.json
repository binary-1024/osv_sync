{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-52885","published":"2025-10-10T22:11:20Z","modified":"2025-10-21T02:36:50Z","summary":"GHSL-2025-042: Poppler has Use-After-Free","details":"Poppler ia a library for rendering PDF files, and examining or modifying their structure. A use-after-free (write) vulnerability has been detected in versions Poppler prior to 25.10.0 within the StructTreeRoot class. The issue arises from the use of raw pointers to elements of a `std::vector`, which can lead to dangling pointers when the vector is resized. The vulnerability stems from the way that refToParentMap stores references to `std::vector` elements using raw pointers. These pointers may become invalid when the vector is resized. This vulnerability is a common security problem involving the use of raw pointers to `std::vectors`. Internally, `std::vector `stores its elements in a dynamically allocated array. When the array reaches its capacity and a new element is added, the vector reallocates a larger block of memory and moves all the existing elements to the new location. At this point if any pointers to elements are stored before a resize occurs, they become dangling pointers once the reallocation happens. Version 25.10.0 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-52885.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"25.10.0"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2025-042_poppler/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/-/merge_requests/1884"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/-/merge_requests/1884#note_3114334"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
