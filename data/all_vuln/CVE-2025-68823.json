{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68823","published":"2026-01-13T15:29:25.392Z","modified":"2026-01-13T20:05:29.188844Z","summary":"ublk: fix deadlock when reading partition table","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nublk: fix deadlock when reading partition table\n\nWhen one process(such as udev) opens ublk block device (e.g., to read\nthe partition table via bdev_open()), a deadlock[1] can occur:\n\n1. bdev_open() grabs disk->open_mutex\n2. The process issues read I/O to ublk backend to read partition table\n3. In __ublk_complete_rq(), blk_update_request() or blk_mq_end_request()\n   runs bio->bi_end_io() callbacks\n4. If this triggers fput() on file descriptor of ublk block device, the\n   work may be deferred to current task's task work (see fput() implementation)\n5. This eventually calls blkdev_release() from the same context\n6. blkdev_release() tries to grab disk->open_mutex again\n7. Deadlock: same task waiting for a mutex it already holds\n\nThe fix is to run blk_update_request() and blk_mq_end_request() with bottom\nhalves disabled. This forces blkdev_release() to run in kernel work-queue\ncontext instead of current task work context, and allows ublk server to make\nforward progress, and avoids the deadlock.\n\n[axboe: rewrite comment in ublk]","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"71f28f3136aff5890cd56de78abc673f8393cad9"},{"fixed":"0460e09a614291f06c008443f47393c37b7358e7"},{"fixed":"c258f5c4502c9667bccf5d76fa731ab9c96687c1"}]}],"versions":["v5.19","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.18","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5","v6.18-rc6","v6.18-rc7","v6.18.1","v6.18.2","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68823.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.18.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68823.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0460e09a614291f06c008443f47393c37b7358e7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c258f5c4502c9667bccf5d76fa731ab9c96687c1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68823.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68823"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68823.json"}}
