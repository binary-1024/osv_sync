GLib&amp;apos;s code was separated from GTK, so it can be used by software other than GNOME and has been developed in parallel ever since.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA flaw was found in how GLib’s GString manages memory when adding data to strings. If a string is already very large, combining it with more input can cause a hidden overflow in the size calculation. This makes the system think it has enough memory when it doesn’t. As a result, data may be written past the end of the allocated memory, leading to crashes or memory corruption.(CVE-2025-6052)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"glib2","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/glib2&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.78.3-9.oe2403sp2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["glib2-2.78.3-9.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","glib2-debuginfo-2.78.3-9.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","glib2-debugsource-2.78.3-9.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","glib2-devel-2.78.3-9.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","glib2-static-2.78.3-9.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","glib2-tests-2.78.3-9.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["glib2-help-2.78.3-9.oe2403sp2.noarch.rpm"],"src":["glib2-2.78.3-9.oe2403sp2.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["glib2-2.78.3-9.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","glib2-debuginfo-2.78.3-9.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","glib2-debugsource-2.78.3-9.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","glib2-devel-2.78.3-9.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","glib2-static-2.78.3-9.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","glib2-tests-2.78.3-9.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1797.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-1797"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-6052"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Low"}}
