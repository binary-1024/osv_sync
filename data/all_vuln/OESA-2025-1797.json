  "details": "GLib is a bundle of three (formerly five) low-level system libraries written in C and developed mainly by GNOME. GLib&amp;apos;s code was separated from GTK, so it can be used by software other than GNOME and has been developed in parallel ever since.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA flaw was found in how GLib\u2019s GString manages memory when adding data to strings. If a string is already very large, combining it with more input can cause a hidden overflow in the size calculation. This makes the system think it has enough memory when it doesn\u2019t. As a result, data may be written past the end of the allocated memory, leading to crashes or memory corruption.(CVE-2025-6052)",
