Versions 2024.05-2ubuntu0.3 and 2024.02-2ubuntu0.3 disable the Shell. Some previous versions inserted a secure-boot-based decision to continue running inside the Shell itself, which is believed to be sufficient to enforce Secure Boot restrictions. This is an additional repair on top of the incomplete fix for CVE-2023-48733.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"edk2","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/edk2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2020.11-2+deb11u2"}]}],"versions":["2020.11-2","2020.11-2+deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-2486.json"}},{"package":{"name":"edk2","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/edk2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2022.11-6+deb12u1"}]}],"versions":["2022.11-6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-2486.json"}},{"package":{"name":"edk2","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/edk2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2023.11-7"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-2486.json"}},{"package":{"name":"edk2","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/edk2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2023.11-7"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-2486.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-2486"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
