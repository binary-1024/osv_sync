It was found that snapctl did not properly parse command-line arguments, allowing an unprivileged user to trigger an authorised action on behalf of the snap that would normally require administrator privileges to perform. This could possibly allow an unprivileged user to perform a denial of service or similar.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"snapd","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/snapd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.49-1","2.49-1+deb11u1","2.49-1+deb11u2","2.51.7-1","2.51.7-2","2.54.1-1","2.54.3-1","2.54.3-1.1","2.57.6-1","2.59.5-1","2.60.2-1","2.61.1-1","2.61.2-1","2.61.2-2","2.62-1","2.62-2","2.62-3","2.62-4","2.62-5","2.63-1","2.63-2","2.63-3","2.63-4","2.65.1-1","2.65.3-1","2.66.1-1","2.66.1-2","2.67-1","2.68.3-2","2.68.3-3","2.71-1","2.71-2","2.71-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-5138.json"}},{"package":{"name":"snapd","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/snapd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.57.6-1","2.59.5-1","2.60.2-1","2.61.1-1","2.61.2-1","2.61.2-2","2.62-1","2.62-2","2.62-3","2.62-4","2.62-5","2.63-1","2.63-2","2.63-3","2.63-4","2.65.1-1","2.65.3-1","2.66.1-1","2.66.1-2","2.67-1","2.68.3-2","2.68.3-3","2.71-1","2.71-2","2.71-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-5138.json"}},{"package":{"name":"snapd","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/snapd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.62-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-5138.json"}},{"package":{"name":"snapd","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/snapd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.62-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-5138.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-5138"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H"}]}
