In hardened builds (e.g., UBSan or -ftrapv), the overflow may also result in process abort (DoS).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"docopt.cpp","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/docopt.cpp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.6.2-2.1","0.6.2-2.2","0.6.2-2.3","0.6.2-2.4","0.6.3-1","0.6.3-2","0.6.3-3","0.6.3-4","0.6.3-5"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-67125.json"}},{"package":{"name":"docopt.cpp","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/docopt.cpp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.6.2-2.3","0.6.2-2.4","0.6.3-1","0.6.3-2","0.6.3-3","0.6.3-4","0.6.3-5"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-67125.json"}},{"package":{"name":"docopt.cpp","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/docopt.cpp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.6.3-5"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-67125.json"}},{"package":{"name":"docopt.cpp","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/docopt.cpp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.6.3-5"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-67125.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-67125"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L"}]}
