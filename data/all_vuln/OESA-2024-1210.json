{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"OESA-2024-1210","published":"2024-03-01T11:07:04Z","modified":"2025-09-03T06:19:40.334636Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-50387","CVE-2023-50868","CVE-2024-1488"],"summary":"unbound security update","details":"Unbound is a validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver. It is designed to be fast and lean and incorporates modern features based on open standards. To help increase online privacy, Unbound supports DNS-over-TLS which allows clients to encrypt their communication. Unbound is available for most platforms such as FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, MacOS, Linux and Microsoft Windows. Unbound is a totally free, open source software under the BSD license. It doesn&apos;t make custom builds or provide specific features to paying customers only.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nCertain DNSSEC aspects of the DNS protocol (in RFC 4033, 4034, 4035, 6840, and related RFCs) allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via one or more DNSSEC responses, aka the &quot;KeyTrap&quot; issue. One of the concerns is that, when there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the protocol specification implies that an algorithm must evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG records.(CVE-2023-50387)\r\n\r\nThe Closest Encloser Proof aspect of the DNS protocol (in RFC 5155 when RFC 9276 guidance is skipped) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption for SHA-1 computations) via DNSSEC responses in a random subdomain attack, aka the &quot;NSEC3&quot; issue. The RFC 5155 specification implies that an algorithm must perform thousands of iterations of a hash function in certain situations.(CVE-2023-50868)\r\n\r\nA vulnerability was found in Unbound due to incorrect default permissions, allowing any process outside the unbound group to modify the unbound runtime configuration. If a process can connect over localhost to port 8953, it can alter the configuration of unbound.service. This flaw allows an unprivileged attacker to manipulate a running instance, potentially altering forwarders, allowing them to track all queries forwarded by the local resolver, and, in some cases, disrupting resolving altogether.(CVE-2024-1488)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"unbound","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/unbound&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.0-11.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["unbound-1.11.0-11.oe1.aarch64.rpm","unbound-devel-1.11.0-11.oe1.aarch64.rpm","unbound-help-1.11.0-11.oe1.aarch64.rpm","unbound-debuginfo-1.11.0-11.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-unbound-1.11.0-11.oe1.aarch64.rpm","unbound-libs-1.11.0-11.oe1.aarch64.rpm","unbound-debugsource-1.11.0-11.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["unbound-1.11.0-11.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["unbound-help-1.11.0-11.oe1.x86_64.rpm","unbound-libs-1.11.0-11.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-unbound-1.11.0-11.oe1.x86_64.rpm","unbound-debugsource-1.11.0-11.oe1.x86_64.rpm","unbound-debuginfo-1.11.0-11.oe1.x86_64.rpm","unbound-1.11.0-11.oe1.x86_64.rpm","unbound-devel-1.11.0-11.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-1210.json"}},{"package":{"name":"unbound","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/unbound&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.0-11.oe2003sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python3-unbound-1.11.0-11.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","unbound-devel-1.11.0-11.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","unbound-debuginfo-1.11.0-11.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","unbound-help-1.11.0-11.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","unbound-libs-1.11.0-11.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","unbound-debugsource-1.11.0-11.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","unbound-1.11.0-11.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["unbound-1.11.0-11.oe2003sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["unbound-help-1.11.0-11.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-unbound-1.11.0-11.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","unbound-1.11.0-11.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","unbound-debugsource-1.11.0-11.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","unbound-devel-1.11.0-11.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","unbound-libs-1.11.0-11.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","unbound-debuginfo-1.11.0-11.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-1210.json"}},{"package":{"name":"unbound","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/unbound&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.13.2-10.oe2203sp3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["unbound-libs-1.13.2-10.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","unbound-debugsource-1.13.2-10.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","unbound-help-1.13.2-10.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","unbound-devel-1.13.2-10.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","unbound-debuginfo-1.13.2-10.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","python3-unbound-1.13.2-10.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","unbound-1.13.2-10.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","unbound-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","unbound-help-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","unbound-debuginfo-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","unbound-devel-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","python3-unbound-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","unbound-libs-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","unbound-debugsource-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","unbound-help-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","unbound-libs-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","python3-unbound-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","unbound-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","unbound-devel-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","unbound-debugsource-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","unbound-debuginfo-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","python3-unbound-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","unbound-debugsource-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","unbound-debuginfo-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","unbound-devel-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","unbound-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","unbound-help-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","unbound-libs-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["unbound-1.13.2-10.oe2203.src.rpm","unbound-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp1.src.rpm","unbound-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp2.src.rpm","unbound-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp3.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["unbound-devel-1.13.2-10.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","unbound-help-1.13.2-10.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","unbound-debuginfo-1.13.2-10.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","unbound-libs-1.13.2-10.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","python3-unbound-1.13.2-10.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","unbound-1.13.2-10.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","unbound-debugsource-1.13.2-10.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","python3-unbound-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","unbound-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","unbound-debugsource-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","unbound-debuginfo-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","unbound-devel-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","unbound-help-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","unbound-libs-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","unbound-debuginfo-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","unbound-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","unbound-debugsource-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","unbound-devel-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","unbound-help-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","unbound-libs-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","python3-unbound-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","unbound-libs-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","unbound-debugsource-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","python3-unbound-1.13.2-10.oe2203sp
