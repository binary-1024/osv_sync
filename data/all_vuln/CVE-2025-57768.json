From 1.8.0 to before 1.8.3, a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Planned Hours field when creating a new project. When sending a POST request to /issues/new/, the value provided in the Planned Hours field is included in the server response without any HTML encoding or sanitization. Because of this, an attacker can craft a malicious payload such as <script>alert(1)</script> and include it in the planned_hours parameter. The server reflects the input directly in the HTML of the project creation page, causing the browser to interpret and execute it. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/alanaktion/phproject","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5970d68d480a1db87f87ed377aa77194db192d28"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.10","v1.7.11","v1.7.12","v1.7.13","v1.7.14","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.7.4","v1.7.5","v1.7.5a","v1.7.6","v1.7.7","v1.7.8","v1.7.9","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-57768.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Alanaktion/phproject/security/advisories/GHSA-mhhg-qx37-g369"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N"}]}
