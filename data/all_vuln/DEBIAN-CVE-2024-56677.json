{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-56677","published":"2024-12-28T10:15:08Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:19:57.711130Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-56677"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/fadump: Move fadump_cma_init to setup_arch() after initmem_init()  During early init CMA_MIN_ALIGNMENT_BYTES can be PAGE_SIZE, since pageblock_order is still zero and it gets initialized later during initmem_init() e.g. setup_arch() -> initmem_init() -> sparse_init() -> set_pageblock_order()  One such use case where this causes issue is - early_setup() -> early_init_devtree() -> fadump_reserve_mem() -> fadump_cma_init()  This causes CMA memory alignment check to be bypassed in cma_init_reserved_mem(). Then later cma_activate_area() can hit a VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(pfn & ((1 << order) - 1)) if the reserved memory area was not pageblock_order aligned.  Fix it by moving the fadump_cma_init() after initmem_init(), where other such cma reservations also gets called.  <stack trace> ============== page: refcount:0 mapcount:0 mapping:0000000000000000 index:0x0 pfn:0x10010 flags: 0x13ffff800000000(node=1|zone=0|lastcpupid=0x7ffff) CMA raw: 013ffff800000000 5deadbeef0000100 5deadbeef0000122 0000000000000000 raw: 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 00000000ffffffff 0000000000000000 page dumped because: VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(pfn & ((1 << order) - 1)) ------------[ cut here ]------------ kernel BUG at mm/page_alloc.c:778!
