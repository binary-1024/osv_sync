In affected versions, this can lead to unauthenticated access to sensitive credentials via HTTP/S. A remote attacker could retrieve these secrets by accessing specific URLs if the application is exposed externally. The issue affects deployments using the default value of usePasswordFiles=true, which mounts secrets as files into the container filesystem.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal","ecosystem":"Bitnami","purl":"pkg:bitnami/drupal"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"11.1.5-0"},{"fixed":"11.2.2-1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/bitnami/vulndb/tree/main/data/drupal/BIT-drupal-2025-41240.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/RL:O"}]}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bitnami/charts/security/advisories/GHSA-wgg9-9qgw-529w"}],"database_specific":{"cpes":["cpe:2.3:*:drupal:drupal:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"severity":"Critical"}}
