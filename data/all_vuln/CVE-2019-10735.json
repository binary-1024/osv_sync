The encrypted part(s) can further be hidden using HTML/CSS or ASCII newline characters. This modified multipart email can be re-sent by the attacker to the intended receiver. If the receiver replies to this (benign looking) email, they unknowingly leak the plaintext of the encrypted message part(s) back to the attacker.","references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.thewildbeast.co.uk/claws-mail/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4159"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
