{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-7394","published":"2025-07-18T23:15:23Z","modified":"2025-10-22T16:28:44.362565Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-7394"],"details":"In the OpenSSL compatibility layer implementation, the function RAND_poll() was not behaving as expected and leading to the potential for predictable values returned from RAND_bytes() after fork() is called. This can lead to weak or predictable random numbers generated in applications that are both using RAND_bytes() and doing fork() operations. This only affects applications explicitly calling RAND_bytes() after fork() and does not affect any internal TLS operations. Although RAND_bytes() documentation in OpenSSL calls out not being safe for use with fork() without first calling RAND_poll(), an additional code change was also made in wolfSSL to make RAND_bytes() behave similar to OpenSSL after a fork() call without calling RAND_poll(). Now the Hash-DRBG used gets reseeded after detecting running in a new process. If making use of RAND_bytes() and calling fork() we recommend updating to the latest version of wolfSSL. Thanks to Per Allansson from Appgate for the report.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wolfssl","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/wolfssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.6.0+p1-0+deb11u1","4.6.0+p1-0+deb11u2","4.6.0-3","5.0.0-1","5.0.0-1~bpo11+1","5.1.1-1","5.1.1-1~bpo11+1","5.2.0-1","5.2.0-2","5.2.0-2~bpo11+1","5.5.3-1","5.5.3-2","5.5.3-3","5.5.3-3~bpo11+1","5.5.4-1","5.5.4-2","5.5.4-2.1","5.5.4-2~bpo11+1","5.6.4-1","5.6.4-2","5.6.6-1","5.6.6-1.1","5.6.6-1.2","5.6.6-1.3","5.6.6-1.3~exp1","5.7.0-0.1","5.7.0-0.2","5.7.0-0.3","5.7.2-0.1","5.7.2-0.2","5.7.2-0.3","5.7.2-0.4","5.8.2-1","5.8.2-1.1","5.8.2-1.2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-7394.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wolfssl","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/wolfssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.5.4-2+deb12u2"}]}],"versions":["5.5.4-2","5.5.4-2+deb12u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-7394.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wolfssl","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/wolfssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.7.2-0.1+deb13u1"}]}],"versions":["5.7.2-0.1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-7394.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wolfssl","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/wolfssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.7.2-0.4"}]}],"versions":["5.7.2-0.1","5.7.2-0.2","5.7.2-0.3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-7394.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-7394"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
