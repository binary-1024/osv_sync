  "details": "This kerne-linusl update is based on upstream 5.15.126 and fixes or\nadds mitigations for atleast the following security issues:\n\nInformation exposure through microarchitectural state after transient\nexecution in certain vector execution units for some Intel(R) Processors\nmay allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure\nvia local access (CVE-2022-40982, INTEL-SA-00828).\n\nA hash collision flaw was found in the IPv6 connection lookup table in\nthe Linux kernel\u2019s IPv6 functionality when a user makes a new kind of SYN\nflood attack. A user located in the local network or with a high bandwidth\nconnection can increase the CPU usage of the server that accepts IPV6\nconnections up to 95% (CVE-2023-1206).\n\nA use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's netfilter in the\nway a user triggers the nft_pipapo_remove function with the element,\nwithout a NFT_SET_EXT_KEY_END. This issue could allow a local user to\ncrash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system\n(CVE-2023-4004).\n\nA use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel\u2019s Netfilter\nfunctionality when adding a rule with NFTA_RULE_CHAIN_ID. This flaw\nallows a local user to crash or escalate their privileges on the system\n(CVE-2023-4147).\n\nA side channel vulnerability in some of the AMD CPUs may allow an attacker\nto influence the return address prediction. This may result in speculative\nexecution at an attacker-controlled instruction pointer register,\npotentially leading to information disclosure (CVE-2023-20569).\n\nA buffer overrun vulnerability was found in the netback driver in Xen due\nto an unusual split packet. This flaw allows an unprivileged guest to cause\na denial of service (DoS) of the host by sending network packets to the\nbackend, causing the backend to crash (CVE-2023-34319, XSA-432).\n\nFor other upstream fixes in this update, see the referenced changelogs.\n",
