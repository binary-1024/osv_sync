{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47506","published":"2024-05-24T15:15:11Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:15:31.297068Z","upstream":["CVE-2021-47506"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfsd: fix use-after-free due to delegation race  A delegation break could arrive as soon as we've called vfs_setlease.  A delegation break runs a callback which immediately (in nfsd4_cb_recall_prepare) adds the delegation to del_recall_lru.  If we then exit nfs4_set_delegation without hashing the delegation, it will be freed as soon as the callback is done with it, without ever being removed from del_recall_lru.  Symptoms show up later as use-after-free or list corruption warnings, usually in the laundromat thread.  I suspect aba2072f4523 \"nfsd: grant read delegations to clients holding writes\" made this bug easier to hit, but I looked as far back as v3.0 and it looks to me it already had the same problem.  So I'm not sure where the bug was introduced; it may have been there from the beginning.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.92-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47506.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.15.15-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47506.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.15.15-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47506.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.15.15-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47506.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-47506"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
