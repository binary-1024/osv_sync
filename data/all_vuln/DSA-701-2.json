  "details": "\nIt has been discovered that the last security update for Samba, a\nLanManager like file and printer server for GNU/Linux and Unix-like\nsystems caused the daemon to crash upon reload. This has been fixed.\nFor reference below is the original advisory text:\n\n\n\n> \n> Greg MacManus discovered an integer overflow in the smb daemon from\n> Samba, a LanManager like file and printer server for GNU/Linux and\n> Unix-like systems. Requesting a very large number of access control\n> descriptors from the server could exploit the integer overflow, which\n> may result in a buffer overflow which could lead to the execution of\n> arbitrary code with root privileges. Upstream developers have\n> discovered more possible integer overflows that are fixed with this\n> update as well.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.2.3a-15.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 3.0.10-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.\n\n\n",
