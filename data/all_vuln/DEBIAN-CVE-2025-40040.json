Specifically, a VMA which has a valid pointer to vma->vm_userfaultfd_ctx, but no UFFD flags in vma->vm_flags.  The inconsistency is caused in ksm_madvise(): when user calls madvise() with MADV_UNMEARGEABLE on a VMA that is registered for UFFD in MINOR mode, it accidentally clears all flags stored in the upper 32 bits of vma->vm_flags.  Assuming x86_64 kernel build, unsigned long is 64-bit and unsigned int and int are 32-bit wide.  This setup causes the following mishap during the &= ~VM_MERGEABLE assignment.  VM_MERGEABLE is a 32-bit constant of type unsigned int, 0x8000'0000.  After ~ is applied, it becomes 0x7fff'ffff unsigned int, which is then promoted to unsigned long before the & operation.  This promotion fills upper 32 bits with leading 0s, as we're doing unsigned conversion (and even for a signed conversion, this wouldn't help as the leading bit is 0). & operation thus ends up AND-ing vm_flags with 0x0000'0000'7fff'ffff instead of intended 0xffff'ffff'7fff'ffff and hence accidentally clears the upper 32-bits of its value.  Fix it by changing `VM_MERGEABLE` constant to unsigned long, using the BIT() macro.  Note: other VM_* flags are not affected: This only happens to the VM_MERGEABLE flag, as the other VM_* flags are all constants of type int and after ~ operation, they end up with leading 1 and are thus converted to unsigned long with leading 1s.  Note 2: After commit 31defc3b01d9 (\"userfaultfd: remove (VM_)BUG_ON()s\"), this is no longer a kernel BUG, but a WARNING at the same place:  [   45.595973] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 2474 at mm/userfaultfd.c:2067  but the root-cause (flag-drop) remains the same.
