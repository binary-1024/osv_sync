This violates the principle of least privilege and constitutes a classic example of Broken Access Control (OWASP Top 10 A01:2021). Because authorization is not validated at the function level, any authenticated user can perform actions intended only for privileged roles, leading to horizontal or vertical privilege escalation.\n\n### Detail\nThe backend user without permission was still able to list, create, update \"Favourite Output Channel Configuration\" item\n\n### Step to Reproduce the issue\nlogin as Admin (full permission) and clicked \"Favourite Output Channel Configurations\"\n<img width=\"949\" height=\"860\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-12-10 at 8 52 55 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86554e7e-86c1-469f-b09b-5f360c4507dd\" />\nThen, captured and saved the request:\n-List API\n<img width=\"923\" height=\"662\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-12-10 at 8 55 49 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21d90540-7a6b-4555-bbc0-ce74284dda67\" />\n-Create API\n<img width=\"1245\" height=\"783\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-12-10 at 9 01 46 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38b5a771-ad17-459b-84e1-fe83c6d609a1\" />\n-Update API\n<img width=\"1244\" height=\"726\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-12-10 at 9 03 00 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2167d48e-8941-4fff-be07-3050ffa7ad35\" />\n\nNext, login a backend user with no permission\n<img width=\"1219\" height=\"744\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-12-10 at 9 06 12 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b3981bc-4fe0-4c6e-8a5b-24523679ad4c\" />\nThe copy the \"Cookie\" and \"X-Pimcore-Csrf-Token\"\n<img width=\"1902\" height=\"971\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-12-10 at 9 10 47 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f48f27a-6149-49fb-9209-220c2e62c25f\" />\nAfter that, pasted the copied  \"Cookie\" and \"X-Pimcore-Csrf-Token\" to captured request\n- List API\n<img width=\"1135\" height=\"660\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-12-10 at 9 14 47 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32ebdad2-771a-41dd-a4e6-13e8cb8ef201\" />\n- Create API\n<img width=\"1140\" height=\"697\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-12-10 at 9 16 43 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25d5b7a9-5e96-4e7c-94cf-3c9c3d31e7f1\" />\n- Update API\n<img width=\"1144\" height=\"722\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-12-10 at 9 19 00 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02440595-2e10-44a8-9fb7-8eb8f0aab12a\" />\n\n\n### Impact\nSuccessful exploitation allows low-privileged or standard users to view, create, modify that should be restricted to specific administrative or operational roles. Depending on the sensitivity of these configurations (e.g., routing of alerts, reports, or data streams), an attacker could redirect critical outputs, suppress notifications, insert misleading channels, or gain insight into internal workflows. In regulated environments, this may result in compliance violations, operational disruption, or facilitation of further attacks through reconnaissance.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"pimcore/web2print-tools-bundle","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/pimcore/web2print-tools-bundle"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.0.0-RC1"},{"fixed":"6.1.1"}]}],"versions":["v6.0.0","v6.0.0-RC1","v6.1.0"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 6.1","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-4wg4-p27p-5q2r/GHSA-4wg4-p27p-5q2r.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pimcore/web2print-tools-bundle","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/pimcore/web2print-tools-bundle"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.2.2"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","2.0.0","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.2.3","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.7.1","v2.7.2","v3.0.0","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.4.0","v3.4.1","v3.4.2","v3.4.3","v3.4.4","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.10","v4.0.2","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.0.5","v4.0.6","v4.0.7","v4.0.8","v4.0.9","v5.0.0","v5.0.0-BETA1","v5.0.0-BETA2","v5.0.0-RC1","v5.0.0-RC2","v5.0.1","v5.0.2","v5.1.0","v5.1.1","v5.2.0","v5.2.0-RC1","v5.2.1"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 5.2.1","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-4wg4-p27p-5q2r/GHSA-4wg4-p27p-5q2r.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/security/advisories/GHSA-4wg4-p27p-5q2r"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pimcore/web2print-tools/pull/108"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pimcore/web2print-tools/commit/7714452a04b9f9b077752784af4b8d0b05e464a1"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pimcore/web2print-tools/releases/tag/v5.2.2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pimcore/web2print-tools/releases/tag/v6.1.1"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-284"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-15T18:14:17Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
