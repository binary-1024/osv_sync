A pager is a program that displays text files. Other pagers commonly in use are more and pg. Pagers are often used in command-line environments like the Unix shell and the MS-DOS command prompt to display files.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nless through 653 allows OS command execution via a newline character in the name of a file, because quoting is mishandled in filename.c. Exploitation typically requires use with attacker-controlled file names, such as the files extracted from an untrusted archive. Exploitation also requires the LESSOPEN environment variable, but this is set by default in many common cases.(CVE-2024-32487)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"less","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/less&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"590-6.oe2203sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["less-debugsource-590-6.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","less-590-6.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","less-debuginfo-590-6.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["less-help-590-6.oe2203sp1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["less-590-6.oe2203sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["less-debuginfo-590-6.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","less-590-6.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","less-debugsource-590-6.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-1587.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2024-1587"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32487"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
