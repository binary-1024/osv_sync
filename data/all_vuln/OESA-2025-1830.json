The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.Impacted is confidentiality, integrity, and availability.Upgrading to version 1.7.1 eliminates this vulnerability.(CVE-2025-6020)",
