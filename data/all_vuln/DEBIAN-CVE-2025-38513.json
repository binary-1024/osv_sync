{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-38513","published":"2025-08-16T11:15:44Z","modified":"2025-10-13T11:20:03.138813Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-38513"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: zd1211rw: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in zd_mac_tx_to_dev()  There is a potential NULL pointer dereference in zd_mac_tx_to_dev(). For example, the following is possible:      \tT0\t\t\t    \t\tT1 zd_mac_tx_to_dev()   /* len == skb_queue_len(q) */   while (len > ZD_MAC_MAX_ACK_WAITERS) {  \t\t\t\t\t  filter_ack() \t\t\t\t\t    spin_lock_irqsave(&q->lock, flags); \t\t\t\t\t    /* position == skb_queue_len(q) */ \t\t\t\t\t    for (i=1; i<position; i++) \t\t\t\t    \t      skb = __skb_dequeue(q)  \t\t\t\t\t    if (mac->type == NL80211_IFTYPE_AP) \t\t\t\t\t      skb = __skb_dequeue(q); \t\t\t\t\t    spin_unlock_irqrestore(&q->lock, flags);      skb_dequeue() -> NULL  Since there is a small gap between checking skb queue length and skb being unconditionally dequeued in zd_mac_tx_to_dev(), skb_dequeue() can return NULL. Then the pointer is passed to zd_mac_tx_status() where it is dereferenced.  In order to avoid potential NULL pointer dereference due to situations like above, check if skb is not NULL before passing it to zd_mac_tx_status().
