{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-48384","published":"2025-07-08T19:15:42Z","modified":"2025-10-14T04:26:55.840047Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-48384"],"details":"Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When reading a config value, Git strips any trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when the config is later read. When initializing a submodule, if the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location. If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the submodule hooks directory, and the submodule contains an executable post-checkout hook, the script may be unintentionally executed after checkout. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"git","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/git?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:2.30.2-1+deb11u5"}]}],"versions":["1:2.30.2-1","1:2.30.2-1+deb11u1","1:2.30.2-1+deb11u2","1:2.30.2-1+deb11u3","1:2.30.2-1+deb11u4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-48384.json"}},{"package":{"name":"git","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/git?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:2.39.2+next.20230215-1","1:2.39.2-1.1","1:2.39.5-0+deb12u1","1:2.39.5-0+deb12u2","1:2.40.0+next.20230313-1","1:2.40.0+next.20230319-1","1:2.40.0-1","1:2.40.0-1+alpha.1","1:2.40.1+next.20230424-1","1:2.40.1+next.20230427-1","1:2.40.1-1","1:2.40.1-1+alpha.1","1:2.42.0-1","1:2.43.0+next.20231120-1","1:2.43.0+next.20240104-1","1:2.43.0-1","1:2.43.0-1+alpha.2","1:2.45.1+next.20240516-1","1:2.45.1-1","1:2.45.2+next.20240614-1","1:2.45.2-1","1:2.45.2-1+alpha.1","1:2.45.2-1.1","1:2.45.2-1.1+alpha.1","1:2.45.2-1.2","1:2.45.2-1.3","1:2.47.1-1","1:2.47.2-0.1","1:2.47.2-0.2","1:2.48.0~rc1+next.20250101-1","1:2.49.0+next.20250314-1","1:2.49.0-1","1:2.49.0-2","1:2.49.0-3","1:2.50.0+next.20250615-1","1:2.50.0-1","1:2.50.0~rc0+next.20250528-1","1:2.50.1-0.1","1:2.51.0+next.20250825-1","1:2.51.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-48384.json"}},{"package":{"name":"git","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/git?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:2.47.3-0+deb13u1"}]}],"versions":["1:2.47.2-0.2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-48384.json"}},{"package":{"name":"git","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/git?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:2.50.1-0.1"}]}],"versions":["1:2.47.2-0.2","1:2.48.0~rc1+next.20250101-1","1:2.49.0+next.20250314-1","1:2.49.0-1","1:2.49.0-2","1:2.49.0-3","1:2.50.0+next.20250615-1","1:2.50.0-1","1:2.50.0~rc0+next.20250528-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-48384.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-48384"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
