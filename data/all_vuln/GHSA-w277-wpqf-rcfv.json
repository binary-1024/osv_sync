This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nThe `Webhook::verify` function incorrectly compared signatures of different lengths - the two signatures would only be compared up to the length of the shorter signature. This allowed an attacker to pass in `v1,` as the signature, which would always pass verification.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"svix","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/svix"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.17.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/02/GHSA-w277-wpqf-rcfv/GHSA-w277-wpqf-rcfv.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1190"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/commit/958821bd3b956d1436af65f70a0964d4ffb7daf6"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0010.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-02-06T20:30:14Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"}}
