  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: mctp: unshare packets when reassembling\n\nEnsure that the frag_list used for reassembly isn't shared with other\npackets. This avoids incorrect reassembly when packets are cloned, and\nprevents a memory leak due to circular references between fragments and\ntheir skb_shared_info.\n\nThe upcoming MCTP-over-USB driver uses skb_clone which can trigger the\nproblem - other MCTP drivers don't share SKBs.\n\nA kunit test is added to reproduce the issue.",
