Prior to 2.7.1, GuardDog's safe_extract() function does not validate decompressed file sizes when extracting ZIP archives (wheels, eggs), allowing attackers to cause denial of service through zip bombs. A malicious package can consume gigabytes of disk space from a few megabytes of compressed data. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.7.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/datadog/guarddog","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2309037b57d6f188a2411dc2c43a5224451463e6"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.10","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.1.7","v0.1.8","v0.1.9","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.11.0","v1.11.1","v1.11.2","v1.2","v1.2.1","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.5.5","v1.5.6","v1.5.7","v1.5.8","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.9.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.0.6","v2.1.0","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.7.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22870.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22870.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/DataDog/guarddog/commit/c3fb07b4838945f42497e78b7a02bcfb1e63969b"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/DataDog/guarddog/security/advisories/GHSA-ffj4-jq7m-9g6v"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22870"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-409"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22870.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
