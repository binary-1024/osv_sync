If a\nuser were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with\nscripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct\ncross-site request forgery (XSRF) attacks.

If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application\ncrash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking\nThunderbird.
