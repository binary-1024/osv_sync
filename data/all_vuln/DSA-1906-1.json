  "details": "\nSecurity support for clamav, an anti-virus utility for Unix, has been\ndiscontinued for the stable distribution (lenny) and the oldstable\ndistribution (etch). Clamav Upstream has stopped supporting the\nreleases in etch and lenny. Also, it is not easily possible to receive\nsignature updates for the virus scanner with our released versions\nanymore.\n\n\nWe recommend that all clamav users consider switching to the\nversion in debian-volatile, which receives regular updates and security\nsupport on a best effort basis.\n\n\nFor more information on debian-volatile, please visit \n[https://www.debian.org/volatile/]($(HOME)/volatile/).\n\n\n",
