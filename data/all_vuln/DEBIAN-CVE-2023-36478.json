{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-36478","published":"2023-10-10T17:15:11Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:17:45.057645Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-36478"],"details":"Eclipse Jetty provides a web server and servlet container. In versions 11.0.0 through 11.0.15, 10.0.0 through 10.0.15, and 9.0.0 through 9.4.52, an integer overflow in `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for HTTP/2 HPACK header values to exceed their size limit. `MetaDataBuilder.java` determines if a header name or value exceeds the size limit, and throws an exception if the limit is exceeded. However, when length is very large and huffman is true, the multiplication by 4 in line 295 will overflow, and length will become negative. `(_size+length)` will now be negative, and the check on line 296 will not be triggered. Furthermore, `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for user-entered HPACK header value sizes to be negative, potentially leading to a very large buffer allocation later on when the user-entered size is multiplied by 2. This means that if a user provides a negative length value (or, more precisely, a length value which, when multiplied by the 4/3 fudge factor, is negative), and this length value is a very large positive number when multiplied by 2, then the user can cause a very large buffer to be allocated on the server. Users of HTTP/2 can be impacted by a remote denial of service attack. The issue has been fixed in versions 11.0.16, 10.0.16, and 9.4.53. There are no known workarounds.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"jetty9","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/jetty9?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.4.50-4+deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["9.4.39-3","9.4.39-3+deb11u1","9.4.39-3+deb11u2","9.4.44-1","9.4.44-2","9.4.44-3","9.4.44-4","9.4.45-1","9.4.46-1","9.4.48-1","9.4.49-1","9.4.49-1.1","9.4.50-1","9.4.50-1~bpo11+1","9.4.50-2","9.4.50-3","9.4.50-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-36478.json"}},{"package":{"name":"jetty9","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/jetty9?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.4.50-4+deb12u2"}]}],"versions":["9.4.50-4","9.4.50-4+deb12u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-36478.json"}},{"package":{"name":"jetty9","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/jetty9?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.4.53-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-36478.json"}},{"package":{"name":"jetty9","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/jetty9?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.4.53-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-36478.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-36478"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
