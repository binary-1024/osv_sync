{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2012-6708","published":"2018-01-18T23:29:00Z","modified":"2024-11-21T01:46:43Z","aliases":["GHSA-2pqj-h3vj-pqgw"],"related":["SUSE-SU-2020:0737-1","openSUSE-SU-2020:0395-1"],"details":"jQuery before 1.9.0 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The jQuery(strInput) function does not differentiate selectors from HTML in a reliable fashion. In vulnerable versions, jQuery determined whether the input was HTML by looking for the '<' character anywhere in the string, giving attackers more flexibility when attempting to construct a malicious payload. In fixed versions, jQuery only deems the input to be HTML if it explicitly starts with the '<' character, limiting exploitability only to attackers who can control the beginning of a string, which is far less common.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102792"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11290"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/05531fc4080ae24070930d15ae0cea7ae056457d"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://help.ecostruxureit.com/display/public/UADCE725/Security+fixes+in+StruxureWare+Data+Center+Expert+v7.6.0"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:jquery:20120206"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-03/msg00041.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153237/RetireJS-CORS-Issue-Script-Execution.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/161972/Linksys-EA7500-2.0.8.194281-Cross-Site-Scripting.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/519eb0fd45642dcecd9ff74cb3e71c20a4753f7d82e2f07864b5108f%40%3Cdev.drill.apache.org%3E"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/b0656d359c7d40ec9f39c8cc61bca66802ef9a2a12ee199f5b0c1442%40%3Cdev.drill.apache.org%3E"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/f9bc3e55f4e28d1dcd1a69aae6d53e609a758e34d2869b4d798e13cc%40%3Cissues.drill.apache.org%3E"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
