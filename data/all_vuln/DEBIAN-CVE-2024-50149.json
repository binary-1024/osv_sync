  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/xe: Don't free job in TDR  Freeing job in TDR is not safe as TDR can pass the run_job thread resulting in UAF. It is only safe for free job to naturally be called by the scheduler. Rather free job in TDR, add to pending list.  (cherry picked from commit ea2f6a77d0c40d97f4a4dc93fee4afe15d94926d)",
