The vulnerability is limited to the `includeInheritedProps` mode (if version >= 0.11.0 is used), which has to be explicitly enabled by creating a new instance of `object-path` and setting the option `includeInheritedProps: true`, or by using the default `withInheritedProps` instance. The default operating mode is not affected by the vulnerability if version >= 0.11.0 is used. Any usage of `set()` in versions < 0.11.0 is vulnerable. The issue is fixed in object-path version 0.11.5 As a workaround, don't use the `includeInheritedProps: true` options or the `withInheritedProps` instance if using a version >= 0.11.0.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"node-object-path","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-object-path?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.11.5-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2020-15256.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-object-path","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-object-path?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.11.5-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2020-15256.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-object-path","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-object-path?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.11.5-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2020-15256.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-object-path","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-object-path?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.11.5-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2020-15256.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-15256"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
