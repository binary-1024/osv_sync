  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix overloading of MEM_UNINIT's meaning\n\nLonial reported an issue in the BPF verifier where check_mem_size_reg()\nhas the following code:\n\n    if (!tnum_is_const(reg->var_off))\n        /* For unprivileged variable accesses, disable raw\n         * mode so that the program is required to\n         * initialize all the memory that the helper could\n         * just partially fill up.\n         */\n         meta = NULL;\n\nThis means that writes are not checked when the register containing the\nsize of the passed buffer has not a fixed size. Through this bug, a BPF\nprogram can write to a map which is marked as read-only, for example,\n.rodata global maps.\n\nThe problem is that MEM_UNINIT's initial meaning that \"the passed buffer\nto the BPF helper does not need to be initialized\" which was added back\nin commit 435faee1aae9 (\"bpf, verifier: add ARG_PTR_TO_RAW_STACK type\")\ngot overloaded over time with \"the passed buffer is being written to\".\n\nThe problem however is that checks such as the above which were added later\nvia 06c1c049721a (\"bpf: allow helpers access to variable memory\") set meta\nto NULL in order force the user to always initialize the passed buffer to\nthe helper. Due to the current double meaning of MEM_UNINIT, this bypasses\nverifier write checks to the memory (not boundary checks though) and only\nassumes the latter memory is read instead.\n\nFix this by reverting MEM_UNINIT back to its original meaning, and having\nMEM_WRITE as an annotation to BPF helpers in order to then trigger the\nBPF verifier checks for writing to memory.\n\nSome notes: check_arg_pair_ok() ensures that for ARG_CONST_SIZE{,_OR_ZERO}\nwe can access fn->arg_type[arg - 1] since it must contain a preceding\nARG_PTR_TO_MEM. For check_mem_reg() the meta argument can be removed\naltogether since we do check both BPF_READ and BPF_WRITE. Same for the\nequivalent check_kfunc_mem_size_reg().",
