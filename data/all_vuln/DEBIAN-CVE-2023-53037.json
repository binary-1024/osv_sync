  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: mpi3mr: Bad drive in topology results kernel crash  When the SAS Transport Layer support is enabled and a device exposed to the OS by the driver fails INQUIRY commands, the driver frees up the memory allocated for an internal HBA port data structure. However, in some places, the reference to the freed memory is not cleared. When the firmware sends the Device Info change event for the same device again, the freed memory is accessed and that leads to memory corruption and OS crash.",
