IPsec is the Internet Protocol Security and uses strong cryptography to provide both authentication and encryption services.  These services allow you to build secure tunnels through untrusted networks.  Everything passing through the untrusted net is encrypted by the ipsec gateway machine and decrypted by the gateway at the other end of the tunnel.  The resulting tunnel is a virtual private network or VPN.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nThe Libreswan Project was notified of an issue causing libreswan to restart under some IKEv2 retransmit scenarios when a connection is configured to use PreSharedKeys (authby=secret) and the connection cannot find a matching configured secret. When such a connection is automatically added on startup using the auto= keyword, it can cause repeated crashes leading to a Denial of Service.(CVE-2024-2357)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libreswan","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/libreswan&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.14-1.oe2203sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libreswan-4.14-1.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","libreswan-help-4.14-1.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","libreswan-debugsource-4.14-1.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","libreswan-debuginfo-4.14-1.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["libreswan-4.14-1.oe2203sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libreswan-debuginfo-4.14-1.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","libreswan-4.14-1.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","libreswan-debugsource-4.14-1.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","libreswan-help-4.14-1.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-1409.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2024-1409"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-2357"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Low"}}
