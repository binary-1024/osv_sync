  "details": "Updated java-1.7.0 packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nAn off-by-one flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the font\nparsing code in the 2D component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted font file\ncould possibly cause the Java Virtual Machine to execute arbitrary code,\nallowing an untrusted Java application or applet to bypass Java sandbox\nrestrictions (CVE-2015-0469).\n\nA flaw was found in the way the Hotspot component in OpenJDK handled\nphantom references. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this\nflaw to corrupt the Java Virtual Machine memory and, possibly, execute\narbitrary code, bypassing Java sandbox restrictions (CVE-2015-0460).\n\nA flaw was found in the way the JSSE component in OpenJDK parsed X.509\ncertificate options. A specially crafted certificate could cause JSSE to\nraise an exception, possibly causing an application using JSSE to exit\nunexpectedly (CVE-2015-0488).\n\nA flaw was discovered in the Beans component in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java\napplication or applet could use this flaw to bypass certain Java sandbox\nrestrictions (CVE-2015-0477).\n\nA directory traversal flaw was found in the way the jar tool extracted JAR\narchive files. A specially crafted JAR archive could cause jar to overwrite\narbitrary files writable by the user running jar when the archive was\nextracted (CVE-2005-1080, CVE-2015-0480).\n\nIt was found that the RSA implementation in the JCE component in OpenJDK\ndid not follow recommended practices for implementing RSA signatures\n(CVE-2015-0478).\n",
