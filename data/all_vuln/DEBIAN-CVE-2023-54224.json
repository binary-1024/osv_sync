{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-54224","published":"2025-12-30T13:16:10.743Z","modified":"2025-12-31T11:10:27.292667Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-54224"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: fix lockdep splat and potential deadlock after failure running delayed items  When running delayed items we are holding a delayed node's mutex and then we will attempt to modify a subvolume btree to insert/update/delete the delayed items. However if have an error during the insertions for example, btrfs_insert_delayed_items() may return with a path that has locked extent buffers (a leaf at the very least), and then we attempt to release the delayed node at __btrfs_run_delayed_items(), which requires taking the delayed node's mutex, causing an ABBA type of deadlock. This was reported by syzbot and the lockdep splat is the following:    WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected   6.5.0-rc7-syzkaller-00024-g93f5de5f648d #0 Not tainted
