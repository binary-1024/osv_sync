This issue has been addressed in version 1.1.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are several ways to workaround or lower the probability of this bug affecting a given deployment. 1: use a reasonably high `POLL_TIMEOUT` setting, like the default. 2: use separate libmemcached connections for unrelated data. 3: do not re-use libmemcached connections in an unknown state.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"memcached","ecosystem":"Bitnami","purl":"pkg:bitnami/memcached"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.0.18"},{"fixed":"1.1.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/bitnami/vulndb/tree/main/data/memcached/BIT-memcached-2023-27478.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/awesomized/libmemcached/commit/48dcc61a"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/awesomized/libmemcached/releases/tag/1.1.4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/awesomized/libmemcached/security/advisories/GHSA-wwmh-39wj-fx59"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/php-memcached-dev/php-memcached/issues/531"}],"database_specific":{"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:awesome:libmemcached:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"severity":"Medium"}}
