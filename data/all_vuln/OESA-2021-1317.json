The vulnerability is related to the injection of HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader tag. The newline character in the ExposeHeader tag in the CORS configuration file generates a header injection in the response when the CORS request is made. In addition, the prior bug fix for CVE-2020-10753 did not account for the use of \\r as a header separator, thus a new flaw has been created.(CVE-2021-3524)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the Ceph Object Gateway, where it supports request sent by an anonymous user in Amazon S3. This flaw could lead to potential XSS attacks due to the lack of proper neutralization of untrusted input.(CVE-2020-1760)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the Red Hat Ceph Storage RadosGW (Ceph Object Gateway). The vulnerability is related to the injection of HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader tag. The newline character in the ExposeHeader tag in the CORS configuration file generates a header injection in the response when the CORS request is made. Ceph versions 3.x and 4.x are vulnerable to this issue.(CVE-2020-10753)\n\nUser credentials can be manipulated and stolen by Native CephFS consumers of OpenStack Manila, resulting in potential privilege escalation. An Open Stack Manila user can request access to a share to an arbitrary cephx user, including existing users. The access key is retrieved via the interface drivers. Then, all users of the requesting OpenStack project can view the access key. This enables the attacker to target any resource that the user has access to. This can be done to even admin users, compromising the ceph administrator. This flaw affects Ceph versions prior to 14.2.16, 15.x prior to 15.2.8, and 16.x prior to 16.2.0.(CVE-2020-27781)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ceph","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/ceph&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"12.2.8-15.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["ceph-fuse-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","rados-objclass-devel-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python-rados-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-test-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-base-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-cephfs-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-debuginfo-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-rgw-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","librbd-devel-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libradosstriper-devel-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-resource-agents-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python-rgw-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libcephfs-devel-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-mgr-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-selinux-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-rbd-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libradosstriper1-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-rados-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python-rbd-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","librgw2-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","librados-devel-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-ceph-argparse-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","rbd-fuse-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libcephfs2-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","rbd-mirror-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","librbd1-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","rbd-nbd-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python-ceph-compat-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","librados2-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-radosgw-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-debugsource-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python-cephfs-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-mon-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-common-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","librgw-devel-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-mds-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-osd-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["ceph-12.2.8-15.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python-cephfs-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","ceph-base-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-rbd-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-ceph-argparse-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-rados-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","ceph-resource-agents-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","ceph-mds-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","ceph-selinux-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","ceph-fuse-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python-rados-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-cephfs-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libradosstriper1-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","ceph-radosgw-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","ceph-osd-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libcephfs-devel-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","librados-devel-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","ceph-common-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","ceph-mgr-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","rbd-nbd-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","rbd-fuse-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","ceph-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","librbd1-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python-rgw-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python-rbd-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","librbd-devel-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","rbd-mirror-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","rados-objclass-devel-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","ceph-mon-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python-ceph-compat-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","librgw2-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","ceph-debuginfo-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","ceph-debugsource-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","librados2-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-rgw-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","librgw-devel-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libradosstriper-devel-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libcephfs2-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","ceph-test-12.2.8-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1317.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ceph","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/ceph&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"12.2.8-15.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["librgw-devel-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-ceph-argparse-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","librbd1-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","librados-devel-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-fuse-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-debugsource-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-selinux-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","rbd-mirror-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-test-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-radosgw-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python-rbd-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-base-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-rbd-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libcephfs2-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","librgw2-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","rados-objclass-devel-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","librados2-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libradosstriper-devel-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libradosstriper1-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-cephfs-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-osd-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python-rgw-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python-cephfs-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-mon-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python-ceph-compat-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-rgw-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ceph-debuginfo-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libcephfs-devel-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","librbd-devel-12.2.8-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","rbd-nbd-12.2.8-15.o
