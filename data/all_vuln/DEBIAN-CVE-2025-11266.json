{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-11266","published":"2025-12-12T21:15:51.653Z","modified":"2025-12-23T04:15:16.565008Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-11266"],"details":"An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the Grassroots DICOM library (GDCM). The issue is triggered during parsing of a malformed DICOM file containing encapsulated PixelData fragments (compressed image data stored as multiple fragments). This vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault caused by an out-of-bounds memory access due to unsigned integer underflow in buffer indexing. It is exploitable via file input, simply opening a crafted malicious DICOM file is sufficient to trigger the crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gdcm","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gdcm?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.0.10-1","3.0.10-1~bpo11+1","3.0.11-1","3.0.12-1","3.0.13-1","3.0.13-2","3.0.13-2~bpo11+1","3.0.13-3","3.0.14-1","3.0.16-1","3.0.17-1","3.0.17-1~bpo11+1","3.0.17-2","3.0.17-3","3.0.17-4","3.0.17-4~bpo11+1","3.0.17-5","3.0.20-1","3.0.20-2","3.0.20-3","3.0.20-3+hurd.1","3.0.21-1","3.0.21-2","3.0.22-1","3.0.22-2","3.0.22-2.1","3.0.22-2.1~exp1","3.0.22-3","3.0.24-1","3.0.24-1+hurd.1","3.0.24-2","3.0.24-3","3.0.24-3+hurd.1","3.0.24-4","3.0.24-5","3.0.24-5+hurd.1","3.0.24-5+hurd.2","3.0.24-6","3.0.24-7","3.0.24-8","3.0.8-2","3.0.8-3","3.0.8-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-11266.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gdcm","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gdcm?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.0.21-1","3.0.21-2","3.0.22-1","3.0.22-2","3.0.22-2.1","3.0.22-2.1~exp1","3.0.22-3","3.0.24-1","3.0.24-1+hurd.1","3.0.24-2","3.0.24-3","3.0.24-3+hurd.1","3.0.24-4","3.0.24-5","3.0.24-5+hurd.1","3.0.24-5+hurd.2","3.0.24-6","3.0.24-7","3.0.24-8"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-11266.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gdcm","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gdcm?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.0.24-5","3.0.24-5+hurd.1","3.0.24-5+hurd.2","3.0.24-6","3.0.24-7","3.0.24-8"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-11266.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gdcm","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gdcm?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.0.24-8"}]}],"versions":["3.0.24-5","3.0.24-5+hurd.1","3.0.24-5+hurd.2","3.0.24-6","3.0.24-7"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-11266.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-11266"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:L/VI:L/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
