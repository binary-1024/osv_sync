{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-0563","published":"2022-02-21T19:15:08Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:16:46.891866Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-0563"],"details":"A flaw was found in the util-linux chfn and chsh utilities when compiled with Readline support. The Readline library uses an \"INPUTRC\" environment variable to get a path to the library config file. When the library cannot parse the specified file, it prints an error message containing data from the file. This flaw allows an unprivileged user to read root-owned files, potentially leading to privilege escalation. This flaw affects util-linux versions prior to 2.37.4.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"util-linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/util-linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.36.1-8","2.36.1-8+deb11u1","2.36.1-8+deb11u2","2.37.2-1","2.37.2-2","2.37.2-3","2.37.2-4","2.37.2-5","2.37.2-6","2.37.3-1","2.38-1","2.38-2","2.38-3","2.38-4","2.38-4+exp1","2.38-4+exp2","2.38-5","2.38-5+exp1","2.38-6","2.38.1-1","2.38.1-1.1","2.38.1-2","2.38.1-3","2.38.1-4","2.38.1-4+exp1","2.38.1-5","2.38.1-5+loong64","2.38.1-6","2.38~rc1-1","2.38~rc2-1","2.39.1-1","2.39.1-2","2.39.1-3","2.39.1-4","2.39.2-1","2.39.2-2","2.39.2-2.1","2.39.2-2.2","2.39.2-3","2.39.2-4","2.39.2-5","2.39.2-6","2.39.3-1","2.39.3-10","2.39.3-11","2.39.3-2","2.39.3-3","2.39.3-4","2.39.3-5","2.39.3-6","2.39.3-6.1","2.39.3-6.1~exp1","2.39.3-7","2.39.3-8","2.39.3-9","2.40-1","2.40-2","2.40-3","2.40-4","2.40-5","2.40-6","2.40-7","2.40-8","2.40.1-1","2.40.1-2","2.40.1-3","2.40.1-4","2.40.1-4+hurd.1","2.40.1-6","2.40.1-7","2.40.1-8","2.40.1-8.1","2.40.1-9","2.40.2-1","2.40.2-10","2.40.2-11","2.40.2-12","2.40.2-12+hurd.1","2.40.2-13","2.40.2-14","2.40.2-2","2.40.2-3","2.40.2-4","2.40.2-5","2.40.2-6","2.40.2-7","2.40.2-8","2.40.2-9","2.40.3-1","2.40.4-1","2.40.4-2","2.40.4-3","2.40.4-4","2.40.4-5","2.40~rc2-1","2.40~rc2-2","2.40~rc2-3","2.40~rc2-4","2.40~rc2-5","2.40~rc2-6","2.40~rc2-7","2.40~rc2-8","2.41-1","2.41-2","2.41-3","2.41-4","2.41-5","2.41.1-1","2.41.1-2","2.41.1-3","2.41.1-4","2.41.2-1","2.41.2-2","2.41.2-3","2.41~rc1-1","2.41~rc1-2","2.41~rc2-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-0563.json"}},{"package":{"name":"util-linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/util-linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.38.1-5","2.38.1-5+deb12u1","2.38.1-5+deb12u2","2.38.1-5+deb12u3","2.38.1-5+loong64","2.38.1-6","2.39.1-1","2.39.1-2","2.39.1-3","2.39.1-4","2.39.2-1","2.39.2-2","2.39.2-2.1","2.39.2-2.2","2.39.2-3","2.39.2-4","2.39.2-5","2.39.2-6","2.39.3-1","2.39.3-10","2.39.3-11","2.39.3-2","2.39.3-3","2.39.3-4","2.39.3-5","2.39.3-6","2.39.3-6.1","2.39.3-6.1~exp1","2.39.3-7","2.39.3-8","2.39.3-9","2.40-1","2.40-2","2.40-3","2.40-4","2.40-5","2.40-6","2.40-7","2.40-8","2.40.1-1","2.40.1-2","2.40.1-3","2.40.1-4","2.40.1-4+hurd.1","2.40.1-6","2.40.1-7","2.40.1-8","2.40.1-8.1","2.40.1-9","2.40.2-1","2.40.2-10","2.40.2-11","2.40.2-12","2.40.2-12+hurd.1","2.40.2-13","2.40.2-14","2.40.2-2","2.40.2-3","2.40.2-4","2.40.2-5","2.40.2-6","2.40.2-7","2.40.2-8","2.40.2-9","2.40.3-1","2.40.4-1","2.40.4-2","2.40.4-3","2.40.4-4","2.40.4-5","2.40~rc2-1","2.40~rc2-2","2.40~rc2-3","2.40~rc2-4","2.40~rc2-5","2.40~rc2-6","2.40~rc2-7","2.40~rc2-8","2.41-1","2.41-2","2.41-3","2.41-4","2.41-5","2.41.1-1","2.41.1-2","2.41.1-3","2.41.1-4","2.41.2-1","2.41.2-2","2.41.2-3","2.41~rc1-1","2.41~rc1-2","2.41~rc2-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-0563.json"}},{"package":{"name":"util-linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/util-linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.41-5","2.41.1-1","2.41.1-2","2.41.1-3","2.41.1-4","2.41.2-1","2.41.2-2","2.41.2-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-0563.json"}},{"package":{"name":"util-linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/util-linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.41-5","2.41.1-1","2.41.1-2","2.41.1-3","2.41.1-4","2.41.2-1","2.41.2-2","2.41.2-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-0563.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0563"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
