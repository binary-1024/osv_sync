Because the kernel executes XRSTOR with the guest's XFD, saving XSTATE_BV[i]=1 with XFD[i]=1 will cause XRSTOR to #NM and panic the kernel.  E.g. if fpu_update_guest_xfd() sets XFD without clearing XSTATE_BV:    ------------[ cut here ]------------   WARNING: arch/x86/kernel/traps.c:1524 at exc_device_not_available+0x101/0x110, CPU#29: amx_test/848   Modules linked in: kvm_intel kvm irqbypass   CPU: 29 UID: 1000 PID: 848 Comm: amx_test Not tainted 6.19.0-rc2-ffa07f7fd437-x86_amx_nm_xfd_non_init-vm #171 NONE   Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 0.0.0 02/06/2015   RIP: 0010:exc_device_not_available+0x101/0x110   Call Trace:    <TASK>    asm_exc_device_not_available+0x1a/0x20   RIP: 0010:restore_fpregs_from_fpstate+0x36/0x90    switch_fpu_return+0x4a/0xb0    kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x1245/0x1e40 [kvm]    kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x2c3/0x8f0 [kvm]    __x64_sys_ioctl+0x8f/0xd0    do_syscall_64+0x62/0x940    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53    </TASK>   ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---  This can happen if the guest executes WRMSR(MSR_IA32_XFD) to set XFD[18] = 1, and a host IRQ triggers kernel_fpu_begin() prior to the vmexit handler's call to fpu_update_guest_xfd().  and if userspace stuffs XSTATE_BV[i]=1 via KVM_SET_XSAVE:    ------------[ cut here ]------------   WARNING: arch/x86/kernel/traps.c:1524 at exc_device_not_available+0x101/0x110, CPU#14: amx_test/867   Modules linked in: kvm_intel kvm irqbypass   CPU: 14 UID: 1000 PID: 867 Comm: amx_test Not tainted 6.19.0-rc2-2dace9faccd6-x86_amx_nm_xfd_non_init-vm #168 NONE   Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 0.0.0 02/06/2015   RIP: 0010:exc_device_not_available+0x101/0x110   Call Trace:    <TASK>    asm_exc_device_not_available+0x1a/0x20   RIP: 0010:restore_fpregs_from_fpstate+0x36/0x90    fpu_swap_kvm_fpstate+0x6b/0x120    kvm_load_guest_fpu+0x30/0x80 [kvm]    kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x85/0x1e40 [kvm]    kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x2c3/0x8f0 [kvm]    __x64_sys_ioctl+0x8f/0xd0    do_syscall_64+0x62/0x940    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53    </TASK>   ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---  The new behavior is consistent with the AMX architecture.  Per Intel's SDM, XSAVE saves XSTATE_BV as '0' for components that are disabled via XFD (and non-compacted XSAVE saves the initial configuration of the state component):    If XSAVE, XSAVEC, XSAVEOPT, or XSAVES is saving the state component i,   the instruction does not generate #NM when XCR0[i] = IA32_XFD[i] = 1;   instead, it operates as if XINUSE[i] = 0 (and the state component was   in its initial state): it saves bit i of XSTATE_BV field of the XSAVE   header as 0; in addition, XSAVE saves the initial configuration of the   state component (the other instructions do not save state component i).  Alternatively, KVM could always do XRSTOR with XFD=0, e.g. by using a constant XFD based on the set of enabled features when XSAVEing for a struct fpu_guest.  However, having XSTATE_BV[i]=1 for XFD-disabled features can only happen in the above interrupt case, or in similar scenarios involving preemption on preemptible kernels, because fpu_swap_kvm_fpstate()'s call to save_fpregs_to_fpstate() saves the outgoing FPU state with the current XFD; and that is (on all but the first WRMSR to XFD) the guest XFD.  Therefore, XFD can only go out of sync with XSTATE_BV in the above interrupt case, or in similar scenarios involving preemption on preemptible kernels, and it we can consider it (de facto) part of KVM ABI that KVM_GET_XSAVE returns XSTATE_BV[i]=0 for XFD-disabled features.
