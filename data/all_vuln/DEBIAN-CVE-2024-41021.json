Therefore we do not expect to see VM_FAULT_HWPOISON in do_exception().  However, since commit af19487f00f3 (\"mm: make PTE_MARKER_SWAPIN_ERROR more general\"), it is possible to see VM_FAULT_HWPOISON in combination with PTE_MARKER_POISONED, even on architectures that do not support HWPOISON otherwise. In this case, we will end up on the BUG() in do_exception().  Fix this by treating VM_FAULT_HWPOISON the same as VM_FAULT_SIGBUS, similar to x86 when MEMORY_FAILURE is not configured. Also print unexpected fault flags, for easier debugging.  Note that VM_FAULT_HWPOISON_LARGE is not expected, because s390 cannot support swap entries on other levels than PTE level.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.9.12-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-41021.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.9.12-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-41021.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-41021"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
