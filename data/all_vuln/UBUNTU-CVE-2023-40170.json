Improper cross-site credential checks on `/files/` URLs could allow exposure of certain file contents, or accessing files when opening untrusted files via \"Open image in new tab\". This issue has been addressed in commit `87a49272728` which has been included in release `2.7.2`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may use the lower performance `--ContentsManager.files_handler_class=jupyter_server.files.handlers.FilesHandler`, which implements the correct checks.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"jupyter-server","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:22.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/jupyter-server@1.13.1-1?arch=source&distro=jammy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.2-1","1.13.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"jupyter-server","binary_version":"1.13.1-1"},{"binary_name":"python3-jupyter-server","binary_version":"1.13.1-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2023/UBUNTU-CVE-2023-40170.json"}},{"package":{"name":"jupyter-server","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/jupyter-server@1.23.3-2?arch=source&distro=noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.23.3-1","1.23.3-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"jupyter-server","binary_version":"1.23.3-2"},{"binary_name":"python3-jupyter-server","binary_version":"1.23.3-2"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2023/UBUNTU-CVE-2023-40170.json"}},{"package":{"name":"jupyter-server","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.10","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/jupyter-server@2.15.0-1?arch=source&distro=questing"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.14.2-5","2.15.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"jupyter-server","binary_version":"2.15.0-1"},{"binary_name":"python3-jupyter-server","binary_version":"2.15.0-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2023/UBUNTU-CVE-2023-40170.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2023-40170"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/security/advisories/GHSA-64x5-55rw-9974"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/commit/87a4927272819f0b1cae1afa4c8c86ee2da002fd"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-40170"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"},{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
