However, currently mlx5 driver sets the above ops without regards to its migration caps.  This might lead to unexpected usage/Oops if user space may call to the above ops even if the driver doesn't support migration. As for example, the migration state_mutex is not initialized in that case.  The cleanest way to manage that seems to split the migration ops from the main device ops, this will let the driver setting them separately from the main ops when it's applicable.  As part of that, validate ops construction on registration and include a check for VFIO_MIGRATION_STOP_COPY since the uAPI claims it must be set in migration_flags.  HISI driver was changed as well to match this scheme.  This scheme may enable down the road to come with some extra group of ops (e.g. DMA log) that can be set without regards to the other options based on driver caps.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50117.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50117.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50117.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-50117"}]}
