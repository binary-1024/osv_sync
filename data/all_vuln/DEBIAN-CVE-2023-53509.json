{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53509","published":"2025-10-01T12:15:54Z","modified":"2025-10-02T09:25:19.246443Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-53509"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  qed: allow sleep in qed_mcp_trace_dump()  By default, qed_mcp_cmd_and_union() delays 10us at a time in a loop that can run 500K times, so calls to qed_mcp_nvm_rd_cmd() may block the current thread for over 5s. We observed thread scheduling delays over 700ms in production, with stacktraces pointing to this code as the culprit.  qed_mcp_trace_dump() is called from ethtool, so sleeping is permitted. It already can sleep in qed_mcp_halt(), which calls qed_mcp_cmd(). Add a \"can sleep\" parameter to qed_find_nvram_image() and qed_nvram_read() so they can sleep during qed_mcp_trace_dump(). qed_mcp_trace_get_meta_info() and qed_mcp_trace_read_meta(), called only by qed_mcp_trace_dump(), allow these functions to sleep. I can't tell if the other caller (qed_grc_dump_mcp_hw_dump()) can sleep, so keep b_can_sleep set to false when it calls these functions.  An example stacktrace from a custom warning we added to the kernel showing a thread that has not scheduled despite long needing resched: [ 2745.362925,17] ------------[ cut here ]------------ [ 2745.362941,17] WARNING: CPU: 23 PID: 5640 at arch/x86/kernel/irq.c:233 do_IRQ+0x15e/0x1a0() [ 2745.362946,17] Thread not rescheduled for 744 ms after irq 99 [ 2745.362956,17] Modules linked in: ...
