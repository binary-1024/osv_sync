If L1 (or host userspace) modifies the I/O permission\nbitmaps during the exit to userspace,  KVM will treat the access as being\nintercepted despite already having emulated the I/O access.\n\nPivot on EMULTYPE_NO_DECODE to detect that KVM is completing emulation.\nOf the three users of EMULTYPE_NO_DECODE, only complete_emulated_io() (the\nintended \"recipient\") can reach the code in question.  gp_interception()'s\nuse is mutually exclusive with is_guest_mode(), and\ncomplete_emulated_insn_gp() unconditionally pairs EMULTYPE_NO_DECODE with\nEMULTYPE_SKIP.\n\nThe bad behavior was detected by a syzkaller program that toggles port I/O\ninterception during the userspace I/O exit, ultimately resulting in a WARN\non vcpu->arch.pio.count being non-zero due to KVM no completing emulation\nof the I/O instruction.\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 23 PID: 1083 at arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:8039 emulator_pio_in_out+0x154/0x170 [kvm]\n  Modules linked in: kvm_intel kvm irqbypass\n  CPU: 23 UID: 1000 PID: 1083 Comm:
