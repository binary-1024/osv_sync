In versions 1.2.7 and below, 1.3.0-rc.1 through 1.3.1, 1.4.0-rc.1 and 1.4.0-rc.2 files, runc would not perform sufficient verification that the source of the bind-mount (i.e., the container's /dev/null) was actually a real /dev/null inode when using the container's /dev/null to mask. This exposes two methods of attack:  an arbitrary mount gadget, leading to host information disclosure, host denial of service, container escape, or a bypassing of maskedPaths. This issue is fixed in versions 1.2.8, 1.3.3 and 1.4.0-rc.3.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"runc","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/runc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0+ds1-1","1.0.0~rc93+ds1-5","1.0.0~rc93+ds1-5+deb11u1","1.0.0~rc93+ds1-5+deb11u2","1.0.0~rc93+ds1-5+deb11u3","1.0.0~rc93+ds1-5+deb11u4","1.0.0~rc93+ds1-5+deb11u5","1.0.0~rc93.144.g6538f9f2+ds1-1","1.0.0~rc94+ds1-1","1.0.0~rc94+ds1-2","1.0.0~rc95.86.g2f8e8e9d+ds1-1","1.0.1+ds1-1","1.0.1+ds1-2","1.0.2+ds1-1","1.0.2+ds1-2","1.0.3+ds1-1","1.1.0+ds1-1","1.1.0~rc.1+ds1-1","1.1.1+ds1-1","1.1.10+ds1-1","1.1.12+ds1-1","1.1.12+ds1-2","1.1.12+ds1-3","1.1.12+ds1-4","1.1.12+ds1-5","1.1.12+ds1-5.1","1.1.15+ds1-1","1.1.15+ds1-2","1.1.3+ds1-1","1.1.3+ds1-2","1.1.3+ds1-3","1.1.3+ds1-4","1.1.3+ds1-5","1.1.3+ds1-6","1.1.3+ds1-7","1.1.4+ds1-1","1.1.5+ds1-1","1.1.5+ds1-2","1.1.5+ds1-3","1.1.5+ds1-4","1.1.5+ds1-5","1.3.0+ds1-1","1.3.0+ds1-2","1.3.0+ds1-3","1.3.0+ds1-4","1.3.2+ds1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-31133.json"}},{"package":{"name":"runc","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/runc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.1.10+ds1-1","1.1.12+ds1-1","1.1.12+ds1-2","1.1.12+ds1-3","1.1.12+ds1-4","1.1.12+ds1-5","1.1.12+ds1-5.1","1.1.15+ds1-1","1.1.15+ds1-2","1.1.5+ds1-1","1.1.5+ds1-1+deb12u1","1.1.5+ds1-2","1.1.5+ds1-3","1.1.5+ds1-4","1.1.5+ds1-5","1.3.0+ds1-1","1.3.0+ds1-2","1.3.0+ds1-3","1.3.0+ds1-4","1.3.2+ds1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-31133.json"}},{"package":{"name":"runc","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/runc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.1.15+ds1-2","1.3.0+ds1-1","1.3.0+ds1-2","1.3.0+ds1-3","1.3.0+ds1-4","1.3.2+ds1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-31133.json"}},{"package":{"name":"runc","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/runc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.1.15+ds1-2","1.3.0+ds1-1","1.3.0+ds1-2","1.3.0+ds1-3","1.3.0+ds1-4","1.3.2+ds1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-31133.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-31133"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
