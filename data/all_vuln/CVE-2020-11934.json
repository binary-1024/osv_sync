{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2020-11934","published":"2020-07-29T17:15:12Z","modified":"2025-08-09T19:01:28Z","details":"It was discovered that snapctl user-open allowed altering the $XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable when calling the system xdg-open. OpenURL() in usersession/userd/launcher.go would alter $XDG_DATA_DIRS to append a path to a directory controlled by the calling snap. A malicious snap could exploit this to bypass intended access restrictions to control how the host system xdg-open script opens the URL and, for example, execute a script shipped with the snap without confinement. This issue did not affect Ubuntu Core systems. Fixed in snapd versions 2.45.1ubuntu0.2, 2.45.1+18.04.2 and 2.45.1+20.04.2.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://launchpad.net/bugs/1880085"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://ubuntu.com/USN-4424-1"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
