An attacker could potentially use this vector to compromise the security of the target repository, even passing unnotice because the action will run normally.\n\n### Impact\nCritical, CWE-94","affected":[{"package":{"name":"j178/prek-action","ecosystem":"GitHub Actions"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 1.0.5","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-pwf7-47c3-mfhx/GHSA-pwf7-47c3-mfhx.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/j178/prek-action/security/advisories/GHSA-pwf7-47c3-mfhx"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/j178/prek-action/commit/6b7c6ef5c3875c766893b881b40773cd5605bde3"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/j178/prek-action"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-94"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-09-29T17:51:19Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"CRITICAL"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
