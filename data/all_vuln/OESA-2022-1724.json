  "details": "The logrotate utility is designed to simplify the administration of log files on a system which generates a lot of log files.  Logrotate allows for the automatic rotation compression, removal and mailing of log files.logrotate  Logrotate can be set to handle a log file daily, weekly, monthly or when the log file gets to a certain size.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA vulnerability was found in logrotate in how the state file is created. The state file is used to prevent parallel executions of multiple instances of logrotate by acquiring and releasing a file lock. When the state file does not exist, it is created with world-readable permission, allowing an unprivileged user to lock the state file, stopping any rotation. This flaw affects logrotate versions before 3.20.0.(CVE-2022-1348)",
