When XSLT functions, such as the key() process, result in tree fragments, this corruption prevents the proper cleanup of ID attributes. As a result, the system may access freed memory, causing crashes or enabling attackers to trigger heap corruption.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libxslt","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libxslt?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.1.34-4","1.1.34-4+deb11u1","1.1.34-4+deb11u2","1.1.34-4+deb11u3","1.1.35-1","1.1.35-1.1","1.1.35-1.2","1.1.35-2","1.1.39-0exp1","1.1.43-0.1","1.1.43-0.2","1.1.43-0exp1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-7425.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libxslt","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libxslt?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.1.35-1","1.1.35-1+deb12u1","1.1.35-1+deb12u2","1.1.35-1+deb12u3","1.1.35-1.1","1.1.35-1.2","1.1.35-2","1.1.39-0exp1","1.1.43-0.1","1.1.43-0.2","1.1.43-0exp1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-7425.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libxslt","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libxslt?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.1.35-1.2","1.1.35-1.2+deb13u1","1.1.35-1.2+deb13u2","1.1.35-2","1.1.39-0exp1","1.1.43-0.1","1.1.43-0.2","1.1.43-0exp1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-7425.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libxslt","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libxslt?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.1.35-1.2","1.1.35-2","1.1.39-0exp1","1.1.43-0.1","1.1.43-0.2","1.1.43-0exp1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-7425.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-7425"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H"}]}
