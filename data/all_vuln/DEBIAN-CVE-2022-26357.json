VT-d hardware may allow for only less than 15 bits to hold a domain ID associating a physical device with a particular domain. Therefore internally Xen domain IDs are mapped to the smaller value range. The cleaning up of the housekeeping structures has a race, allowing for VT-d domain IDs to be leaked and flushes to be bypassed.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"xen","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xen?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.14.4+74-gd7b22226b5-1"}]}],"versions":["4.14.2+25-gb6a8c4f72d-2","4.14.3+32-g9de3671772-1","4.14.3+32-g9de3671772-1~deb11u1","4.14.3-1","4.14.3-1~deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-26357.json"}},{"package":{"name":"xen","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xen?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.16.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-26357.json"}},{"package":{"name":"xen","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xen?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.16.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-26357.json"}},{"package":{"name":"xen","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xen?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.16.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-26357.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-26357"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
