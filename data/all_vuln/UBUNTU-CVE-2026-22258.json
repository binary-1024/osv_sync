{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"UBUNTU-CVE-2026-22258","published":"2026-01-27T17:16:00Z","modified":"2026-01-30T21:15:08.037579Z","upstream":["CVE-2026-22258"],"details":"Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine. Prior to versions 8.0.3 and 7.0.14, crafted DCERPC traffic can cause Suricata to expand a buffer w/o limits, leading to memory exhaustion and the process getting killed. While reported for DCERPC over UDP, it is believed that DCERPC over TCP and SMB are also vulnerable. DCERPC/TCP in the default configuration should not be vulnerable as the default stream depth is limited to 1MiB. Versions 8.0.3 and 7.0.14 contain a patch. Some workarounds are available. For DCERPC/UDP, disable the parser. For DCERPC/TCP, the `stream.reassembly.depth` setting will limit the amount of data that can be buffered. For DCERPC/SMB, the `stream.reassembly.depth` can be used as well, but is set to unlimited by default. Imposing a limit here may lead to loss of visibility in SMB.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"suricata","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/suricata@3.0-1?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.8-1build1","2.0.9-1","2.0.10-1","2.0.10-2","2.0.11-1","3.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"suricata","binary_version":"3.0-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2026/UBUNTU-CVE-2026-22258.json"}},{"package":{"name":"suricata","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/suricata@3.2-2ubuntu3?arch=source&distro=bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.2-2ubuntu3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"libhtp-0.5.23-1","binary_version":"3.2-2ubuntu3"},{"binary_name":"suricata","binary_version":"3.2-2ubuntu3"},{"binary_name":"suricata-hyperscan","binary_version":"3.2-2ubuntu3"},{"binary_name":"suricata-oinkmaster","binary_version":"3.2-2ubuntu3"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2026/UBUNTU-CVE-2026-22258.json"}},{"package":{"name":"suricata","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:22.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/suricata@1:6.0.4-3?arch=source&distro=jammy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:6.0.4-2","1:6.0.4-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"suricata","binary_version":"1:6.0.4-3"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2026/UBUNTU-CVE-2026-22258.json"}},{"package":{"name":"suricata","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/suricata@1:7.0.3-1build3?arch=source&distro=noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:7.0.0-2","1:7.0.2-1","1:7.0.2-1build1","1:7.0.3-1build1","1:7.0.3-1build3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"suricata","binary_version":"1:7.0.3-1build3"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2026/UBUNTU-CVE-2026-22258.json"}},{"package":{"name":"suricata","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.10","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/suricata@1:7.0.10-1?arch=source&distro=questing"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:7.0.8-2","1:7.0.10-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"suricata","binary_version":"1:7.0.10-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2026/UBUNTU-CVE-2026-22258.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2026-22258"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22258"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-289c-h599-3xcx"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/39d8c302af3422a096b75474a4f295a754ec6a74"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/f82a388d0283725cb76782cf64e8341cab370830"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/8182"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
