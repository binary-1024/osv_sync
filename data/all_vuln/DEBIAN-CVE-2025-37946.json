  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/pci: Fix duplicate pci_dev_put() in disable_slot() when PF has child VFs  With commit bcb5d6c76903 (\"s390/pci: introduce lock to synchronize state of zpci_dev's\") the code to ignore power off of a PF that has child VFs was changed from a direct return to a goto to the unlock and pci_dev_put() section. The change however left the existing pci_dev_put() untouched resulting in a doubple put. This can subsequently cause a use after free if the struct pci_dev is released in an unexpected state. Fix this by removing the extra pci_dev_put().",
