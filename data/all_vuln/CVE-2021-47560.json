Problem was only observed when running on top of a buggy emulator.","references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/63b08b1f6834bbb0b4f7783bf63b80c8c8e9a047"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/90d0736876c50ecde1a3275636a06b9ddb1cace9"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/da4d70199e5d82da664a80077508d6c18f5e76df"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
