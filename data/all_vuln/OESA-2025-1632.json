It uses GObjects and the glib main loop, to integrate well with GNOME applications, and also has a synchronous API, for use in threaded applications.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA denial-of-service vulnerability has been identified in the libsoup HTTP client library. This flaw can be triggered when a libsoup client receives a 401 (Unauthorized) HTTP response containing a specifically crafted domain parameter within the WWW-Authenticate header. Processing this malformed header can lead to a crash of the client application using libsoup. An attacker could exploit this by setting up a malicious HTTP server. If a user&apos;s application using the vulnerable libsoup library connects to this malicious server, it could result in a denial-of-service. Successful exploitation requires tricking a user&apos;s client application into connecting to the attacker&apos;s malicious server.(CVE-2025-4476)\n\nA flaw was found in the soup_multipart_new_from_message() function of the libsoup HTTP library, which is commonly used by GNOME and other applications to handle web communications. The issue occurs when the library processes specially crafted multipart messages. Due to improper validation, an internal calculation can go wrong, leading to an integer underflow. This can cause the program to access invalid memory and crash. As a result, any application or server using libsoup could be forced to exit unexpectedly, creating a denial-of-service (DoS) risk.(CVE-2025-4948)\n\nA vulnerability was found in the libsoup package. This flaw stems from its failure to correctly verify the termination of multipart HTTP messages. This can allow a remote attacker to send a specially crafted multipart HTTP body, causing the libsoup-consuming server to read beyond its allocated memory boundaries (out-of-bounds read).(CVE-2025-4969)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libsoup","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/libsoup&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.74.3-10.oe2403sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libsoup-2.74.3-10.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","libsoup-debuginfo-2.74.3-10.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","libsoup-debugsource-2.74.3-10.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","libsoup-devel-2.74.3-10.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","libsoup-2.74.3-10.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","libsoup-debuginfo-2.74.3-10.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","libsoup-debugsource-2.74.3-10.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","libsoup-devel-2.74.3-10.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["libsoup-help-2.74.3-10.oe2403.noarch.rpm","libsoup-help-2.74.3-10.oe2403sp1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["libsoup-2.74.3-10.oe2403.src.rpm","libsoup-2.74.3-10.oe2403sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libsoup-2.74.3-10.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","libsoup-debuginfo-2.74.3-10.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","libsoup-debugsource-2.74.3-10.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","libsoup-devel-2.74.3-10.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","libsoup-2.74.3-10.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","libsoup-debuginfo-2.74.3-10.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","libsoup-debugsource-2.74.3-10.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","libsoup-devel-2.74.3-10.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1632.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libsoup","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/libsoup&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.74.3-10.oe2403sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libsoup-2.74.3-10.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","libsoup-debuginfo-2.74.3-10.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","libsoup-debugsource-2.74.3-10.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","libsoup-devel-2.74.3-10.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["libsoup-help-2.74.3-10.oe2403sp1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["libsoup-2.74.3-10.oe2403sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libsoup-2.74.3-10.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","libsoup-debuginfo-2.74.3-10.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","libsoup-debugsource-2.74.3-10.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","libsoup-devel-2.74.3-10.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1632.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libsoup","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/libsoup&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.71.0-9.oe2003sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libsoup-2.71.0-9.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libsoup-debuginfo-2.71.0-9.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libsoup-debugsource-2.71.0-9.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libsoup-devel-2.71.0-9.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["libsoup-help-2.71.0-9.oe2003sp4.noarch.rpm"],"src":["libsoup-2.71.0-9.oe2003sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libsoup-2.71.0-9.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libsoup-debuginfo-2.71.0-9.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libsoup-debugsource-2.71.0-9.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libsoup-devel-2.71.0-9.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1632.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libsoup","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/libsoup&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.74.2-10.oe2203sp3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libsoup-2.74.2-10.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","libsoup-debuginfo-2.74.2-10.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","libsoup-debugsource-2.74.2-10.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","libsoup-devel-2.74.2-10.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["libsoup-help-2.74.2-10.oe2203sp3.noarch.rpm"],"src":["libsoup-2.74.2-10.oe2203sp3.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libsoup-2.74.2-10.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","libsoup-debuginfo-2.74.2-10.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","libsoup-debugsource-2.74.2-10.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","libsoup-devel-2.74.2-10.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1632.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libsoup","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/libsoup&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.74.2-10.oe2203sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libsoup-2.74.2-10.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","libsoup-debuginfo-2.74.2-10.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","libsoup-debugsource-2.74.2-10.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","libsoup-devel-2.74.2-10.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["libsoup-help-2.74.2-10.oe2203sp4.noarch.rpm"],"src":["libsoup-2.74.2-10.oe2203sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libsoup-2.74.2-10.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","libsoup-debuginfo-2.74.2-10.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","libsoup-debugsource-2.74.2-10.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","libsoup-devel-2.74.2-10.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1632.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-1632"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4476"},{"type":"ADVI
