This issue, referred to as the \"MadeYouReset\" attack, allows malicious clients to induce excessive server workload by repeatedly causing server-side stream aborts. While not a protocol bug, this highlights a common implementation weakness that can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"undertow","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/undertow?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.3.20-1"}]}],"versions":["1.3.11-1","1.3.16-1","1.3.19-1","1.3.21-1","1.3.23-1","1.3.4-1","1.3.5-1","1.3.7-1","1.4.0-1","1.4.1-1","1.4.18-1","1.4.20-1","1.4.21-1","1.4.21-2","1.4.22-1","1.4.23-1","1.4.23-2","1.4.23-3","1.4.25-1","1.4.25-2","1.4.3-1","1.4.4-1","1.4.6-1","1.4.7-1","1.4.8-1","2.0.23-1","2.0.25-1","2.0.26-1","2.0.27-1","2.0.28-1","2.0.29-1","2.0.30-1","2.1.0-1","2.1.1-1","2.1.3-1","2.2.0-1","2.2.10-1","2.2.12-1","2.2.13-1","2.2.14-1","2.2.16-1","2.2.17-1","2.2.18-1","2.2.19-1","2.2.2-1","2.2.20-1","2.2.21-1","2.2.3-1","2.2.4-1","2.2.5-1","2.2.8-1","2.3.18-1","2.3.18-2","2.3.8-1","2.3.8-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-9784.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-9784"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
