A possible mitigation has been published immediately after the disclosure of the vulnerability.(CVE-2025-46334)\n\nA vulnerability was found in j6t git-gui up to 2.50.0 (Versioning Software). It has been rated as critical.Using CWE to declare the problem leads to CWE-88. The product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.Impacted is confidentiality, integrity, and availability.The vulnerability scanner Nessus provides a plugin with the ID 241644 (FreeBSD : git -- multiple vulnerabilities (2a4472ed-5c0d-11f0-b991-291fce777db8)), which helps to determine the existence of the flaw in a target environment.Upgrading to version 2.43.7, 2.44.4, 2.45.4, 2.46.4, 2.47.3, 2.48.2, 2.49.1 or 2.50.1 eliminates this vulnerability.The vulnerability is also documented in the vulnerability database at Tenable (241644).(CVE-2025-46835)\n\nGit is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When reading a config value, Git strips any trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when the config is later read. When initializing a submodule, if the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location. If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the submodule hooks directory, and the submodule contains an executable post-checkout hook, the script may be unintentionally executed after checkout. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.(CVE-2025-48384)\n\nGit is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. The wincred credential helper uses a static buffer (target) as a unique key for storing and comparing against internal storage. This credential helper does not properly bounds check the available space remaining in the buffer before appending to it with wcsncat(), leading to potential buffer overflows.
