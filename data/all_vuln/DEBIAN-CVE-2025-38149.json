  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: phy: clear phydev->devlink when the link is deleted  There is a potential crash issue when disabling and re-enabling the network port. When disabling the network port, phy_detach() calls device_link_del() to remove the device link, but it does not clear phydev->devlink, so phydev->devlink is not a NULL pointer. Then the network port is re-enabled, but if phy_attach_direct() fails before calling device_link_add(), the code jumps to the \"error\" label and calls phy_detach(). Since phydev->devlink retains the old value from the previous attach/detach cycle, device_link_del() uses the old value, which accesses a NULL pointer and causes a crash. The simplified crash log is as follows.  [   24.702421] Call trace: [   24.704856]  device_link_put_kref+0x20/0x120 [   24.709124]  device_link_del+0x30/0x48 [   24.712864]  phy_detach+0x24/0x168 [   24.716261]  phy_attach_direct+0x168/0x3a4 [   24.720352]  phylink_fwnode_phy_connect+0xc8/0x14c [   24.725140]  phylink_of_phy_connect+0x1c/0x34  Therefore, phydev->devlink needs to be cleared when the device link is deleted.",
