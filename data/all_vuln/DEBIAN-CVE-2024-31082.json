{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31082","published":"2024-04-04T14:15:10Z","modified":"2025-10-14T04:25:46.690150Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-31082"],"details":"A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability was found in the X.org server's ProcAppleDRICreatePixmap() function. This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"xorg-server","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xorg-server?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2:1.20.11-1+deb11u13"}]}],"versions":["2:1.20.11-1","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u1","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u10","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u11","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u12","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u2","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u3","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u4","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u5","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u6","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u7","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u8","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31082.json"}},{"package":{"name":"xorg-server","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xorg-server?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2:21.1.7-3+deb12u7"}]}],"versions":["2:21.1.7-3","2:21.1.7-3+deb12u1","2:21.1.7-3+deb12u2","2:21.1.7-3+deb12u3","2:21.1.7-3+deb12u4","2:21.1.7-3+deb12u5","2:21.1.7-3+deb12u6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31082.json"}},{"package":{"name":"xorg-server","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xorg-server?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2:21.1.11-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31082.json"}},{"package":{"name":"xorg-server","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xorg-server?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2:21.1.11-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31082.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-31082"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H"}]}
