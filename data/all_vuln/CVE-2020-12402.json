This allowed an attacker able to perform electromagnetic-based side channel attacks to record traces leading to the recovery of the secret primes. *Note:* An unmodified Firefox browser does not generate RSA keys in normal operation and is not affected, but products built on top of it might. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 78.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00016.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00018.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00027.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00049.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1631597"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/09/msg00029.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202007-10"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4417-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4417-2/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4726"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2020-24/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RFL6UNFK4MG2WDXLMLFAEIUSM5EUK7CG/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UWVDJRARXNWWWTCGMM63EXLQHH2LNOXO/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
