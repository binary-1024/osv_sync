{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68246","published":"2025-12-16T15:15:53.880Z","modified":"2026-01-10T14:08:00.639756Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-68246"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ksmbd: close accepted socket when per-IP limit rejects connection  When the per-IP connection limit is exceeded in ksmbd_kthread_fn(), the code sets ret = -EAGAIN and continues the accept loop without closing the just-accepted socket. That leaks one socket per rejected attempt from a single IP and enables a trivial remote DoS.  Release client_sk before continuing.
