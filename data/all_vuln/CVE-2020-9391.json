It ignores the top byte in the address passed to the brk system call, potentially moving the memory break downwards when the application expects it to move upwards, aka CID-dcde237319e6. This has been observed to cause heap corruption with the GNU C Library malloc implementation.","references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/02/25/6"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1797052"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=dcde237319e626d1ec3c9d8b7613032f0fd4663a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200313-0003/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/O4LH35HOPBJIKYHYFXMBBM75DN75PZHZ/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
