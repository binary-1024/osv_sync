The attacker could then connect to a PowerShell session and send commands to execute arbitrary code.</p>\n<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how PowerShell commands are validated when WDAC protection is enabled.</p>","affected":[{"package":{"name":"powershell","ecosystem":"Bitnami","purl":"pkg:bitnami/powershell"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"7.0.0"},{"fixed":"7.0.8"},{"introduced":"7.1.0"},{"fixed":"7.1.5"}]},{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"7.0.8"},{"last_affected":"7.0.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/bitnami/vulndb/tree/main/data/powershell/BIT-powershell-2020-0951.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-0951"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0951"}],"database_specific":{"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:powershell:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"severity":"Medium"}}
