  "details": "## Summary\n\n`jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy` was meant to rely on UNIX sockets readable only by the current user since version 3.0.0, but when used with TigerVNC, the VNC server started by `jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy` were still accessible via the network.\n\nThis vulnerability does not affect users having TurboVNC as the `vncserver` executable.\n\n## Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was identified by Arne Gottwald at University of G\u00f6ttingen and analyzed, reported, and reviewed by @frejanordsiek.",
