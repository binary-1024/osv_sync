In versions prior to 5.6.0, upon authentication, the user could be associated by e-mail even if the `associate_by_email` pipeline was not included. This could lead to account compromise when a third-party authentication service does not validate provided e-mail addresses or doesn't require unique e-mail addresses. Version 5.6.0 contains a patch. As a workaround, review the authentication service policy on e-mail addresses; many will not allow exploiting this vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"social-auth-app-django","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/social-auth-app-django?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.1.0-2.1","5.0.0-1","5.2.0-1","5.2.0-2","5.4.0-1","5.4.1-1","5.4.2-1","5.4.3-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-61783.json"}},{"package":{"name":"social-auth-app-django","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/social-auth-app-django?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.0.0-1","5.2.0-1","5.2.0-2","5.4.0-1","5.4.1-1","5.4.2-1","5.4.3-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-61783.json"}},{"package":{"name":"social-auth-app-django","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/social-auth-app-django?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.4.3-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-61783.json"}},{"package":{"name":"social-auth-app-django","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/social-auth-app-django?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.4.3-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-61783.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-61783"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
