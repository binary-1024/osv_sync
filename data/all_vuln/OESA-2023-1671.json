  "details": "Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser, designed for standards compliance, performance and portability.\r\n\r\nMozilla Firefox is a standalone web browser, designed for standards compliance and performance.  Its functionality can be enhanced via a plethora of extensions.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn attacker could have triggered a use-after-free condition when creating a WebRTC connection over HTTPS. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 115, Firefox ESR &lt; 102.13, and Thunderbird &lt; 102.13.(CVE-2023-37201)\r\n\r\nCross-compartment wrappers wrapping a scripted proxy could have caused objects from other compartments to be stored in the main compartment resulting in a use-after-free. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 115, Firefox ESR &lt; 102.13, and Thunderbird &lt; 102.13.(CVE-2023-37202)\r\n\r\nA website could have obscured the fullscreen notification by using a URL with a scheme handled by an external program, such as a mailto URL. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 115, Firefox ESR &lt; 102.13, and Thunderbird &lt; 102.13.(CVE-2023-37207)\r\n\r\nWhen opening Diagcab files, Firefox did not warn the user that these files may contain malicious code. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 115, Firefox ESR &lt; 102.13, and Thunderbird &lt; 102.13.(CVE-2023-37208)\r\n\r\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 114, Firefox ESR 102.12, and Thunderbird 102.12. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 115, Firefox ESR &lt; 102.13, and Thunderbird &lt; 102.13.(CVE-2023-37211)\r\n\r\nOffscreen Canvas did not properly track cross-origin tainting, which could have been used to access image data from another site in violation of same-origin policy. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 116, Firefox ESR &lt; 102.14, and Firefox ESR &lt; 115.1.(CVE-2023-4045)\r\n\r\nIn some circumstances, a stale value could have been used for a global variable in WASM JIT analysis. This resulted in incorrect compilation and a potentially exploitable crash in the content process. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 116, Firefox ESR &lt; 102.14, and Firefox ESR &lt; 115.1.(CVE-2023-4046)\r\n\r\nA bug in popup notifications delay calculation could have made it possible for an attacker to trick a user into granting permissions. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 116, Firefox ESR &lt; 102.14, and Firefox ESR &lt; 115.1.(CVE-2023-4047)\r\n\r\nAn out-of-bounds read could have led to an exploitable crash when parsing HTML with DOMParser in low memory situations. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 116, Firefox ESR &lt; 102.14, and Firefox ESR &lt; 115.1.(CVE-2023-4048)\r\n\r\nRace conditions in reference counting code were found through code inspection. These could have resulted in potentially exploitable use-after-free vulnerabilities. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 116, Firefox ESR &lt; 102.14, and Firefox ESR &lt; 115.1.(CVE-2023-4049)\r\n\r\nIn some cases, an untrusted input stream was copied to a stack buffer without checking its size. This resulted in a potentially exploitable crash which could have led to a sandbox escape. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 116, Firefox ESR &lt; 102.14, and Firefox ESR &lt; 115.1.(CVE-2023-4050)\r\n\r\nWhen opening appref-ms files, Firefox did not warn the user that these files may contain malicious code. \n*This bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 116, Firefox ESR &lt; 102.14, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.1, Thunderbird &lt; 102.14, and Thunderbird &lt; 115.1.(CVE-2023-4054)\r\n\r\nWhen the number of cookies per domain was exceeded in `document.cookie`, the actual cookie jar sent to the host was no longer consistent with expected cookie jar state. This could have caused requests to be sent with some cookies missing. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 116, Firefox ESR &lt; 102.14, and Firefox ESR &lt; 115.1.(CVE-2023-4055)\r\n\r\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 115, Firefox ESR 115.0, Firefox ESR 102.13, Thunderbird 115.0, and Thunderbird 102.13. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 116, Firefox ESR &lt; 102.14, and Firefox ESR &lt; 115.1.(CVE-2023-4056)",
