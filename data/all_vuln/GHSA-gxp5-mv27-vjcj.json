After asymmetric decryption and before symmetric decryption, a SHA-256 checksum is performed on the metadata and encrypted data. All encrypted data is discarded if the checksum does not match without attempting to decrypt since the encrypted data is assumed invalid.  The data stored is GitHub App authentication tokens which will expire within one hour.\n\n### Patches\n\nJervis patch will migrate from `AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding` to `AES/GCM/NoPadding`.\n\nUpgrade to Jervis 2.2.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone\n\n### References\n\n- [Padding Oracle Attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"net.gleske:jervis","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/net.gleske/jervis"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.2"}]}],"versions":["0.1","0.10","0.11","0.12","0.13","0.2","0.3","0.4","0.5","0.5.1","0.5.2","0.6","0.7","0.8","0.9","1.0","1.1","1.2","1.3","1.4","1.5","1.6","1.7","2.0","2.0.1","2.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-gxp5-mv27-vjcj/GHSA-gxp5-mv27-vjcj.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/samrocketman/jervis/security/advisories/GHSA-gxp5-mv27-vjcj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68931"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/samrocketman/jervis/commit/c3981ff71de7b0f767dfe7b37a2372cb2a51974a"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/samrocketman/jervis"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/samrocketman/jervis/blob/157d2b63ffa5c4bb1d8ee2254950fd2231de2b05/src/main/groovy/net/gleske/jervis/tools/SecurityIO.groovy#L682-L684"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/samrocketman/jervis/blob/157d2b63ffa5c4bb1d8ee2254950fd2231de2b05/src/main/groovy/net/gleske/jervis/tools/SecurityIO.groovy#L720-L722"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://github.com/samrocketman/jervis/commit/c3981ff71de7b0f767dfe7b37a2372cb2a51974a"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-287","CWE-327"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-13T14:56:49Z","nvd_published_at":"2026-01-13T20:16:07Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
