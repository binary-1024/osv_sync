  "details": "It was discovered that the DCG implementation in the RMI component of\nOpenJDK failed to correctly handle references. A remote attacker could\npossibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of\nRMI registry or a Java RMI application (CVE-2017-10102).\n\nMultiple flaws were discovered in the RMI, JAXP, ImageIO, Libraries,\nAWT, Hotspot, and Security components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java\napplication or applet could use these flaws to completely bypass Java\nsandbox restrictions (CVE-2017-10107, CVE-2017-10096, CVE-2017-10101,\nCVE-2017-10089, CVE-2017-10090, CVE-2017-10087, CVE-2017-10111,\nCVE-2017-10110, CVE-2017-10074, CVE-2017-10067).\n\nIt was discovered that the LDAPCertStore class in the Security component\nof OpenJDK followed LDAP referrals to arbitrary URLs. A specially\ncrafted LDAP referral URL could cause LDAPCertStore to communicate with\nnon-LDAP servers (CVE-2017-10116).\n\nIt was discovered that the Nashorn JavaScript engine in the Scripting\ncomponent of OpenJDK could allow scripts to access Java APIs even when\naccess to Java APIs was disabled. An untrusted JavaScript executed by\nNashorn could use this flaw to bypass intended restrictions\n(CVE-2017-10078).\n\nIt was discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK could fail to\nproperly enforce restrictions defined for processing of X.509\ncertificate chains. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to\nmake Java accept certificate using one of the disabled algorithms\n(CVE-2017-10198).\n\nA covert timing channel flaw was found in the DSA implementation in the\nJCE component of OpenJDK. A remote attacker able to make a Java\napplication generate DSA signatures on demand could possibly use this\nflaw to extract certain information about the used key via a timing side\nchannel (CVE-2017-10115).\n\nA covert timing channel flaw was found in the PKCS#8 implementation in\nthe JCE component of OpenJDK. A remote attacker able to make a Java\napplication repeatedly compare PKCS#8 key against an attacker controlled\nvalue could possibly use this flaw to determine the key via a timing\nside channel (CVE-2017-10135).\n\nIt was discovered that the BasicAttribute and CodeSource classes in\nOpenJDK did not limit the amount of memory allocated when creating\nobject instances from a serialized form. A specially crafted serialized\ninput stream could cause Java to consume an excessive amount of memory\n(CVE-2017-10108, CVE-2017-10109).\n\nMultiple flaws were found in the Hotspot and Security components in\nOpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws\nto bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions (CVE-2017-10081,\nCVE-2017-10193).\n\nIt was discovered that the JPEGImageReader implementation in the 2D\ncomponent of OpenJDK would, in certain cases, read all image data even\nif it was not used later. A specially crafted image could cause a Java\napplication to temporarily use an excessive amount of CPU and memory\n(CVE-2017-10053).\n",
