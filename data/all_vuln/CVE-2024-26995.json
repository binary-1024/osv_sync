  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: typec: tcpm: Correct the PDO counting in pd_set\n\nOff-by-one errors happen because nr_snk_pdo and nr_src_pdo are\nincorrectly added one. The index of the loop is equal to the number of\nPDOs to be updated when leaving the loop and it doesn't need to be added\none.\n\nWhen doing the power negotiation, TCPM relies on the \"nr_snk_pdo\" as\nthe size of the local sink PDO array to match the Source capabilities\nof the partner port. If the off-by-one overflow occurs, a wrong RDO\nmight be sent and unexpected power transfer might happen such as over\nvoltage or over current (than expected).\n\n\"nr_src_pdo\" is used to set the Rp level when the port is in Source\nrole. It is also the array size of the local Source capabilities when\nfilling up the buffer which will be sent as the Source PDOs (such as\nin Power Negotiation). If the off-by-one overflow occurs, a wrong Rp\nlevel might be set and wrong Source PDOs will be sent to the partner\nport. This could potentially cause over current or port resets.",
