It is suitable for both desktop/laptop computers and embedded systems. Supplicant is the IEEE 802.1X/WPA component that is used in the client stations. It implements key negotiation with a WPA Authenticator and it controls the roaming and IEEE 802.11 authentication/association of the wlan driver.\\r\\n\\r\\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\\r\\n\\r\\n\r\nThe implementations of SAE and EAP-pwd in hostapd and wpa_supplicant 2.x through 2.8 are vulnerable to side-channel attacks as a result of observable timing differences and cache access patterns when Brainpool curves are used. An attacker may be able to gain leaked information from a side-channel attack that can be used for full password recovery.(CVE-2019-13377)\\r\\n\\r\\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wpa_supplicant","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/wpa_supplicant&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.6-27.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["wpa_supplicant-2.6-27.oe1.aarch64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-debuginfo-2.6-27.oe1.aarch64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-debugsource-2.6-27.oe1.aarch64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-gui-2.6-27.oe1.aarch64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-help-2.6-27.oe1.aarch64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-2.6-27.oe1.aarch64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-debuginfo-2.6-27.oe1.aarch64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-debugsource-2.6-27.oe1.aarch64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-gui-2.6-27.oe1.aarch64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-help-2.6-27.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["wpa_supplicant-2.6-27.oe1.src.rpm","wpa_supplicant-2.6-27.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["wpa_supplicant-2.6-27.oe1.x86_64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-debuginfo-2.6-27.oe1.x86_64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-debugsource-2.6-27.oe1.x86_64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-gui-2.6-27.oe1.x86_64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-help-2.6-27.oe1.x86_64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-2.6-27.oe1.x86_64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-debuginfo-2.6-27.oe1.x86_64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-debugsource-2.6-27.oe1.x86_64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-gui-2.6-27.oe1.x86_64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-help-2.6-27.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1019.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wpa_supplicant","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/wpa_supplicant&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.6-27.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["wpa_supplicant-2.6-27.oe1.aarch64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-debuginfo-2.6-27.oe1.aarch64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-debugsource-2.6-27.oe1.aarch64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-gui-2.6-27.oe1.aarch64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-help-2.6-27.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["wpa_supplicant-2.6-27.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["wpa_supplicant-2.6-27.oe1.x86_64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-debuginfo-2.6-27.oe1.x86_64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-debugsource-2.6-27.oe1.x86_64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-gui-2.6-27.oe1.x86_64.rpm","wpa_supplicant-help-2.6-27.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1019.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1019"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13377"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
