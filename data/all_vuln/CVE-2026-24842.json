This mismatch allows an attacker to craft a malicious TAR archive that bypasses path traversal protections and creates hardlinks to arbitrary files outside the extraction directory. Version 7.5.7 contains a fix for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4a37eb9a1cf1137df4eb70c5c7f849f412ff3cdb"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.1.10","0.1.11","0.1.12","0.1.13","0.1.2","0.1.3","0.1.5","0.1.6","0.1.7","0.1.8","0.1.9","v0.1.14","v0.1.15","v0.1.16","v0.1.17","v0.1.18","v0.1.19","v0.1.20","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.2.1","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.1.10","v3.1.11","v3.1.12","v3.1.13","v3.1.14","v3.1.15","v3.1.2","v3.1.3","v3.1.4","v3.1.5","v3.1.6","v3.1.7","v3.1.8","v3.1.9","v3.2.0","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.1.2","v4.2.0","v4.3.0","v4.3.1","v4.3.2","v4.3.3","v4.4.0","v4.4.1","v4.4.10","v4.4.11","v4.4.12","v4.4.13","v4.4.2","v4.4.3","v4.4.4","v4.4.5","v4.4.6","v4.4.7","v4.4.8","v4.4.9","v5.0.0","v5.0.1","v5.0.2","v5.0.3","v5.0.4","v5.0.5","v6.0.0","v6.0.1","v6.0.2","v6.0.3","v6.0.4","v6.0.5","v6.1.0","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.2","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2.0","v6.2.1","v7.0.0","v7.0.1","v7.1.0","v7.2.0","v7.3.0","v7.4.0","v7.4.1","v7.4.2","v7.4.3","v7.4.4","v7.5.0","v7.5.1","v7.5.2","v7.5.3","v7.5.4","v7.5.5","v7.5.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24842.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24842.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/commit/f4a7aa9bc3d717c987fdf1480ff7a64e87ffdb46"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-34x7-hfp2-rc4v"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24842"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-22","CWE-59"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24842.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N"}]}
