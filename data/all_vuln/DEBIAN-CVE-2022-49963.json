Looking closer it looks like we have the following issues in migrate_copy():    - We are using plain integer in various places, which we can easily     overflow with a large object.    - We pass the entire object size (when the src is lmem) into     emit_pte() and then try to copy it, which doesn't work, since we     only have a few fixed sized windows in which to map the pages and     perform the copy. With an object > 8M we therefore aren't properly     copying the pages. And then with an object > 64M we trigger the     GEM_BUG_ON(num_ccs_blks > NUM_CCS_BLKS_PER_XFER).  So it looks like our copy handling for any object > 8M (which is our CHUNK_SZ) is currently broken on DG2.
