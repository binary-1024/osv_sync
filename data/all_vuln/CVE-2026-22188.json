The deploy-stub executable allocates argv_copy and argv_copy2 using alloca() based directly on the attacker-controlled argc value without validation. Supplying a large number of command-line arguments can exhaust stack space and propagate uninitialized stack memory into Python interpreter initialization, resulting in a reliable crash and undefined behavior.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"e560eb8da370d86b096d6cb65eafd9ab40879b9a"}]}],"versions":["v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.10","v1.10.11","v1.10.12","v1.10.13","v1.10.14","v1.10.15","v1.10.16","v1.10.2","v1.10.3","v1.10.4","v1.10.4.1","v1.10.5","v1.10.6","v1.10.7","v1.10.8","v1.10.9","v1.8.0","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v1.9.3","v1.9.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22188.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.panda3d.org/"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2026/Jan/9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/panda3d-deploy-stub-stack-exhaustion-via-unbounded-alloca"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
