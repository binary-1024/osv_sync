For example, an attacker can exploit a race condition to insert a symlink from /var/log/groonga/httpd to /etc/bash_completion.d. NOTE: this is an issue in the Debian packaging of the Groonga HTTP server.","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bugs.debian.org/928304"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
