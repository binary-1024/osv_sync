Using the nashorn script engine the environment of the javascript execution for the Proxy Auto-Configuration leaks privileged objects, that can be used to circumvent the execution limits. If a different script engine was used, no execution limits were in place. Both vectors allow remote code execution.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"netbeans","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/netbeans?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"10.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-17191.json"}},{"package":{"name":"netbeans","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/netbeans?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"10.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-17191.json"}},{"package":{"name":"netbeans","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/netbeans?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"10.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-17191.json"}},{"package":{"name":"netbeans","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/netbeans?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"10.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-17191.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-17191"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
