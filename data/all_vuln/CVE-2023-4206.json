{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-4206","published":"2023-09-06T14:15:11Z","modified":"2025-08-09T19:01:27Z","related":["ALSA-2023:7077"],"details":"A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_route component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\n\nWhen route4_change() is called on an existing filter, the whole tcf_result struct is always copied into the new instance of the filter. This causes a problem when updating a filter bound to a class, as tcf_unbind_filter() is always called on the old instance in the success path, decreasing filter_cnt of the still referenced class and allowing it to be deleted, leading to a use-after-free.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit b80b829e9e2c1b3f7aae34855e04d8f6ecaf13c8.","references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=b80b829e9e2c1b3f7aae34855e04d8f6ecaf13c8"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://kernel.dance/b80b829e9e2c1b3f7aae34855e04d8f6ecaf13c8"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/01/msg00004.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5492"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
