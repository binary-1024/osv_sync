Versions 0.2.3 and prior do not verify the returned data packets, and there is a deserialization vulnerability which may lead to remote code execution. When weblogic-framework gets the command echo, it directly deserializes the data returned by the server without verifying it. At the same time, the classloader loads a lot of deserialization calls. In this case, the malicious serialized data returned by the server will cause remote code execution. Version 0.2.4 contains a patch for this issue.\n\n","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-40571.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.2.4"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/dream0x01/weblogic-framework/security/advisories/GHSA-hjwj-4f3q-44h3"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://github.com/dream0x01/weblogic-framework/releases/tag/v0.2.4"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
