The Samba smbd file server must map Windows group identities (SIDs) into unix group ids (gids). The code that performs this had a flaw that could allow it to read data beyond the end of the array in the case where a negative cache entry had been added to the mapping cache. This could cause the calling code to return those values into the process token that stores the group membership for a user. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.(CVE-2021-20254)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in Samba&apos;s libldb. Multiple, consecutive leading spaces in an LDAP attribute can lead to an out-of-bounds memory write, leading to a crash of the LDAP server process handling the request. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-20277)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in samba. Spaces used in a string around a domain name (DN), while supposed to be ignored, can cause invalid DN strings with spaces to instead write a zero-byte into out-of-bounds memory, resulting in a crash.
