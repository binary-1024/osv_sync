QuerySet.values() and values_list() methods on models with a\nJSONField are subject to SQL injection in column aliases via a crafted\nJSON object key as a passed *arg. (CVE-2024-42005)\nAn issue was discovered in Django 5.1 before 5.1.1, 5.0 before 5.0.9,\nand 4.2 before 4.2.16. The urlize() and urlizetrunc() template filters\nare subject to a potential denial-of-service attack via very large\ninputs with a specific sequence of characters. (CVE-2024-45230)\nAn issue was discovered in Django v5.1.1, v5.0.9, and v4.2.16. The\ndjango.contrib.auth.forms.PasswordResetForm class, when used in a view\nimplementing password reset flows, allows remote attackers to enumerate\nuser e-mail addresses by sending password reset requests and observing\nthe outcome (only when e-mail sending is consistently failing).\n(CVE-2024-45231)\nAn issue was discovered in Django 5.1 before 5.1.4, 5.0 before 5.0.10,\nand 4.2 before 4.2.17.

Direct usage of the\ndjango.db.models.fields.json.HasKey lookup, when an Oracle database is\nused, is subject to SQL injection if untrusted data is used as an lhs\nvalue. (CVE-2024-53908)\nAn issue was discovered in Django 5.1 before 5.1.5, 5.0 before 5.0.11,\nand 4.2 before 4.2.18. Lack of upper-bound limit enforcement in strings\npassed when performing IPv6 validation could lead to a potential\ndenial-of-service attack. The undocumented and private functions\nclean_ipv6_address and is_valid_ipv6_address are vulnerable, as is the\ndjango.forms.GenericIPAddressField form field. (CVE-2024-56374)\n",
