  "details": "Vulnerability in the Java Advanced Management Console component of\nOracle Java SE (subcomponent: Server). The supported version that is\naffected is Java Advanced Management Console: 2.12. Easily exploitable\nvulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via\nmultiple protocols to compromise Java Advanced Management Console.\nSuccessful attacks require human interaction from a person other than\nthe attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java Advanced Management\nConsole, attacks may significantly impact additional products.\nSuccessful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized\nupdate, insert or delete access to some of Java Advanced Management\nConsole accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset\nof Java Advanced Management Console accessible data. (CVE-2019-2540)\n\nAn issue was discovered in libjpeg 9a. The alloc_sarray function in\njmemmgr.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n(divide-by-zero error) via a crafted file. (CVE-2018-11212)\n\nVulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:\nNetworking). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u201,\n8u192 and 11.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u191. Difficult to exploit\nvulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via\nmultiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks of this\nvulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java\nSE accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments,\ntypically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or\nsandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code\n(e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox\nfor security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in\nthe specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data\nto the APIs. (CVE-2019-2426)\n\nVulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:\nDeployment). The supported version that is affected is Java SE: 8u192.\nDifficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with\nnetwork access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful\nattacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker.\nSuccessful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized\nability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE.\nNote: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in\nclients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java\napplets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code\nthat comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security.\nThis vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in\nservers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by\nan administrator). (CVE-2019-2449)\n\nVulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:\nLibraries). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u201,\n8u192 and 11.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u191. Difficult to exploit\nvulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via\nmultiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require\nhuman interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful\nattacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to\na subset of Java SE accessible data.
