  "details": "Libcue is intended for parsing a so-called cue sheet from a char string or a file pointer. For handling of the parsed data a convenient API is available.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nlibcue provides an API for parsing and extracting data from CUE sheets. Versions 2.2.1 and prior are vulnerable to out-of-bounds array access. A user of the GNOME desktop environment can be exploited by downloading a cue sheet from a malicious webpage. Because the file is saved to `~/Downloads`, it is then automatically scanned by tracker-miners. And because it has a .cue filename extension, tracker-miners use libcue to parse the file. The file exploits the vulnerability in libcue to gain code execution. This issue is patched in version 2.3.0.(CVE-2023-43641)",
