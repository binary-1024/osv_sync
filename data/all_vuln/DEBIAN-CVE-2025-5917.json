This flaw involves an 'off-by-one' miscalculation when handling prefixes and suffixes for file names. This can lead to a 1-byte write overflow. While seemingly small, such an overflow can corrupt adjacent memory, leading to unpredictable program behavior, crashes, or in specific circumstances, could be leveraged as a building block for more sophisticated exploitation.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libarchive","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libarchive?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.4.3-2","3.4.3-2+deb11u1","3.4.3-2+deb11u2","3.5.2-1","3.6.0-1","3.6.2-1","3.7.2-1","3.7.2-1.1","3.7.2-1.1~exp1","3.7.2-2","3.7.2-2.1","3.7.4-1","3.7.4-1.1","3.7.4-2","3.7.4-3","3.7.4-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-5917.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libarchive","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libarchive?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.2-1+deb12u3"}]}],"versions":["3.6.2-1","3.6.2-1+deb12u1","3.6.2-1+deb12u2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-5917.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libarchive","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libarchive?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.4-4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-5917.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libarchive","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libarchive?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.4-4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-5917.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-5917"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
