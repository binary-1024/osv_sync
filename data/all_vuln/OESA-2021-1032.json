You install it in front of any server that speaks HTTP and configure it to cache the contents. Varnish Cache is really, really fast. It typically speeds up delivery with a factor of 300 - 1000x, depending on your architecture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\\r\\n\\r\\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Varnish Cache before 6.0.4 LTS, and 6.1.x and 6.2.x before 6.2.1. An HTTP/1 parsing failure allows a remote attacker to trigger an assert by sending crafted HTTP/1 requests. The assert will cause an automatic restart with a clean cache, which makes it a Denial of Service attack.(CVE-2019-15892)\\r\\n\\r\\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"varnish","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/varnish&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.0-7.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["varnish-6.0.0-5.oe1.aarch64.rpm","varnish-debuginfo-6.0.0-5.oe1.aarch64.rpm","varnish-debugsource-6.0.0-5.oe1.aarch64.rpm","varnish-devel-6.0.0-5.oe1.aarch64.rpm","varnish-6.0.0-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","varnish-debuginfo-6.0.0-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","varnish-debugsource-6.0.0-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","varnish-devel-6.0.0-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["varnish-help-6.0.0-5.oe1.noarch.rpm","varnish-help-6.0.0-7.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["varnish-6.0.0-5.oe1.src.rpm","varnish-6.0.0-7.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["varnish-6.0.0-5.oe1.x86_64.rpm","varnish-debuginfo-6.0.0-5.oe1.x86_64.rpm","varnish-debugsource-6.0.0-5.oe1.x86_64.rpm","varnish-devel-6.0.0-5.oe1.x86_64.rpm","varnish-6.0.0-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","varnish-debuginfo-6.0.0-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","varnish-debugsource-6.0.0-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","varnish-devel-6.0.0-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1032.json"}},{"package":{"name":"varnish","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/varnish&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.0-7.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["varnish-6.0.0-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","varnish-debuginfo-6.0.0-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","varnish-debugsource-6.0.0-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","varnish-devel-6.0.0-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["varnish-help-6.0.0-7.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["varnish-6.0.0-7.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["varnish-6.0.0-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","varnish-debuginfo-6.0.0-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","varnish-debugsource-6.0.0-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","varnish-devel-6.0.0-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1032.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1032"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15892"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
