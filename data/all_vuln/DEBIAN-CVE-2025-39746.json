  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath10k: shutdown driver when hardware is unreliable  In rare cases, ath10k may lose connection with the PCIe bus due to some unknown reasons, which could further lead to system crashes during resuming due to watchdog timeout:  ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: wmi command 20486 timeout, restarting hardware ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: already restarting ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: failed to stop WMI vdev 0: -11 ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: failed to stop vdev 0: -11 ieee80211 phy0: PM: **** DPM device timeout **** Call Trace:  panic+0x125/0x315  dpm_watchdog_set+0x54/0x54  dpm_watchdog_handler+0x57/0x57  call_timer_fn+0x31/0x13c  At this point, all WMI commands will timeout and attempt to restart device. So set a threshold for consecutive restart failures. If the threshold is exceeded, consider the hardware is unreliable and all ath10k operations should be skipped to avoid system crash.  fail_cont_count and pending_recovery are atomic variables, and do not involve complex conditional logic. Therefore, even if recovery check and reconfig complete are executed concurrently, the recovery mechanism will not be broken.  Tested-on: QCA6174 hw3.2 PCI WLAN.RM.4.4.1-00288-QCARMSWPZ-1",
