  "details": "The patch issued by the D-Bus maintainers for CVE-2014-3636 was based on\nincorrect reasoning, and does not fully prevent the attack described as\n\"CVE-2014-3636 part A\", which is repeated below. Preventing that attack\nrequires raising the system dbus-daemon's RLIMIT_NOFILE (ulimit -n) to\na higher value.\n\nBy queuing up the maximum allowed number of fds, a malicious sender\ncould reach the system dbus-daemon's RLIMIT_NOFILE (ulimit -n, typically\n1024 on Linux). This would act as a denial of service in two ways:\n\n* new clients would be unable to connect to the dbus-daemon\n* when receiving a subsequent message from a non-malicious client that\n  contained a fd, dbus-daemon would receive the MSG_CTRUNC flag,\n  indicating that the list of fds was truncated; kernel fd-passing APIs\n  do not provide any way to recover from that, so dbus-daemon responds\n  to MSG_CTRUNC by disconnecting the sender, causing denial of service\n  to that sender.\n\nThis update resolves the issue (CVE-2014-7824).\n\nAlso default auth_timeout that was changed from 30s to 5s in MGASA-2014-0395,\nand raised to 20s in MGAA-2014-0182 is now changed back to 30s as there\nstill are reports about failing dbus connections.\n",
