The vulnerable code may be part of the supply chain of a site's e-mail infrastructure (e.g., with additional configuration, Exim can use libspf2; the Postfix web site links to unofficial patches for use of libspf2 with Postfix; older versions of spfquery relied on libspf2) but most often is not.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libspf2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libspf2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.11-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.10-r0","1.2.10-r1","1.2.10-r2","1.2.10-r3","1.2.10-r4","1.2.10-r5","1.2.9-r0","1.2.9-r1","1.2.9-r2","1.2.9-r3","1.2.9-r4","1.2.9-r5","1.2.9-r6","1.2.9-r7","1.2.9-r8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-33912.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libspf2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libspf2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.11-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.10-r0","1.2.10-r1","1.2.10-r2","1.2.10-r3","1.2.10-r4","1.2.10-r5","1.2.10-r6","1.2.9-r0","1.2.9-r1","1.2.9-r2","1.2.9-r3","1.2.9-r4","1.2.9-r5","1.2.9-r6","1.2.9-r7","1.2.9-r8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-33912.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libspf2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libspf2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.11-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.10-r0","1.2.10-r1","1.2.10-r2","1.2.10-r3","1.2.10-r4","1.2.10-r5","1.2.10-r6","1.2.10-r7","1.2.9-r0","1.2.9-r1","1.2.9-r2","1.2.9-r3","1.2.9-r4","1.2.9-r5","1.2.9-r6","1.2.9-r7","1.2.9-r8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-33912.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libspf2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libspf2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.11-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.10-r0","1.2.10-r1","1.2.10-r2","1.2.10-r3","1.2.10-r4","1.2.10-r5","1.2.10-r6","1.2.10-r7","1.2.9-r0","1.2.9-r1","1.2.9-r2","1.2.9-r3","1.2.9-r4","1.2.9-r5","1.2.9-r6","1.2.9-r7","1.2.9-r8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-33912.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libspf2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libspf2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.11-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.10-r0","1.2.10-r1","1.2.10-r2","1.2.10-r3","1.2.10-r4","1.2.10-r5","1.2.10-r6","1.2.10-r7","1.2.9-r0","1.2.9-r1","1.2.9-r2","1.2.9-r3","1.2.9-r4","1.2.9-r5","1.2.9-r6","1.2.9-r7","1.2.9-r8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-33912.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libspf2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libspf2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.11-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.10-r0","1.2.10-r1","1.2.10-r2","1.2.10-r3","1.2.10-r4","1.2.10-r5","1.2.10-r6","1.2.10-r7","1.2.9-r0","1.2.9-r1","1.2.9-r2","1.2.9-r3","1.2.9-r4","1.2.9-r5","1.2.9-r6","1.2.9-r7","1.2.9-r8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-33912.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libspf2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libspf2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.11-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.10-r0","1.2.10-r1","1.2.10-r2","1.2.10-r3","1.2.10-r4","1.2.10-r5","1.2.10-r6","1.2.10-r7","1.2.9-r0","1.2.9-r1","1.2.9-r2","1.2.9-r3","1.2.9-r4","1.2.9-r5","1.2.9-r6","1.2.9-r7","1.2.9-r8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-33912.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libspf2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libspf2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.11-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.10-r0","1.2.10-r1","1.2.10-r2","1.2.10-r3","1.2.10-r4","1.2.10-r5","1.2.10-r6","1.2.10-r7","1.2.9-r0","1.2.9-r1","1.2.9-r2","1.2.9-r3","1.2.9-r4","1.2.9-r5","1.2.9-r6","1.2.9-r7","1.2.9-r8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-33912.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libspf2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libspf2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.11-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.10-r0","1.2.10-r1","1.2.10-r2","1.2.10-r3","1.2.10-r4","1.2.10-r5","1.2.10-r6","1.2.10-r7","1.2.9-r0","1.2.9-r1","1.2.9-r2","1.2.9-r3","1.2.9-r4","1.2.9-r5","1.2.9-r6","1.2.9-r7","1.2.9-r8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-33912.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2021-33912"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
