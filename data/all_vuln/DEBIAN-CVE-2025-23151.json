{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-23151","published":"2025-05-01T13:15:51Z","modified":"2025-11-06T11:15:51.765305Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-23151"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bus: mhi: host: Fix race between unprepare and queue_buf  A client driver may use mhi_unprepare_from_transfer() to quiesce incoming data during the client driver's tear down. The client driver might also be processing data at the same time, resulting in a call to mhi_queue_buf() which will invoke mhi_gen_tre(). If mhi_gen_tre() runs after mhi_unprepare_from_transfer() has torn down the channel, a panic will occur due to an invalid dereference leading to a page fault.  This occurs because mhi_gen_tre() does not verify the channel state after locking it. Fix this by having mhi_gen_tre() confirm the channel state is valid, or return error to avoid accessing deinitialized data.
