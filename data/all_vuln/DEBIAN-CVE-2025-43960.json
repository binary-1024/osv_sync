Remote, unauthenticated attackers can trigger this by sending a malicious serialized object, which forces excessive memory usage, rendering Adminer’s interface unresponsive and causing a server-level DoS. While the server may recover after several minutes, multiple simultaneous requests can cause a complete crash requiring manual intervention.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"adminer","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/adminer?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.7.9-2","4.8.1-1","4.8.1-2","4.8.1-4","5.1.0-1","5.2.1+dfsg-1","5.3.0+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-43960.json"}},{"package":{"name":"adminer","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/adminer?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.8.1-1","4.8.1-2","4.8.1-4","5.1.0-1","5.2.1+dfsg-1","5.3.0+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-43960.json"}},{"package":{"name":"adminer","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/adminer?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.2.1+dfsg-1","5.3.0+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-43960.json"}},{"package":{"name":"adminer","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/adminer?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.2.1+dfsg-1","5.3.0+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-43960.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-43960"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L"}]}
