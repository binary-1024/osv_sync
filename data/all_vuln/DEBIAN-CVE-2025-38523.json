  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cifs: Fix the smbd_response slab to allow usercopy  The handling of received data in the smbdirect client code involves using copy_to_iter() to copy data from the smbd_reponse struct's packet trailer to a folioq buffer provided by netfslib that encapsulates a chunk of pagecache.  If, however, CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY=y, this will result in the checks then performed in copy_to_iter() oopsing with something like the following:   CIFS: Attempting to mount //172.31.9.1/test  CIFS: VFS: RDMA transport established  usercopy: Kernel memory exposure attempt detected from SLUB object 'smbd_response_0000000091e24ea1' (offset 81, size 63)!  ------------[ cut here ]------------  kernel BUG at mm/usercopy.c:102!  ...

Fix this by passing parameters to kmem_slab_create() to indicate that copy_to_iter() is permitted from the packet region of the smbd_response slab objects, less the header space.",
