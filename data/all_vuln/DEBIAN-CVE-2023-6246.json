This function is called by the syslog and vsyslog functions.

This issue affects glibc 2.36 and newer.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"glibc","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/glibc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.36-9+deb12u4"}]}],"versions":["2.36-9","2.36-9+deb12u1","2.36-9+deb12u2","2.36-9+deb12u3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-6246.json"}},{"package":{"name":"glibc","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/glibc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.37-15"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-6246.json"}},{"package":{"name":"glibc","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/glibc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.37-15"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-6246.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-6246"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
