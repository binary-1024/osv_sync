  "details": "The iputils package contains basic utilities for monitoring a network, including ping. The ping command sends a series of ICMP protocol ECHO_REQUEST packets to a specified network host to discover whether the target machine is alive and receiving network traffic.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nping in iputils before 20250602 allows a denial of service (application error in adaptive ping mode or incorrect data collection) via a crafted ICMP Echo Reply packet, because a zero timestamp can lead to large intermediate values that have an integer overflow when squared during statistics calculations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2025-47268 (that fix was only about timestamp calculations, and it did not account for a specific scenario where the original timestamp in the ICMP payload is zero).(CVE-2025-48964)",
