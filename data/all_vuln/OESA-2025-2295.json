The ping command sends a series of ICMP protocol ECHO_REQUEST packets to a specified network host to discover whether the target machine is alive and receiving network traffic.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nping in iputils before 20250602 allows a denial of service (application error in adaptive ping mode or incorrect data collection) via a crafted ICMP Echo Reply packet, because a zero timestamp can lead to large intermediate values that have an integer overflow when squared during statistics calculations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2025-47268 (that fix was only about timestamp calculations, and it did not account for a specific scenario where the original timestamp in the ICMP payload is zero).(CVE-2025-48964)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"iputils","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/iputils&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"20221126-8.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["iputils-20221126-8.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","iputils-debuginfo-20221126-8.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","iputils-debugsource-20221126-8.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["iputils-help-20221126-8.oe2403.noarch.rpm"],"src":["iputils-20221126-8.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["iputils-20221126-8.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","iputils-debuginfo-20221126-8.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","iputils-debugsource-20221126-8.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2295.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2295"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48964"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
