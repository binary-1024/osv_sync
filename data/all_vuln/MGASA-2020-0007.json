  "details": "Updated freeradius packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nIt was discovered freeradius does not correctly configure logrotate,\nallowing a local attacker who already has control of the radiusd user to\nescalate his privileges to root, by tricking logrotate into writing a\nradiusd-writable file to a directory normally inaccessible by the radiusd\n user (CVE-2019-10143).\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the implementation of EAP-pwd in\nfreeradius. An attacker could initiate several EAP-pwd handshakes to leak\ninformation, which can then be used to recover the user's WiFi password by\nperforming dictionary and brute-force attacks (CVE-2019-13456).\n\nDenial of service issues due to multithreaded BN_CTX access\n(CVE-2019-17185).\n",
