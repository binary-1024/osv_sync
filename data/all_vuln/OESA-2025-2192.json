The latest version of the TIFF specification is available on-line in several different formats.And contains command-line programs for manipulating TIFF format image files using the libtiff library.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability was found in LibTIFF up to version 4.5.1. The issue affects the readSeparateStripsetoBuffer function in the tools/tiffcrop.c file of the tiffcrop component. The manipulation leads to a stack-based buffer overflow. Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.(CVE-2025-8851)\n\nA flaw has been found in LibTIFF 4.7.0. This affects the function _TIFFmallocExt/_TIFFCheckRealloc/TIFFHashSetNew/InitCCITTFax3 of the file tools/tiffcmp.c of the component tiffcmp. Executing manipulation can lead to memory leak. The attack is restricted to local execution. The exploit has been published and may be used.(CVE-2025-9165)",
