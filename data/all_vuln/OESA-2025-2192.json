The latest version of the TIFF specification is available on-line in several different formats.And contains command-line programs for manipulating TIFF format image files using the libtiff library.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability was found in LibTIFF up to version 4.5.1. The issue affects the readSeparateStripsetoBuffer function in the tools/tiffcrop.c file of the tiffcrop component. The manipulation leads to a stack-based buffer overflow. Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.(CVE-2025-8851)\n\nA flaw has been found in LibTIFF 4.7.0. This affects the function _TIFFmallocExt/_TIFFCheckRealloc/TIFFHashSetNew/InitCCITTFax3 of the file tools/tiffcmp.c of the component tiffcmp. Executing manipulation can lead to memory leak. The attack is restricted to local execution. The exploit has been published and may be used.(CVE-2025-9165)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libtiff","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/libtiff&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.3.0-43.oe2203sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libtiff-4.3.0-43.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","libtiff-debuginfo-4.3.0-43.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","libtiff-debugsource-4.3.0-43.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","libtiff-devel-4.3.0-43.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","libtiff-static-4.3.0-43.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","libtiff-tools-4.3.0-43.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["libtiff-help-4.3.0-43.oe2203sp4.noarch.rpm"],"src":["libtiff-4.3.0-43.oe2203sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libtiff-4.3.0-43.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","libtiff-debuginfo-4.3.0-43.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","libtiff-debugsource-4.3.0-43.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","libtiff-devel-4.3.0-43.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","libtiff-static-4.3.0-43.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","libtiff-tools-4.3.0-43.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2192.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2192"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-8851"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-9165"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
