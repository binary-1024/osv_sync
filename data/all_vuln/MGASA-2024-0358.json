  "details": "An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in mpg123 when handling crafted\nstreams. When decoding PCM, the libmpg123 may write past the end of a\nheap-located buffer. Consequently, heap corruption may happen, and\narbitrary code execution may not be dismissed. The complexity required to\nexploit this flaw is considered high as the payload must be validated by\nthe MPEG decoder and the PCM synth before execution. Additionally, to\nsuccessfully execute the attack, the user must scan through the stream,\nmaking web live stream content (such as web radios) a very unlikely\nattack vector. (CVE-2024-10573)\n",
