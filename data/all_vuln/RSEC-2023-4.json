  "details": "The igraph R package, through version 0.7.1, is susceptible to a vulnerability identified in the igraph_i_strdiff function within igraph_trie.c. This vulnerability can lead to a NULL pointer dereference, potentially exploited by attackers to cause a denial of service, resulting in an application crash. Users of the igraph package should take necessary precautions and consider updating to a patched version to mitigate this security risk.",
