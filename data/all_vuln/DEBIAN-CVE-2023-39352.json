Affected versions are subject to an invalid offset validation leading to Out Of Bound Write. This can be triggered when the values `rect->left` and `rect->top` are exactly equal to `surface->width` and  `surface->height`. eg. `rect->left` == `surface->width` && `rect->top` == `surface->height`. In practice this should cause a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"freerdp2","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/freerdp2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.3.0+dfsg1-2+deb11u2"}]}],"versions":["2.3.0+dfsg1-2","2.3.0+dfsg1-2+deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-39352.json"}},{"package":{"name":"freerdp2","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/freerdp2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.11.7+dfsg1-6~deb12u1"}]}],"versions":["2.10.0+dfsg1-1","2.10.0+dfsg1-1.1","2.11.2+dfsg1-1","2.11.2+dfsg1-1.1~exp1","2.11.2+dfsg1-1.1~exp2","2.11.5+dfsg1-1","2.11.7+dfsg1-1","2.11.7+dfsg1-2","2.11.7+dfsg1-3","2.11.7+dfsg1-4","2.11.7+dfsg1-5"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-39352.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-39352"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
