  "details": "Updated tomcat6 packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nIt was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled certain requests\nsubmitted using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use this\nflaw to cause the Tomcat server to stop responding, resulting in a denial\nof service (CVE-2012-3544).\n\nA frame injection in the Javadoc component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 21\nand earlier, 6 Update 45 and earlier, and 5.0 Update 45 and earlier;\nJavaFX 2.2.21 and earlier; and OpenJDK 7 allows remote attackers to affect\nintegrity via unknown vectors related to Javadoc (CVE-2013-1571)\n\nA flaw was found in the way the tomcat6 init script handled the\ntomcat6-initd.log log file. A malicious web application deployed on Tomcat\ncould use this flaw to perform a symbolic link attack to change the\nownership of an arbitrary system file to that of the tomcat user, allowing\nthem to escalate their privileges to root (CVE-2013-1976).\n\nIt was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled certain authentication\nrequests. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject a\nrequest that would get executed with a victim's credentials (CVE-2013-2067).\n\nNote: With this update, tomcat6-initd.log has been moved from\n/var/log/tomcat6/ to the /var/log/ directory.\n",
