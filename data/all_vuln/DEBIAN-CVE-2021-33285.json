The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bound buffer access which can be triggered by mounting a crafted ntfs partition. The root cause is a missing consistency check after reading an MFT record : the \"bytes_in_use\" field should be less than the \"bytes_allocated\" field. When it is not, the parsing of the records proceeds into the wild.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ntfs-3g","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ntfs-3g?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:2017.3.23AR.3-4+deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["1:2017.3.23AR.3-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-33285.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ntfs-3g","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ntfs-3g?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:2021.8.22-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-33285.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ntfs-3g","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ntfs-3g?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:2021.8.22-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-33285.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ntfs-3g","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ntfs-3g?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:2021.8.22-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-33285.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33285"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
