  "details": "Due to use of a dangling pointer, libcurl 7.29.0 through 7.71.1 can use the\nwrong connection when sending data. (CVE-2020-8231).\n\nA malicious server can use the FTP PASV response to trick curl 7.73.0 and\nearlier into connecting back to a given IP address and port, and this way\npotentially make curl extract information about services that are otherwise\nprivate and not disclosed, for example doing port scanning and service banner\nextractions. (CVE-2020-8284).\n\ncurl 7.21.0 to and including 7.73.0 is vulnerable to uncontrolled recursion\ndue to a stack overflow issue in FTP wildcard match parsing. (CVE-2020-8285).\n\ncurl 7.41.0 through 7.73.0 is vulnerable to an improper check for certificate\nrevocation due to insufficient verification of the OCSP response.\n(CVE-2020-8286).\n",
