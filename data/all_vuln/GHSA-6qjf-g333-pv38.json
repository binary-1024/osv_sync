  "details": "### Impact\nThere is an arbitrary code execution vulnerability in the `CsvEnumerator` class of the `job-iteration` repository. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system where the application is running, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or complete system compromise.\n\n### Patches\nIssue is fixed in versions `1.11.0` and above.\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers can mitigate the risk by avoiding the use of untrusted input in the `CsvEnumerator` class and ensuring that any file paths are properly sanitized and validated before being passed to the class methods. Users should avoid calling `size` on enumerators constructed with untrusted CSV filenames.",
