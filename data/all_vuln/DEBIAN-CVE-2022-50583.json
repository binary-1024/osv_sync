And there is a bug. If all member disks are rotational devices, raid0/raid10 set max_discard_sectors. So the member devices are not ssd/nvme, but raid0/raid10 export the wrong value. It reports warning messages in function __blkdev_issue_discard when mkfs.xfs like this:  [ 4616.022599] ------------[ cut here ]------------ [ 4616.027779] WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 99634 at
