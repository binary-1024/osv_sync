It has a limited risk.\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (70e23b9f24c3e54fdfd5401ba60ac7654941a3274ac3063c656d4d2f482dd3d4)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'artifact-lab-3-package-24ddbc49' @ 0.7.0 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package-24ddbc49","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-24ddbc49"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.7.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-24ddbc49/MAL-2024-9451.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package-24ddbc49"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-10-22T16:38:38.659593337Z","modified_time":"2024-10-22T16:31:18Z","sha256":"70e23b9f24c3e54fdfd5401ba60ac7654941a3274ac3063c656d4d2f482dd3d4","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["0.7.0"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-24ddbc49","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.917223891Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"fb68b9e5134ebcb9845f29635d2a85b90c7f161816927c6c248c0c463f102cf3","source":"kam193"}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
