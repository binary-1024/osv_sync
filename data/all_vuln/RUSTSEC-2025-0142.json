The function does not sufficiently validate the input buffer structure before processing, leading to out-of-bounds reads.\n\nThis vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (segmentation fault) or potentially read unmapped memory by providing a malformed Netlink message.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mnl","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/mnl"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":[],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":["memory-corruption"],"cvss":null,"informational":null,"source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2025-0142.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/mnl"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0142.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/mullvad/mnl-rs/issues/15"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"}}
