The VM_BIND interface allows partial unmapping of a BO.  Panthor driver pre-allocates memory for the new drm_gpuva structures that would be needed for the map/unmap operation, done using drm_gpuvm layer. It expected that only one new drm_gpuva would be needed on umap but a partial unmap can require 2 new drm_gpuva and that's why it ended up doing a NULL pointer dereference causing a kernel panic.  Following dump was seen when partial unmap was exercised.
