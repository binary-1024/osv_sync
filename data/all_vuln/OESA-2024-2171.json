The server reads an unbounded number of bytes from a single connection, exploiting the lack of limitations on chunk extension bytes. The issue can cause CPU and network bandwidth exhaustion, bypassing standard safeguards like timeouts and body size limits.(CVE-2024-22019)\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in Node.js has been identified, allowing for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack through resource exhaustion when using the fetch() function to retrieve content from an untrusted URL.\nThe vulnerability stems from the fact that the fetch() function in Node.js always decodes Brotli, making it possible for an attacker to cause resource exhaustion when fetching content from an untrusted URL.\nAn attacker controlling the URL passed into fetch() can exploit this vulnerability to exhaust memory, potentially leading to process termination, depending on the system configuration.(CVE-2024-22025)\r\n\r\nThe team has identified a critical vulnerability in the http server of the most recent version of Node, where malformed headers can lead to HTTP request smuggling. Specifically, if a space is placed before a content-length header, it is not interpreted correctly, enabling attackers to smuggle in a second request within the body of the first.(CVE-2024-27982)\r\n\r\nAn attacker can make the Node.js HTTP/2 server completely unavailable by sending a small amount of HTTP/2 frames packets with a few HTTP/2 frames inside. It is possible to leave some data in nghttp2 memory after reset when headers with HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frame are sent to the server and then a TCP connection is abruptly closed by the client triggering the Http2Session destructor while header frames are still being processed (and stored in memory) causing a race condition.(CVE-2024-27983)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nodejs","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/nodejs&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"12.22.11-10.oe2203sp3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["nodejs-12.22.11-10.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-debuginfo-12.22.11-10.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-debugsource-12.22.11-10.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-devel-12.22.11-10.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-full-i18n-12.22.11-10.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-libs-12.22.11-10.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","npm-6.14.16-1.12.22.11.10.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","v8-devel-7.8.279.23-1.12.22.11.10.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["nodejs-docs-12.22.11-10.oe2203sp3.noarch.rpm"],"src":["nodejs-12.22.11-10.oe2203sp3.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["nodejs-12.22.11-10.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","nodejs-debuginfo-12.22.11-10.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","nodejs-debugsource-12.22.11-10.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","nodejs-devel-12.22.11-10.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","nodejs-full-i18n-12.22.11-10.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","nodejs-libs-12.22.11-10.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","npm-6.14.16-1.12.22.11.10.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","v8-devel-7.8.279.23-1.12.22.11.10.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-2171.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2024-2171"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46809"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22019"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22025"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27982"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27983"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
