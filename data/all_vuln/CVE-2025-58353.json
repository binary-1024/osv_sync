All versions of Promptcraft Forge Studio sanitize user input using regex blacklists such as r`eplace(/javascript:/gi, '')`. Because the package uses multi-character tokens and each replacement is applied only once, removing one occurrence can create a new dangerous token due to overlap. The “sanitized” value may still contain an executable payload when used in href/src (or injected into the DOM). There is currently no fix for this issue.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-58353.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":">= 0"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/MarceloTessaro/promptcraft-forge-studio/security/advisories/GHSA-mv25-7v95-q3pf"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N"}]}
