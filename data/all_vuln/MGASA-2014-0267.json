  "details": "In cups-filters before 1.0.53, out-of-bounds accesses in the\nprocess_browse_data function when reading the packet variable could\nleading to a crash, thus resulting in a denial of service \n(CVE-2014-4337).\n\nIn cups-filters before 1.0.53, if there was only a single BrowseAllow\nline in cups-browsed.conf and its host specification was invalid, this\nwas interpreted as if no BrowseAllow line had been specified, which\nresulted in it accepting browse packets from all hosts (CVE-2014-4338).\n\nThe CVE-2014-2707 issue with malicious broadcast packets, which had been\nfixed in Mageia Bug 13216 (MGASA-2014-0181), had not been completely\nfixed by that update. A more complete fix was implemented in\ncups-filters 1.0.53 (CVE-2014-4336).\n\nNote that only systems that have enabled the affected feature by using\nthe CreateIPPPrinterQueues configuration directive in\n/etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf were affected by the CVE-2014-2707 / \nCVE-2014-4336 issue.\n",
