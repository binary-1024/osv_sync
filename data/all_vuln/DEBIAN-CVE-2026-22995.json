{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22995","published":"2026-01-23T16:15:55.603Z","modified":"2026-01-24T11:18:21.095229Z","upstream":["CVE-2026-22995"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ublk: fix use-after-free in ublk_partition_scan_work  A race condition exists between the async partition scan work and device teardown that can lead to a use-after-free of ub->ub_disk:  1. ublk_ctrl_start_dev() schedules partition_scan_work after add_disk() 2. ublk_stop_dev() calls ublk_stop_dev_unlocked() which does:    - del_gendisk(ub->ub_disk)    - ublk_detach_disk() sets ub->ub_disk = NULL    - put_disk() which may free the disk 3. The worker ublk_partition_scan_work() then dereferences ub->ub_disk    leading to UAF  Fix this by using ublk_get_disk()/ublk_put_disk() in the worker to hold a reference to the disk during the partition scan. The spinlock in ublk_get_disk() synchronizes with ublk_detach_disk() ensuring the worker either gets a valid reference or sees NULL and exits early.  Also change flush_work() to cancel_work_sync() to avoid running the partition scan work unnecessarily when the disk is already detached.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.57-1","6.12.57-1~bpo12+1","6.12.63-1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.10-1","6.16.11-1","6.16.12-1","6.16.12-1~bpo13+1","6.16.12-2","6.16.3-1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16.5-1","6.16.6-1","6.16.7-1","6.16.8-1","6.16.9-1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1","6.17.10-1","6.17.11-1","6.17.12-1","6.17.13-1","6.17.13-1~bpo13+1","6.17.2-1~exp1","6.17.5-1~exp1","6.17.6-1","6.17.7-1","6.17.7-2","6.17.8-1","6.17.8-1~bpo13+1","6.17.9-1","6.18.1-1~exp1","6.18.2-1~exp1","6.18.3-1","6.18.5-1","6.18~rc4-1~exp1","6.18~rc4-1~exp2","6.18~rc5-1~exp1","6.18~rc6-1~exp1","6.18~rc7-1~exp1","6.19~rc4-1~exp1","6.19~rc5-1~exp1","6.19~rc6-1~exp1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22995.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2026-22995"}]}
