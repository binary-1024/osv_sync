It is a heap-based buffer over-read in a parse_mqtt getu16 call. A specially crafted MQTT SUBSCRIBE packet can cause an arbitrary out-of-bounds memory read potentially resulting in information disclosure and denial of service. An attacker needs to send a specially crafted MQTT packet over the network to trigger this vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"smplayer","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/smplayer@18.2.2~ds0-1?arch=source&distro=bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["17.7.0~ds0-1build1","17.8.0~ds0-1","17.8.0~ds0-1build1","17.11.2~ds0-1","18.2.2~ds0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"smplayer","binary_version":"18.2.2~ds0-1"},{"binary_name":"smplayer-l10n","binary_version":"18.2.2~ds0-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2018/UBUNTU-CVE-2018-18764.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-18764"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-18764"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
