  "details": "This kernel-tmb update is based on the upstream 4.14.18 and and adds some\nsupport for mitigating  Spectre, variant 1 (CVE-2017-5753) and as it is\nbuilt with the retpoline-aware gcc-5.5.0-1.mga6, it now provides full\nretpoline mitigation for Spectre, variant 2 (CVE-2017-5715).\n\nThe BPF interpreter has been used as part of the spectre 2 attack\nCVE-2017-5715. To make attacker job harder introduce BPF_JIT_ALWAYS_ON\nconfig option that removes interpreter from the kernel in favor of JIT-only\nmode. This is now enabled by default in Mageia kernels.\n\nOther security fixes in this update:\n\nLinux kernel version 3.3-rc1 and later is affected by a vulnerability lies\nin the processing of incoming L2CAP commands - ConfigRequest, and\nConfigResponse messages. This info leak is a result of uninitialized stack\nvariables that may be returned to an attacker in their uninitialized state.\nBy manipulating the code flows that precede the handling of these\nconfiguration messages, an attacker can also gain some control over which\ndata will be held in the uninitialized stack variables. This can allow him\nto bypass KASLR, and stack canaries protection - as both pointers and stack\ncanaries may be leaked in this manner (CVE-2017-1000410).\n\nThe dccp_disconnect function in net/dccp/proto.c in the Linux kernel through\n4.14.3 allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service\n(use-after-free) via an AF_UNSPEC connect system call during the DCCP_LISTEN\nstate (CVE-2017-8824).\n\nWireGuard has been updated to 0.0.20180202\n\nThis update also fixes the rtl8812au driver that got broken/missing in\nthe upgrade to 4.14 series kernels (mga#22524).\n\nFor other fixes in this update, read the referenced changelogs.\n",
