  "details": "A heap-buffer-overflow (off-by-one) flaw was found in the GnuTLS software in the template parsing logic within the certtool utility. When it reads certain settings from a template file, it allows an attacker to cause an out-of-bounds (OOB) NULL pointer write, resulting in memory corruption and a denial-of-service (DoS) that could potentially crash the system.",
