When verifying signatures with X509 certificate validation turned off and HMAC shared secret set (`signxml.XMLVerifier.verify(require_x509=False, hmac_key=...`), versions of SignXML prior to 4.0.4 are vulnerable to a potential algorithm confusion attack. Unless the user explicitly limits the expected signature algorithms using the `signxml.XMLVerifier.verify(expect_config=...)` setting, an attacker may supply a signature unexpectedly signed with a key other than the provided HMAC key, using a different (asymmetric key) signature algorithm. Starting with SignXML 4.0.4, specifying `hmac_key` causes the set of accepted signature algorithms to be restricted to HMAC only, if not already restricted by the user.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-signxml","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.10","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/python-signxml@4.0.5+dfsg-2?arch=source&distro=questing"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.0.3+dfsg-1","4.0.5+dfsg-1","4.0.5+dfsg-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"python3-signxml","binary_version":"4.0.5+dfsg-2"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-48994.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-signxml","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.04","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/python-signxml@4.0.3+dfsg-1?arch=source&distro=plucky"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.0.2+dfsg-1","4.0.3+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"python3-signxml","binary_version":"4.0.3+dfsg-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-48994.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-48994"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48994"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/XML-Security/signxml/security/advisories/GHSA-6vx8-pcwv-xhf4"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/XML-Security/signxml/commit/e3c0c2b82a3329a65d917830657649c98b8c7600"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
