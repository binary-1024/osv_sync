This involves team or bonding drivers ability to dynamically change their dev->needed_headroom and/or dev->hard_header_len  In this particular crash mld_newpack() allocated an skb with a too small reserve/headroom, and by the time mld_sendpack() was called, syzbot managed to attach an ipgre device.
