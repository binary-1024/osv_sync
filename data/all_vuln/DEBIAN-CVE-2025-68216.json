{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68216","published":"2025-12-16T14:15:54.627Z","modified":"2025-12-17T11:15:07.954395Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-68216"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  LoongArch: BPF: Disable trampoline for kernel module function trace  The current LoongArch BPF trampoline implementation is incompatible with tracing functions in kernel modules. This causes several severe and user-visible problems:  * The `bpf_selftests/module_attach` test fails consistently. * Kernel lockup when a BPF program is attached to a module function [1]. * Critical kernel modules like WireGuard experience traffic disruption   when their functions are traced with fentry [2].  Given the severity and the potential for other unknown side-effects, it is safest to disable the feature entirely for now. This patch prevents the BPF subsystem from allowing trampoline attachments to kernel module functions on LoongArch.  This is a temporary mitigation until the core issues in the trampoline code for kernel module handling can be identified and fixed.
