{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-39977","published":"2025-10-15T08:15:35Z","modified":"2025-10-23T05:16:43.660013Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-39977"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  futex: Prevent use-after-free during requeue-PI  syzbot managed to trigger the following race:     T1                               T2   futex_wait_requeue_pi()    futex_do_wait()      schedule()                                futex_requeue()                                  futex_proxy_trylock_atomic()                                    futex_requeue_pi_prepare()                                    requeue_pi_wake_futex()                                      futex_requeue_pi_complete()                                       /* preempt */           * timeout/ signal wakes T1 *     futex_requeue_pi_wakeup_sync() // Q_REQUEUE_PI_LOCKED    futex_hash_put()   // back to userland, on stack futex_q is garbage                                        /* back */                                      wake_up_state(q->task, TASK_NORMAL);  In this scenario futex_wait_requeue_pi() is able to leave without using futex_q::lock_ptr for synchronization.  This can be prevented by reading futex_q::task before updating the futex_q::requeue_state. A reference on the task_struct is not needed because requeue_pi_wake_futex() is invoked with a spinlock_t held which implies a RCU read section.  Even if T1 terminates immediately after, the task_struct will remain valid during T2's wake_up_state().  A READ_ONCE on futex_q::task before futex_requeue_pi_complete() is enough because it ensures that the variable is read before the state is updated.  Read futex_q::task before updating the requeue state, use it for the following wakeup.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.1.106-1","6.1.106-2","6.1.106-3","6.1.112-1","6.1.115-1","6.1.119-1","6.1.123-1","6.1.124-1","6.1.128-1","6.1.129-1","6.1.133-1","6.1.135-1","6.1.137-1","6.1.139-1","6.1.140-1","6.1.147-1","6.1.148-1","6.1.153-1","6.1.27-1","6.1.37-1","6.1.38-1","6.1.38-2","6.1.38-2~bpo11+1","6.1.38-3","6.1.38-4","6.1.38-4~bpo11+1","6.1.52-1","6.1.55-1","6.1.55-1~bpo11+1","6.1.64-1","6.1.66-1","6.1.67-1","6.1.69-1","6.1.69-1~bpo11+1","6.1.76-1","6.1.76-1~bpo11+1","6.1.82-1","6.1.85-1","6.1.90-1","6.1.90-1~bpo11+1","6.1.94-1","6.1.94-1~bpo11+1","6.1.98-1","6.1.99-1","6.10-1~exp1","6.10.1-1~exp1","6.10.11-1","6.10.11-1~bpo12+1","6.10.12-1","6.10.3-1","6.10.4-1","6.10.6-1","6.10.6-1~bpo12+1","6.10.7-1","6.10.9-1","6.11-1~exp1","6.11.10-1","6.11.10-1~bpo12+1","6.11.2-1","6.11.4-1","6.11.5-1","6.11.5-1~bpo12+1","6.11.6-1","6.11.7-1","6.11.9-1","6.11~rc4-1~exp1","6.11~rc5-1~exp1","6.12.10-1","6.12.11-1","6.12.11-1+alpha","6.12.11-1+alpha.1","6.12.12-1","6.12.12-1~bpo12+1","6.12.13-1","6.12.15-1","6.12.16-1","6.12.17-1","6.12.19-1","6.12.20-1","6.12.21-1","6.12.22-1","6.12.22-1~bpo12+1","6.12.25-1","6.12.27-1","6.12.27-1~bpo12+1","6.12.29-1","6.12.3-1","6.12.30-1","6.12.30-1~bpo12+1","6.12.31-1","6.12.32-1","6.12.32-1~bpo12+1","6.12.33-1","6.12.33-1~bpo12+1","6.12.35-1","6.12.35-1~bpo12+1","6.12.37-1","6.12.38-1","6.12.38-1~bpo12+1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.5-1","6.12.6-1","6.12.8-1","6.12.9-1","6.12.9-1+alpha","6.12.9-1~bpo12+1","6.12~rc6-1~exp1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.10-1","6.16.11-1","6.16.12-1","6.16.12-2","6.16.3-1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16.5-1","6.16.6-1","6.16.7-1","6.16.8-1","6.16.9-1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1","6.17.2-1~exp1","6.3.1-1~exp1","6.3.11-1","6.3.2-1~exp1","6.3.4-1~exp1","6.3.5-1~exp1","6.3.7-1","6.3.7-1~bpo12+1","6.4.1-1~exp1","6.4.11-1","6.4.13-1","6.4.4-1","6.4.4-1~bpo12+1","6.4.4-2","6.4.4-3","6.4.4-3~bpo12+1","6.4~rc6-1~exp1","6.4~rc7-1~exp1","6.5.1-1~exp1","6.5.10-1","6.5.10-1~bpo12+1","6.5.13-1","6.5.3-1","6.5.3-1~bpo12+1","6.5.6-1","6.5.8-1","6.5~rc4-1~exp1","6.5~rc6-1~exp1","6.5~rc7-1~exp1","6.6.11-1","6.6.13-1","6.6.13-1~bpo12+1","6.6.15-1","6.6.15-2","6.6.3-1~exp1","6.6.4-1~exp1","6.6.7-1~exp1","6.6.8-1","6.6.9-1","6.7-1~exp1","6.7.1-1~exp1","6.7.12-1","6.7.12-1~bpo12+1","6.7.4-1~exp1","6.7.7-1","6.7.9-1","6.7.9-2","6.8.11-1","6.8.12-1","6.8.12-1~bpo12+1","6.8.9-1","6.9.10-1","6.9.10-1~bpo12+1","6.9.11-1","6.9.12-1","6.9.2-1~exp1","6.9.7-1","6.9.7-1~bpo12+1","6.9.8-1","6.9.9-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not
