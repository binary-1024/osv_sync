In versions up to and including 1.5.0, the `pickle_operations` function in `monai/data/utils.py` automatically handles dictionary key-value pairs ending with a specific suffix and deserializes them using `pickle.loads()` . This function also lacks any security measures. The deserialization may lead to code execution. As of time of publication, no known fixed versions are available.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-58757.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/security/advisories/GHSA-p8cm-mm2v-gwjm"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-502"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
