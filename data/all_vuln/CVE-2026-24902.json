In `tcp_forwarder.rs`, SSRF protection for `allow_private_network_connections = false` was only applied in the `TcpDestination::HostName(peer)` path. The `TcpDestination::Address(peer) => peer` path proceeded to `TcpStream::connect()` without equivalent checks (for example `is_global_ip`, `is_loopback`), allowing loopback/private targets to be reached by supplying a numeric IP. The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.9.114.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/trusttunnel/trusttunnel","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"734bb5cf103b72390a95c853cbf91e699cc01bc0"}]}],"versions":["v0.9.100","v0.9.102","v0.9.105","v0.9.109","v0.9.20","v0.9.22","v0.9.23","v0.9.24","v0.9.26","v0.9.27","v0.9.38","v0.9.39","v0.9.40","v0.9.43","v0.9.47","v0.9.74","v0.9.96","v0.9.99"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24902.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24902.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/TrustTunnel/TrustTunnel/commit/734bb5cf103b72390a95c853cbf91e699cc01bc0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/TrustTunnel/TrustTunnel/security/advisories/GHSA-hgr9-frvw-5r76"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24902"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-918"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24902.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N"}]}
