  "details": "\nThis update provides Ceph 0.8.11, which fixes the following security issue:\n\n- CVE-2015-5245: A CRLF injection vulnerability in the Ceph Object Gateway (aka radosgw\n  or RGW) could allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and conduct\n  HTTP response splitting attacks via a crafted bucket name. (bsc#945206)\n\nThe following non-security issues have been fixed:\n\n- Move ceph-rbdnamer binary from package 'ceph' to 'ceph-common'. (bsc#965619)\n- Install /usr/bin/radosgw with mode 0750 and owner root:www. (bsc#964907)\n- Loop over all ceph-related systemd units on rpm removal. (bsc#941628)\n- Perform ceph-disk activate in separate systemd services, rather than in udev directly.\n  (bsc#926756)\n- Add hyphen to systemctl reload in logrotate.conf to avoid matching ceph.target.\n  (bsc#931451)\n\nCeph 0.8.11 also brings a significant number of bug fixes and enhancements. For a\ncomprehensive list please refer to the package's change log.\n",
