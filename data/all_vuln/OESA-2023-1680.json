This makes it suitable for &quot;machine to machine&quot; messaging such as with low power sensors or mobile devices such as phones, embedded computers or micro-controllers like the Arduino.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nThe broker in Eclipse Mosquitto 1.3.2 through 2.x before 2.0.16 has a memory leak that can be abused remotely when a client sends many QoS 2 messages with duplicate message IDs, and fails to respond to PUBREC commands.
