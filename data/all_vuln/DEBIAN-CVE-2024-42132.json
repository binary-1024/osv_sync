  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bluetooth/hci: disallow setting handle bigger than HCI_CONN_HANDLE_MAX  Syzbot hit warning in hci_conn_del() caused by freeing handle that was not allocated using ida allocator.  This is caused by handle bigger than HCI_CONN_HANDLE_MAX passed by hci_le_big_sync_established_evt(), which makes code think it's unset connection.  Add same check for handle upper bound as in hci_conn_set_handle() to prevent warning.",
