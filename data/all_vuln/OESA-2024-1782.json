  "details": "OpenSSH is the premier connectivity tool for remote login with the SSH protocol. \\ It encrypts all traffic to eliminate eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and \\ other attacks. In addition, OpenSSH provides a large suite of secure tunneling \\ capabilities, several authentication methods, and sophisticated configuration options.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA signal handler race condition was found in OpenSSH&apos;s server (sshd), where a client does not authenticate within LoginGraceTime seconds (120 by default, 600 in old OpenSSH versions), then sshd&apos;s SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously. However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog().(CVE-2024-6387)",
