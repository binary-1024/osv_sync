{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-27590","published":"2023-03-14T20:37:59.269Z","modified":"2025-12-12T02:56:53.829909Z","aliases":["GHSA-rqcp-m8m2-jcqf"],"summary":"Rizin has stack-based buffer overflow when parsing GDB registers profile files","details":"Rizin is a UNIX-like reverse engineering framework and command-line toolset. In version 0.5.1 and prior, converting a GDB registers profile file into a Rizin register profile can result in a stack-based buffer overflow when the `name`, `type`, or `groups` fields have longer values than expected. Users opening untrusted GDB registers files (e.g. with the `drpg` or `arpg` commands) are affected by this flaw. Commit d6196703d89c84467b600ba2692534579dc25ed4 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, review the GDB register profiles before loading them with `drpg`/`arpg` commands.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-27590.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/27xxx/CVE-2023-27590.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/blob/3a7d5116244beb678ad9950bb9dd27d28ed2691f/librz/reg/profile.c#L514"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/blob/3a7d5116244beb678ad9950bb9dd27d28ed2691f/librz/reg/profile.c#L545"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/commit/d6196703d89c84467b600ba2692534579dc25ed4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/pull/3422"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/security/advisories/GHSA-rqcp-m8m2-jcqf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WW3JXI4TIJIR7PGFP74SN7GQYHW2F46Y/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27590"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-120","CWE-121"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/27xxx/CVE-2023-27590.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
