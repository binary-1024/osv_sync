When an attacker sends the CREATE command with a malformed payload to KSMBD, due to a missing check of `NameOffset` in the `parse_lease_state()` function, the `create_context` object can access invalid memory.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-1194"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2154176"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231221-0006/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.spinics.net/lists/stable-commits/msg303065.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"}]}
