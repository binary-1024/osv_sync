A bug in on-headers versions `<1.1.0` may result in response headers being inadvertently modified when an array is passed to `response.writeHead()`. Users should upgrade to version 1.1.0 to receive a patch. Uses are strongly encouraged to upgrade to `1.1.0`, but this issue can be worked around by passing an object to `response.writeHead()` rather than an array.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"node-on-headers","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-on-headers?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.2-1","1.0.2-2","1.0.2-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-7339.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-on-headers","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-on-headers?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.2-2","1.0.2-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-7339.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-on-headers","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-on-headers?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.2-4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-7339.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-on-headers","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-on-headers?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.2-4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-7339.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-7339"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
