the following vulnerability has been\nresolved: e100: Fix possible use after free in e100_xmit_prepare In\ne100_xmit_prepare(), if we can't map the skb, then return -ENOMEM, so\ne100_xmit_frame() will return NETDEV_TX_BUSY and the upper layer will\nresend the skb.\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been\nresolved: macsec: fix UAF bug for real_dev Create a new macsec device but\nnot get reference to real_dev.\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been\nresolved: wifi: ath12k: fix firmware crash due to invalid peer nss\nCurrently, if the access point receives an association request containing\nan Extended HE Capabilities Information Element with an invalid MCS-NSS, it\ntriggers a firmware crash.\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been\nresolved: drm/xe/oa: Fix overflow in oa batch buffer By default\nxe_bb_create_job() appends a MI_BATCH_BUFFER_END to batch buffer, this is\nnot a problem if batch buffer is only used once but oa reuses the batch\nbuffer for the same metric and at each call it appends a\nMI_BATCH_BUFFER_END, printing the warning below and then overflowing.\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been\nresolved: NFSD: Prevent NULL dereference in nfsd4_process_cb_update() @ses\nis initialized to NULL.\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been\nresolved: KVM: Explicitly verify target vCPU is online in kvm_get_vcpu()\nExplicitly verify the target vCPU is fully online _prior_ to clamping the\nindex in kvm_get_vcpu().\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been\nresolved: sched: sch_cake: add bounds checks to host bulk flow fairness\ncounts Even though we fixed a logic error in the commit cited below, syzbot\nstill managed to trigger an underflow of the per-host bulk flow counters,\nleading to an out of bounds memory access.\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been\nresolved: net: sched: fix ets qdisc OOB Indexing Haowei Yan\n<g1042620637@gmail.com> found that ets_class_from_arg() can index an Out-\nOf-Bound class in ets_class_from_arg() when passed clid of 0.\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been\nresolved: usb: cdc-acm: Check control transfer buffer size before access If\nthe first fragment is shorter than struct usb_cdc_notification, we can't\ncalculate an expected_size.\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been\nresolved: net: davicom: fix UAF in dm9000_drv_remove dm is netdev private\ndata and it cannot be used after free_netdev() call.\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been\nresolved: exfat: fix random stack corruption after get_block When get_block\nis called with a buffer_head allocated on the stack, such as\ndo_mpage_readpage, stack corruption due to buffer_head UAF may occur in the\nfollowing race condition
