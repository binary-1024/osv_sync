It supports sections and (lists of) values (strings, integers, floats, booleans or other sections), as well as some other features (such as single/double-quoted strings, environment variable expansion, functions and nested include statements). It makes it very easy to add configuration file capability to a program using a simple API. The goal of libConfuse is not to be the configuration file parser library with a gazillion of features. Instead, it aims to be easy to use and quick to integrate with your code.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\ncfg_tilde_expand in confuse.c in libConfuse 3.3 has a heap-based buffer over-read.(CVE-2022-40320)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libconfuse","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/libconfuse&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.3-2.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libconfuse-debugsource-3.3-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libconfuse-devel-3.3-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libconfuse-debuginfo-3.3-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libconfuse-3.3-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["libconfuse-3.3-2.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libconfuse-devel-3.3-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libconfuse-debuginfo-3.3-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libconfuse-debugsource-3.3-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libconfuse-3.3-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1928.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libconfuse","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/libconfuse&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.3-2.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libconfuse-debugsource-3.3-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libconfuse-debuginfo-3.3-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libconfuse-devel-3.3-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libconfuse-3.3-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["libconfuse-3.3-2.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libconfuse-debugsource-3.3-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libconfuse-3.3-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libconfuse-debuginfo-3.3-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libconfuse-devel-3.3-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1928.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libconfuse","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/libconfuse&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.3-2.oe2203"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libconfuse-devel-3.3-2.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","libconfuse-debuginfo-3.3-2.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","libconfuse-debugsource-3.3-2.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","libconfuse-3.3-2.oe2203.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["libconfuse-3.3-2.oe2203.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libconfuse-devel-3.3-2.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","libconfuse-debugsource-3.3-2.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","libconfuse-3.3-2.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","libconfuse-debuginfo-3.3-2.oe2203.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1928.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2022-1928"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40320"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
