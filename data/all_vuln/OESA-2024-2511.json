Ansible works over SSH and does not require any software or daemons to be installed on remote nodes. Extension modules can be written in any language and are transferred to managed machines automatically. This package installs versions of ansible that execute on Python3. %endif\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in Ansible, where sensitive information stored in Ansible Vault files can be exposed in plaintext during the execution of a playbook. This occurs when using tasks such as include_vars to load vaulted variables without setting the no_log: true parameter, resulting in sensitive data being printed in the playbook output or logs. This can lead to the unintentional disclosure of secrets like passwords or API keys, compromising security and potentially allowing unauthorized access or actions.(CVE-2024-8775)\r\n\r\nThe ansible-core `user` module contains an exploitable flaw that can allow an unprivileged user to silently create or replace the contents of any file on any system path and take ownership of it when a privileged user executes the `user` module against the unprivileged user&apos;s home directory. If the unprivileged user has traversal permissions on the directory containing the exploited target file, they retain full control over the contents of the file as its owner.  Requirements to exploit (if any) - Someone with root privileges must use the `user` module with the`generate_ssh_key` option (disabled by default) and targeting an unprivileged user. - Access to the same unprivileged user on a system managed by the above automation.(CVE-2024-9902)",
