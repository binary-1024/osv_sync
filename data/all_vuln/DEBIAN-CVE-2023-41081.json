As of JK 1.2.49, the implicit mapping functionality has been removed and all mappings must now be via explicit configuration. Only mod_jk is affected by this issue. The ISAPI redirector is not affected.  This issue affects Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk only): from 1.2.0 through 1.2.48.  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.2.49, which fixes the issue.
