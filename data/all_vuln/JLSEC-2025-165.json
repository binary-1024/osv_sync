When a GDBus-based client subscribes to signals from a trusted system service such as NetworkManager on a shared computer, other users of the same computer can send spoofed D-Bus signals that the GDBus-based client will wrongly interpret as having been sent by the trusted system service. This could lead to the GDBus-based client behaving incorrectly, with an application-dependent impact.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"Glib_jll","ecosystem":"Julia","purl":"pkg:julia/Glib_jll?uuid=7746bdde-850d-59dc-9ae8-88ece973131d"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.80.2+0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/SecurityAdvisories.jl/tree/generated/osv/2025/JLSEC-2025-165.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/issues/3268"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/05/msg00008.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IRSFYAE5X23TNRWX7ZWEJOMISLCDSYNS/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LCDY3KA7G7D3DRXYTT46K6LFHS2KHWBH/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LL6HSJDXCXMLEIJBYV6CPOR4K2NTCTXW/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UNFJHISR4O6VFOHBFWH5I5WWMG37H63A/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240531-0008/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/07/5"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC-BY-4.0","sources":[{"html_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34397","id":"CVE-2024-34397","imported":"2025-10-19T21:13:25.672Z","modified":"2025-06-18T14:36:02.700Z","published":"2024-05-07T18:15:08.350Z","url":"https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2024-34397"}]}}
