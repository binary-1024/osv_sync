{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-58359","published":"2025-09-04T23:50:45Z","modified":"2025-11-10T19:56:40.842980Z","aliases":["GHSA-wgq8-vr6r-mqxm"],"summary":"frost-core: refresh shares with smaller min_signers will reduce group security","details":"ZF FROST is a Rust implementation of FROST (Flexible Round-Optimised Schnorr Threshold signatures). In versions 2.0.0 through 2.1.0, refresh shares with smaller min_signers will reduce security of group. The inability to change min_signers (i.e. the threshold) with the refresh share functionality (frost_core::keys::refresh module) was not made clear to users. Using a smaller value would not decrease the threshold, and attempts to sign using a smaller threshold would fail. Additionally, after refreshing the shares with a smaller threshold, it would still be possible to sign with the original threshold, potentially causing a security loss to the participant's shares. This issue is fixed in version 2.2.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zcashfoundation/frost","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"379ef689c733b3d9c80fd409071d4f3af4dafed2"}]}],"versions":["0.2.0","0.2.1","0.2.2","0.3.0","frost-core/v0.2.0","frost-core/v0.3.0","frost-core/v0.4.0","frost-core/v0.5.0","frost-core/v0.6.0","frost-core/v0.7.0","frost-core/v1.0.0","frost-core/v1.0.0-rc.0","frost-core/v2.0.0","frost-core/v2.0.0-rc.0","frost-core/v2.1.0","frost-ed25519/v0.2.0","frost-ed25519/v0.3.0","frost-ed25519/v0.4.0","frost-ed25519/v0.5.0","frost-ed25519/v0.6.0","frost-ed25519/v0.7.0","frost-ed25519/v1.0.0","frost-ed25519/v1.0.0-rc.0","frost-ed25519/v2.0.0","frost-ed25519/v2.0.0-rc.0","frost-ed25519/v2.1.0","frost-ed448/v0.1.0","frost-ed448/v0.2.0","frost-ed448/v0.3.0","frost-ed448/v0.4.0","frost-ed448/v0.5.0","frost-ed448/v0.6.0","frost-ed448/v0.7.0","frost-ed448/v1.0.0","frost-ed448/v1.0.0-rc.0","frost-ed448/v2.0.0","frost-ed448/v2.0.0-rc.0","frost-ed448/v2.1.0","frost-p256/v0.2.0","frost-p256/v0.3.0","frost-p256/v0.4.0","frost-p256/v0.5.0","frost-p256/v0.6.0","frost-p256/v0.7.0","frost-p256/v1.0.0","frost-p256/v1.0.0-rc.0","frost-p256/v2.0.0","frost-p256/v2.0.0-rc.0","frost-p256/v2.1.0","frost-rerandomized/v0.2.0","frost-rerandomized/v0.3.0","frost-rerandomized/v0.4.0","frost-rerandomized/v0.5.0","frost-rerandomized/v0.6.0","frost-rerandomized/v0.7.0","frost-rerandomized/v1.0.0","frost-rerandomized/v1.0.0-rc.0","frost-rerandomized/v2.0.0","frost-rerandomized/v2.0.0-rc.0","frost-rerandomized/v2.1.0","frost-ristretto255/v0.1.0","frost-ristretto255/v0.2.0","frost-ristretto255/v0.3.0","frost-ristretto255/v0.4.0","frost-ristretto255/v0.5.0","frost-ristretto255/v0.6.0","frost-ristretto255/v0.7.0","frost-ristretto255/v1.0.0","frost-ristretto255/v1.0.0-rc.0","frost-ristretto255/v2.0.0","frost-ristretto255/v2.0.0-rc.0","frost-ristretto255/v2.1.0","frost-secp256k1-tr/v2.1.0","frost-secp256k1/v0.2.0","frost-secp256k1/v0.3.0","frost-secp256k1/v0.4.0","frost-secp256k1/v0.5.0","frost-secp256k1/v0.6.0","frost-secp256k1/v0.7.0","frost-secp256k1/v1.0.0","frost-secp256k1/v1.0.0-rc.0","frost-secp256k1/v2.0.0","frost-secp256k1/v2.0.0-rc.0","frost-secp256k1/v2.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-58359.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/commit/379ef689c733b3d9c80fd409071d4f3af4dafed2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/releases/tag/frost-core%2Fv2.2.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/security/advisories/GHSA-wgq8-vr6r-mqxm"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-325"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
