For example TZMEM parts ('__scm->mempool') are initialized later in the probe, but users of it (__scm_smc_call()) rely on the '__scm' variable.  This fixes theoretical NULL pointer exception, triggered via introducing probe deferral in SCM driver with call trace:    qcom_tzmem_alloc+0x70/0x1ac (P)   qcom_tzmem_alloc+0x64/0x1ac (L)   qcom_scm_assign_mem+0x78/0x194   qcom_rmtfs_mem_probe+0x2d4/0x38c   platform_probe+0x68/0xc8","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.13-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-57985.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.13-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-57985.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-57985"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
