Symbols are held in the Interpreter symbol table &amp;apos;symtable&amp;apos;:  a simple dictionary supporting a simple, flat namespace. Expressions can be compiled into ast node for later evaluation, using the values in the symbol table current at evaluation time.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nASTEVAL is an evaluator of Python expressions and statements. Prior to version 1.0.6, if an attacker can control the input to the `asteval` library, they can bypass asteval&apos;s restrictions and execute arbitrary Python code in the context of the application using the library. The vulnerability is rooted in how `asteval` performs handling of `FormattedValue` AST nodes. In particular, the `on_formattedvalue` value uses the dangerous format method of the str class. The code allows an attacker to manipulate the value of the string used in the dangerous call `fmt.format(__fstring__=val)`. This vulnerability can be exploited to access protected attributes by intentionally triggering an `AttributeError` exception. The attacker can then catch the exception and use its `obj` attribute to gain arbitrary access to sensitive or protected object properties.
