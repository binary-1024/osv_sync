{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-54026","published":"2025-12-24T11:15:55.610Z","modified":"2025-12-25T11:13:24.247217Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-54026"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  opp: Fix use-after-free in lazy_opp_tables after probe deferral  When dev_pm_opp_of_find_icc_paths() in _allocate_opp_table() returns -EPROBE_DEFER, the opp_table is freed again, to wait until all the interconnect paths are available.  However, if the OPP table is using required-opps then it may already have been added to the global lazy_opp_tables list. The error path does not remove the opp_table from the list again.  This can cause crashes later when the provider of the required-opps is added, since we will iterate over OPP tables that have already been freed. E.g.:    Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference when read   CPU: 0 PID: 7 Comm: kworker/0:0 Not tainted 6.4.0-rc3   PC is at _of_add_opp_table_v2 (include/linux/of.h:949   drivers/opp/of.c:98 drivers/opp/of.c:344 drivers/opp/of.c:404   drivers/opp/of.c:1032) -> lazy_link_required_opp_table()  Fix this by calling _of_clear_opp_table() to remove the opp_table from the list and clear other allocated resources. While at it, also add the missing mutex_destroy() calls in the error path.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.52-1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.27-1","6.1.37-1","6.1.38-1","6.1.38-2","6.1.38-2~bpo11+1","6.1.38-3","6.1.38-4","6.1.38-4~bpo11+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-54026.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.4.11-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-54026.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.4.11-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-54026.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-54026"}]}
