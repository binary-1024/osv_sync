  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: don't set SB_RDONLY after filesystem errors\n\nWhen the filesystem is mounted with errors=remount-ro, we were setting\nSB_RDONLY flag to stop all filesystem modifications. We knew this misses\nproper locking (sb->s_umount) and does not go through proper filesystem\nremount procedure but it has been the way this worked since early ext2\ndays and it was good enough for catastrophic situation damage\nmitigation. Recently, syzbot has found a way (see link) to trigger\nwarnings in filesystem freezing because the code got confused by\nSB_RDONLY changing under its hands. Since these days we set\nEXT4_FLAGS_SHUTDOWN on the superblock which is enough to stop all\nfilesystem modifications, modifying SB_RDONLY shouldn't be needed. So\nstop doing that.",
