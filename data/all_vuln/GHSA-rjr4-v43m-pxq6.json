Protocols implementing their own verifier might be unaffected.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit 3a045d63, where the relevant randomness is sampled correctly.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"triton-vm","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/triton-vm"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.41.0"},{"fixed":"2.0.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-rjr4-v43m-pxq6/GHSA-rjr4-v43m-pxq6.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/TritonVM/triton-vm/commit/3a045d636e97bb2eb628671db0001aa665c19dd8"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/TritonVM/triton-vm"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/TritonVM/triton-vm/releases/tag/v2.0.0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2026-0004.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-330"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-21T22:52:56Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
