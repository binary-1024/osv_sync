{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49490","published":"2025-02-26T07:01:25Z","modified":"2025-10-23T09:03:42.293443Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-49490"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm/mdp5: Return error code in mdp5_pipe_release when deadlock is detected  mdp5_get_global_state runs the risk of hitting a -EDEADLK when acquiring the modeset lock, but currently mdp5_pipe_release doesn't check for if an error is returned. Because of this, there is a possibility of mdp5_pipe_release hitting a NULL dereference error.  To avoid this, let's have mdp5_pipe_release check if mdp5_get_global_state returns an error and propogate that error.  Changes since v1: - Separated declaration and initialization of *new_state to avoid   compiler warning - Fixed some spelling mistakes in commit message  Changes since v2: - Return 0 in case where hwpipe is NULL as this is considered normal   behavior - Added 2nd patch in series to fix a similar NULL dereference issue in   mdp5_mixer_release  Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/485179/","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.127-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.103-1","5.10.103-1~bpo10+1","5.10.106-1","5.10.113-1","5.10.120-1","5.10.120-1~bpo10+1","5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1","5.10.92-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49490.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49490.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49490.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49490.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-49490"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
