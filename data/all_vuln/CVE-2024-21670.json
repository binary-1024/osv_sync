The revocation schema that is part of the Ursa CL-Signatures implementations has a flaw that could impact the privacy guarantees defined by the AnonCreds verifiable credential model, allowing a malicious holder of a revoked credential to generate a valid Non-Revocation Proof for that credential as part of an AnonCreds presentation. A verifier may verify a credential from a holder as being \"not revoked\" when in fact, the holder's credential has been revoked. Ursa has moved to end-of-life status and no fix is expected.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-21670.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/21xxx/CVE-2024-21670.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/ursa/security/advisories/GHSA-r78f-4q2q-hvv4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21670"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-327"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/21xxx/CVE-2024-21670.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
