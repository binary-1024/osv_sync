  "details": "BlueZ is a Bluetooth protocol stack for Linux. In affected versions a\nvulnerability exists in sdp_cstate_alloc_buf which allocates memory which\nwill always be hung in the singly linked list of cstates and will not be\nfreed. This will cause a memory leak over time. The data can be a very\nlarge object, which can be caused by an attacker continuously sending sdp\npackets and this may cause the service of the target device to crash.\n(CVE-2021-41229)\n\nAn issue was discovered in gatt-database.c in BlueZ 5.61. A use-after-free\ncan occur when a client disconnects during D-Bus processing of a WriteValue\ncall. (CVE-2021-43400)\n",
