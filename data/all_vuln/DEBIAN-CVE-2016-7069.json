When dnsdist is configured to add EDNS Client Subnet to a query, the response may contain an EDNS0 OPT record that has to be removed before forwarding the response to the initial client. On a 32-bit system, the pointer arithmetic used when parsing the received response to remove that record might trigger an undefined behavior leading to a crash.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"dnsdist","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dnsdist?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"low"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2016-7069.json"}},{"package":{"name":"dnsdist","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dnsdist?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"low"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2016-7069.json"}},{"package":{"name":"dnsdist","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dnsdist?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"low"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2016-7069.json"}},{"package":{"name":"dnsdist","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dnsdist?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"low"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2016-7069.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7069"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
