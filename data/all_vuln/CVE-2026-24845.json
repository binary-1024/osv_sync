{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-24845","published":"2026-01-29T21:02:24.371Z","modified":"2026-01-30T22:50:12.078230Z","aliases":["GHSA-9m43-p3cx-w8j5"],"summary":"malcontent's OCI image scanning could expose registry credentials","details":"malcontent discovers supply-chain compromises through. context, differential analysis, and YARA. Starting in version 0.10.0 and prior to version 1.20.3, malcontent could be made to expose Docker registry credentials if it scanned a specially crafted OCI image reference. malcontent uses google/go-containerregistry for OCI image pulls, which by default uses the Docker credential keychain. A malicious registry could return a `WWW-Authenticate` header redirecting token authentication to an attacker-controlled endpoint, causing credentials to be sent to that endpoint. Version 1.20.3 fixes the issue by defaulting to anonymous auth for OCI pulls.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/chainguard-dev/malcontent","events":[{"introduced":"0e51840c48aa53ffe664a9226b8bdc3b4a4137c6"},{"fixed":"96faed538d6fdd5fc27e4a9b9ecff5385325ce54"}]}],"versions":["v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.13.2","v0.14.0","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.16.2","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.18.2","v0.19.0","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.10.3","v1.10.4","v1.11.0","v1.11.1","v1.11.2","v1.11.3","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.12.2","v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.14.0","v1.14.1","v1.15.0","v1.15.1","v1.16.0","v1.16.1","v1.16.2","v1.16.3","v1.16.4","v1.16.5","v1.16.6","v1.17.0","v1.17.1","v1.17.2","v1.17.3","v1.17.4","v1.17.5","v1.18.0","v1.18.1","v1.18.2","v1.18.3","v1.19.0","v1.19.1","v1.19.2","v1.19.3","v1.19.4","v1.2.0","v1.20.0","v1.20.1","v1.20.2","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.8.3","v1.8.4","v1.8.5","v1.8.6","v1.8.7","v1.8.8","v1.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24845.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24845.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/chainguard-dev/malcontent/commit/538ed00cdc639d687a4bd1e843a2be0428a3b3e7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/chainguard-dev/malcontent/security/advisories/GHSA-9m43-p3cx-w8j5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24845"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-522"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24845.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
