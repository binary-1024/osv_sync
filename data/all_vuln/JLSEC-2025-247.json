This flaw involves an 'off-by-one' miscalculation when handling prefixes and suffixes for file names. This can lead to a 1-byte write overflow. While seemingly small, such an overflow can corrupt adjacent memory, leading to unpredictable program behavior, crashes, or in specific circumstances, could be leveraged as a building block for more sophisticated exploitation.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"LibArchive_jll","ecosystem":"Julia","purl":"pkg:julia/LibArchive_jll?uuid=1e303b3e-d4db-56ce-88c4-91e52606a1a8"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.8.0+0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/SecurityAdvisories.jl/tree/generated/osv/2025/JLSEC-2025-247.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-5917"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2370874"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/pull/2588"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/releases/tag/v3.8.0"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC-BY-4.0","sources":[{"html_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-5917","id":"CVE-2025-5917","imported":"2025-11-25T21:58:26.895Z","modified":"2025-08-15T18:16:42.910Z","published":"2025-06-09T20:15:27.330Z","url":"https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2025-5917"}]}}
