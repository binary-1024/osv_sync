The function mbedtls_x509_string_to_names() takes a head argument that is documented as an output argument. The documentation does not suggest that the function will free that pointer; however, the function does call mbedtls_asn1_free_named_data_list() on that argument, which performs a deep free(). As a result, application code that uses this function (relying only on documented behavior) is likely to still hold pointers to the memory blocks that were freed, resulting in a high risk of use-after-free or double-free. In particular, the two sample programs x509/cert_write and x509/cert_req are affected (use-after-free if the san string contains more than one DN).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"MbedTLS_jll","ecosystem":"Julia","purl":"pkg:julia/MbedTLS_jll?uuid=c8ffd9c3-330d-5841-b78e-0817d7145fa1"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.28.1010+0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/SecurityAdvisories.jl/tree/generated/osv/2025/JLSEC-2025-231.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls-docs/blob/main/security-advisories/mbedtls-security-advisory-2025-06-7.md"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://mbed-tls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tech-updates/security-advisories/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/08/msg00013.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/08/msg00025.html"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC-BY-4.0","sources":[{"html_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47917","id":"CVE-2025-47917","imported":"2025-11-20T23:04:03.217Z","modified":"2025-11-03T20:19:05.870Z","published":"2025-07-20T19:15:23.847Z","url":"https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2025-47917"}]}}
