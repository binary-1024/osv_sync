{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-1753","published":"2024-03-18T15:15:41Z","modified":"2025-10-14T04:26:26.209108Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-1753"],"details":"A flaw was found in Buildah (and subsequently Podman Build) which allows containers to mount arbitrary locations on the host filesystem into build containers. A malicious Containerfile can use a dummy image with a symbolic link to the root filesystem as a mount source and cause the mount operation to mount the host root filesystem inside the RUN step. The commands inside the RUN step will then have read-write access to the host filesystem, allowing for full container escape at build time.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"golang-github-containers-buildah","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-containers-buildah?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.19.6+dfsg1-1","1.20.0+ds1-1","1.20.1+ds1-1","1.20.1+ds1-2","1.21.0+ds1-2","1.21.3+ds1-1","1.22.3+ds1-1","1.22.3+ds1-2","1.23.1+ds1-1","1.23.1+ds1-2","1.23.1+ds1-3","1.24.1+ds1-1","1.26.1+ds1-1","1.27.0+ds1-2","1.27.0+ds1-3","1.27.0+ds1-4","1.27.0+ds1-5","1.27.0+ds1-6","1.28.0+ds1-1","1.28.0+ds1-2","1.28.0+ds1-3","1.28.2+ds1-1","1.28.2+ds1-2","1.28.2+ds1-3","1.29.0+ds1-1","1.30.0+ds1-1","1.30.0+ds1-2","1.30.0+ds1-3","1.31.2+ds1-1","1.31.2+ds1-2","1.31.2+ds1-3","1.32.0+ds1-1","1.32.0+ds1-2","1.32.2+ds1-1","1.33.1+ds1-1","1.33.1+ds1-2","1.33.3+ds1-1","1.33.3+ds1-2","1.33.5+ds1-3","1.33.5+ds1-4","1.33.7+ds1-1","1.34.0+ds1-1","1.34.0+ds1-2","1.35.3+ds1-1","1.35.3+ds1-2","1.35.3+ds1-3","1.37.0+ds1-1","1.37.1+ds1-1","1.37.1+ds1-2","1.37.2+ds1-1","1.37.2+ds1-2","1.37.2+ds1-3","1.37.3+ds1-1","1.37.3+ds1-2","1.37.3+ds1-3","1.37.4+ds1-1","1.37.5+ds1-1","1.38.0+ds1-1","1.38.0+ds1-2","1.38.1+ds1-1","1.39.0+ds1-1","1.39.3+ds1-1","1.41.4+ds1-1","1.41.4+ds1-2","1.41.4+ds1-3","1.41.5+ds1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-1753.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-containers-buildah","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-containers-buildah?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.28.2+ds1-3","1.28.2+ds1-3+deb12u1","1.29.0+ds1-1","1.30.0+ds1-1","1.30.0+ds1-2","1.30.0+ds1-3","1.31.2+ds1-1","1.31.2+ds1-2","1.31.2+ds1-3","1.32.0+ds1-1","1.32.0+ds1-2","1.32.2+ds1-1","1.33.1+ds1-1","1.33.1+ds1-2","1.33.3+ds1-1","1.33.3+ds1-2","1.33.5+ds1-3","1.33.5+ds1-4","1.33.7+ds1-1","1.34.0+ds1-1","1.34.0+ds1-2","1.35.3+ds1-1","1.35.3+ds1-2","1.35.3+ds1-3","1.37.0+ds1-1","1.37.1+ds1-1","1.37.1+ds1-2","1.37.2+ds1-1","1.37.2+ds1-2","1.37.2+ds1-3","1.37.3+ds1-1","1.37.3+ds1-2","1.37.3+ds1-3","1.37.4+ds1-1","1.37.5+ds1-1","1.38.0+ds1-1","1.38.0+ds1-2","1.38.1+ds1-1","1.39.0+ds1-1","1.39.3+ds1-1","1.41.4+ds1-1","1.41.4+ds1-2","1.41.4+ds1-3","1.41.5+ds1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-1753.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-containers-buildah","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-containers-buildah?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.33.7+ds1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-1753.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-containers-buildah","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-containers-buildah?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.33.7+ds1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-1753.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-1753"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
