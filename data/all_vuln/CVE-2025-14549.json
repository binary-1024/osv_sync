{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-14549","published":"2025-12-15T06:15:42.733Z","modified":"2026-01-22T05:51:19.981158Z","details":"In the Eclipse OMR compiler component, since release 0.7.0, an optimization enabled for Eclipse OpenJ9 consumers of OMR on Z processors incorrectly handles NUL (0x00) characters during the Latin-compatible charset (UTF-8, ISO8859-1, ASCII, etc) to IBM-1047/037 translation sequence. This can cause the output byte array to be truncated, discarding the first NUL byte and all subsequent characters, and thereby exposing a possible buffer over-read problem. This issue is fixed in Eclipse OMR version 0.8.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/eclipse-omr/omr","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"01268e034df7dd66418b7f2dc4b1d861e9aa91b0"}]}],"versions":["omr-0.1.0","omr-0.2.0","omr-0.3.0","omr-0.4.0","omr-0.5.0","omr-0.6.0","omr-0.7.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-14549.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/eclipse-omr/omr/pull/8073"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"}]}
