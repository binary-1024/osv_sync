GLib&apos;s code was separated from GTK, so it can be used by software other than GNOME and has been developed in parallel ever since.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.66.7 and 2.67.x before 2.67.4. If g_byte_array_new_take() was called with a buffer of 4GB or more on a 64-bit platform, the length would be truncated modulo 2**32, causing unintended length truncation.(CVE-2021-27218)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.66.6 and 2.67.x before 2.67.3. The function g_bytes_new has an integer overflow on 64-bit platforms due to an implicit cast from 64 bits to 32 bits. The overflow could potentially lead to memory corruption.(CVE-2021-27219)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"glib2","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/glib2&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.62.5-6.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["glib2-2.62.5-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm","glib2-debuginfo-2.62.5-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm","glib2-debugsource-2.62.5-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm","glib2-devel-2.62.5-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["glib2-help-2.62.5-6.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["glib2-2.62.5-6.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["glib2-devel-2.62.5-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm","glib2-debuginfo-2.62.5-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm","glib2-2.62.5-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm","glib2-debugsource-2.62.5-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1107.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1107"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27218"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27219"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
