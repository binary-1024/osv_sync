  "details": "GLib is a bundle of three (formerly five) low-level system libraries written in C and developed mainly by GNOME. GLib&apos;s code was separated from GTK, so it can be used by software other than GNOME and has been developed in parallel ever since.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.66.7 and 2.67.x before 2.67.4. If g_byte_array_new_take() was called with a buffer of 4GB or more on a 64-bit platform, the length would be truncated modulo 2**32, causing unintended length truncation.(CVE-2021-27218)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.66.6 and 2.67.x before 2.67.3. The function g_bytes_new has an integer overflow on 64-bit platforms due to an implicit cast from 64 bits to 32 bits. The overflow could potentially lead to memory corruption.(CVE-2021-27219)",
