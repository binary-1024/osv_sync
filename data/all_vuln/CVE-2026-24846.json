Starting in version 1.8.0 and prior to version 1.20.3, malcontent could be made to create symlinks outside the intended extraction directory when scanning a specially crafted tar or deb archive. The `handleSymlink` function received arguments in the wrong order, causing the symlink target to be used as the symlink location. Additionally, symlink targets were not validated to ensure they resolved within the extraction directory. Version 1.20.3 introduces fixes that swap handleSymlink arguments, validate symlink location, and validate symlink targets that resolve within an extraction directory.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/chainguard-dev/malcontent","events":[{"introduced":"a7e559c2e2c12e80dc4a308a96d2985f2853ceaa"},{"fixed":"96faed538d6fdd5fc27e4a9b9ecff5385325ce54"}]}],"versions":["v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.10.3","v1.10.4","v1.11.0","v1.11.1","v1.11.2","v1.11.3","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.12.2","v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.14.0","v1.14.1","v1.15.0","v1.15.1","v1.16.0","v1.16.1","v1.16.2","v1.16.3","v1.16.4","v1.16.5","v1.16.6","v1.17.0","v1.17.1","v1.17.2","v1.17.3","v1.17.4","v1.17.5","v1.18.0","v1.18.1","v1.18.2","v1.18.3","v1.19.0","v1.19.1","v1.19.2","v1.19.3","v1.19.4","v1.20.0","v1.20.1","v1.20.2","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.8.3","v1.8.4","v1.8.5","v1.8.6","v1.8.7","v1.8.8","v1.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24846.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24846.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/chainguard-dev/malcontent/commit/259fca5abc004f3ab238895463ef280a87f30e96"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/chainguard-dev/malcontent/commit/a7dd8a5328ddbaf235568437813efa7591e00017"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/chainguard-dev/malcontent/security/advisories/GHSA-923j-vrcg-hxwh"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24846"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-22","CWE-683"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24846.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
