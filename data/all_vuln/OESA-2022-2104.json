This package provides the essential shared library for any PostgreSQL client program or interface.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in PostgreSQL. There is an issue with incomplete efforts to operate safely when a privileged user is maintaining another user&apos;s objects. The Autovacuum, REINDEX, CREATE INDEX, REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW, CLUSTER, and pg_amcheck commands activated relevant protections too late or not at all during the process. This flaw allows an attacker with permission to create non-temporary objects in at least one schema to execute arbitrary SQL functions under a superuser identity.(CVE-2022-1552)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libpq","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/libpq&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"13.7-1.oe2203"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libpq-debuginfo-13.7-1.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","libpq-debugsource-13.7-1.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","libpq-devel-13.7-1.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","libpq-13.7-1.oe2203.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["libpq-13.7-1.oe2203.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libpq-13.7-1.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","libpq-devel-13.7-1.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","libpq-debuginfo-13.7-1.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","libpq-debugsource-13.7-1.oe2203.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-2104.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2022-2104"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1552"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
