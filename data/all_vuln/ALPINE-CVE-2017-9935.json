{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2017-9935","published":"2017-06-26T12:29:00.187Z","modified":"2025-11-19T06:11:54.322956Z","upstream":["CVE-2017-9935"],"details":"In LibTIFF 4.0.8, there is a heap-based buffer overflow in the t2p_write_pdf function in tools/tiff2pdf.c. This heap overflow could lead to different damages. For example, a crafted TIFF document can lead to an out-of-bounds read in TIFFCleanup, an invalid free in TIFFClose or t2p_free, memory corruption in t2p_readwrite_pdf_image, or a double free in t2p_free. Given these possibilities, it probably could cause arbitrary code execution.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"tiff","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tiff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.9-r6"}]}],"versions":["3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.9.5-r0","3.9.5-r1","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.0.3-r2","4.0.3-r3","4.0.6-r0","4.0.6-r1","4.0.6-r2","4.0.6-r3","4.0.7-r0","4.0.7-r1","4.0.7-r2","4.0.7-r3","4.0.8-r0","4.0.8-r1","4.0.9-r0","4.0.9-r1","4.0.9-r2","4.0.9-r3","4.0.9-r4","4.0.9-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-9935.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tiff","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tiff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.9-r6"}]}],"versions":["3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.9.5-r0","3.9.5-r1","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.0.3-r2","4.0.3-r3","4.0.6-r0","4.0.6-r1","4.0.6-r2","4.0.6-r3","4.0.7-r0","4.0.7-r1","4.0.7-r2","4.0.7-r3","4.0.8-r0","4.0.8-r1","4.0.9-r0","4.0.9-r1","4.0.9-r2","4.0.9-r3","4.0.9-r4","4.0.9-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-9935.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tiff","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tiff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.9-r6"}]}],"versions":["3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.9.5-r0","3.9.5-r1","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.0.3-r2","4.0.3-r3","4.0.6-r0","4.0.6-r1","4.0.6-r2","4.0.6-r3","4.0.7-r0","4.0.7-r1","4.0.7-r2","4.0.7-r3","4.0.8-r0","4.0.8-r1","4.0.9-r0","4.0.9-r1","4.0.9-r2","4.0.9-r3","4.0.9-r4","4.0.9-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-9935.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tiff","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tiff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.9-r6"}]}],"versions":["3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.9.5-r0","3.9.5-r1","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.0.3-r2","4.0.3-r3","4.0.6-r0","4.0.6-r1","4.0.6-r2","4.0.6-r3","4.0.7-r0","4.0.7-r1","4.0.7-r2","4.0.7-r3","4.0.8-r0","4.0.8-r1","4.0.9-r0","4.0.9-r1","4.0.9-r2","4.0.9-r3","4.0.9-r4","4.0.9-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-9935.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tiff","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tiff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.9-r6"}]}],"versions":["3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.9.5-r0","3.9.5-r1","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.0.3-r2","4.0.3-r3","4.0.6-r0","4.0.6-r1","4.0.6-r2","4.0.6-r3","4.0.7-r0","4.0.7-r1","4.0.7-r2","4.0.7-r3","4.0.8-r0","4.0.8-r1","4.0.9-r0","4.0.9-r1","4.0.9-r2","4.0.9-r3","4.0.9-r4","4.0.9-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-9935.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tiff","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tiff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.9-r6"}]}],"versions":["3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.9.5-r0","3.9.5-r1","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.0.3-r2","4.0.3-r3","4.0.6-r0","4.0.6-r1","4.0.6-r2","4.0.6-r3","4.0.7-r0","4.0.7-r1","4.0.7-r2","4.0.7-r3","4.0.8-r0","4.0.8-r1","4.0.9-r0","4.0.9-r1","4.0.9-r2","4.0.9-r3","4.0.9-r4","4.0.9-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-9935.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tiff","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tiff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.9-r6"}]}],"versions":["3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.9.5-r0","3.9.5-r1","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.0.3-r2","4.0.3-r3","4.0.6-r0","4.0.6-r1","4.0.6-r2","4.0.6-r3","4.0.7-r0","4.0.7-r1","4.0.7-r2","4.0.7-r3","4.0.8-r0","4.0.8-r1","4.0.9-r0","4.0.9-r1","4.0.9-r2","4.0.9-r3","4.0.9-r4","4.0.9-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-9935.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tiff","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tiff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.9-r6"}]}],"versions":["3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.9.5-r0","3.9.5-r1","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.0.3-r2","4.0.3-r3","4.0.6-r0","4.0.6-r1","4.0.6-r2","4.0.6-r3","4.0.7-r0","4.0.7-r1","4.0.7-r2","4.0.7-r3","4.0.8-r0","4.0.8-r1","4.0.9-r0","4.0.9-r1","4.0.9-r2","4.0.9-r3","4.0.9-r4","
