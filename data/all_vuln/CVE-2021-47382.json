An error path was missed though, that still takes\ndiscipline_mutex and thus has the original deadlock potential.\n\nIntermittent deadlocks were seen when a qeth channel path is configured\noffline, causing a race between qeth_do_reset and ccwgroup_remove.\nCall qeth_set_offline() directly in the qeth_do_reset() error case and\nthen a new variant of ccwgroup_set_offline(), without taking\ndiscipline_mutex.","references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0bfe741741327822d1482c7edef0184636d08b40"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d2b59bd4b06d84a4eadb520b0f71c62fe8ec0a62"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
