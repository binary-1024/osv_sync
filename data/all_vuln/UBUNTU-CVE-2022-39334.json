{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"UBUNTU-CVE-2022-39334","published":"2022-11-25T19:15:00Z","modified":"2026-01-20T17:30:48.020595Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-39334"],"details":"Nextcloud also ships a CLI utility called nextcloudcmd which is sometimes used for automated scripting and headless servers. Versions of nextcloudcmd prior to 3.6.1 would incorrectly trust invalid TLS certificates, which may enable a Man-in-the-middle attack that exposes sensitive data or credentials to a network attacker. This affects the CLI only. It does not affect the standard GUI desktop Nextcloud clients, and it does not affect the Nextcloud server.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nextcloud-desktop","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:20.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/nextcloud-desktop@2.6.2-1build1?arch=source&distro=focal"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.5.3-1","2.6.0-1","2.6.1-1","2.6.1-2","2.6.2-1","2.6.2-1build1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"caja-nextcloud","binary_version":"2.6.2-1build1"},{"binary_name":"dolphin-nextcloud","binary_version":"2.6.2-1build1"},{"binary_name":"libnextcloudsync-dev","binary_version":"2.6.2-1build1"},{"binary_name":"libnextcloudsync0","binary_version":"2.6.2-1build1"},{"binary_name":"nautilus-nextcloud","binary_version":"2.6.2-1build1"},{"binary_name":"nemo-nextcloud","binary_version":"2.6.2-1build1"},{"binary_name":"nextcloud-desktop","binary_version":"2.6.2-1build1"},{"binary_name":"nextcloud-desktop-cmd","binary_version":"2.6.2-1build1"},{"binary_name":"nextcloud-desktop-common","binary_version":"2.6.2-1build1"},{"binary_name":"nextcloud-desktop-l10n","binary_version":"2.6.2-1build1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2022/UBUNTU-CVE-2022-39334.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nextcloud-desktop","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:22.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/nextcloud-desktop@3.4.2-1ubuntu1?arch=source&distro=jammy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.2.3-0ubuntu1","3.3.5-1","3.3.5-1ubuntu1","3.4.2-1","3.4.2-1ubuntu1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"caja-nextcloud","binary_version":"3.4.2-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"dolphin-nextcloud","binary_version":"3.4.2-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"libnextcloudsync-dev","binary_version":"3.4.2-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"libnextcloudsync0","binary_version":"3.4.2-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"nautilus-nextcloud","binary_version":"3.4.2-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"nemo-nextcloud","binary_version":"3.4.2-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"nextcloud-desktop","binary_version":"3.4.2-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"nextcloud-desktop-cmd","binary_version":"3.4.2-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"nextcloud-desktop-common","binary_version":"3.4.2-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"nextcloud-desktop-l10n","binary_version":"3.4.2-1ubuntu1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2022/UBUNTU-CVE-2022-39334.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nextcloud-desktop","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/nextcloud-desktop@3.11.0-1.1build4?arch=source&distro=noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.9.0-1","3.10.0-1","3.11.0-1","3.11.0-1.1build3","3.11.0-1.1build4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"caja-nextcloud","binary_version":"3.11.0-1.1build4"},{"binary_name":"dolphin-nextcloud","binary_version":"3.11.0-1.1build4"},{"binary_name":"libnextcloudsync-dev","binary_version":"3.11.0-1.1build4"},{"binary_name":"libnextcloudsync0t64","binary_version":"3.11.0-1.1build4"},{"binary_name":"nautilus-nextcloud","binary_version":"3.11.0-1.1build4"},{"binary_name":"nemo-nextcloud","binary_version":"3.11.0-1.1build4"},{"binary_name":"nextcloud-desktop","binary_version":"3.11.0-1.1build4"},{"binary_name":"nextcloud-desktop-cmd","binary_version":"3.11.0-1.1build4"},{"binary_name":"nextcloud-desktop-common","binary_version":"3.11.0-1.1build4"},{"binary_name":"nextcloud-desktop-l10n","binary_version":"3.11.0-1.1build4"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2022/UBUNTU-CVE-2022-39334.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nextcloud-desktop","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.10","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/nextcloud-desktop@3.16.6-3?arch=source&distro=questing"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.16.0-1","3.16.2-1","3.16.4-1","3.16.6-1","3.16.6-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"caja-nextcloud","binary_version":"3.16.6-3"},{"binary_name":"dolphin-nextcloud","binary_version":"3.16.6-3"},{"binary_name":"libnextcloudsync-dev","binary_version":"3.16.6-3"},{"binary_name":"libnextcloudsync0t64","binary_version":"3.16.6-3"},{"binary_name":"nautilus-nextcloud","binary_version":"3.16.6-3"},{"binary_name":"nemo-nextcloud","binary_version":"3.16.6-3"},{"binary_name":"nextcloud-desktop","binary_version":"3.16.6-3"},{"binary_name":"nextcloud-desktop-cmd","binary_version":"3.16.6-3"},{"binary_name":"nextcloud-desktop-common","binary_version":"3.16.6-3"},{"binary_name":"nextcloud-desktop-l10n","binary_version":"3.16.6-3"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2022/UBUNTU-CVE-2022-39334.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-39334"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/1699740"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-82xx-98xv-4jxv"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/n
