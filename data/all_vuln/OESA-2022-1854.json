  "details": "This is Varnish Cache, a web application accelerator also known as a caching HTTP reverse proxy. You install it in front of any server that speaks HTTP and configure it to cache the contents. Varnish Cache is really, really fast. It typically speeds up delivery with a factor of 300 - 1000x, depending on your architecture.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nIn Varnish Cache 7.0.0, 7.0.1, 7.0.2, and 7.1.0, it is possible to cause the Varnish Server to assert and automatically restart through forged HTTP/1 backend responses. An attack uses a crafted reason phrase of the backend response status line. This is fixed in 7.0.3 and 7.1.1.(CVE-2022-38150)",
