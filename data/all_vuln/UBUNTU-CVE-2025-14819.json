Contrary to the user's wishes and expectations. This could make libcurl find and accept a trust chain that it otherwise would not.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:22.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/curl@7.81.0-1ubuntu1.21?arch=source&distro=jammy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["7.74.0-1.3ubuntu2","7.74.0-1.3ubuntu3","7.80.0-3","7.81.0-1","7.81.0-1ubuntu1.1","7.81.0-1ubuntu1.2","7.81.0-1ubuntu1.3","7.81.0-1ubuntu1.4","7.81.0-1ubuntu1.6","7.81.0-1ubuntu1.7","7.81.0-1ubuntu1.8","7.81.0-1ubuntu1.10","7.81.0-1ubuntu1.11","7.81.0-1ubuntu1.13","7.81.0-1ubuntu1.14","7.81.0-1ubuntu1.15","7.81.0-1ubuntu1.16","7.81.0-1ubuntu1.17","7.81.0-1ubuntu1.18","7.81.0-1ubuntu1.19","7.81.0-1ubuntu1.20","7.81.0-1ubuntu1.21"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"curl","binary_version":"7.81.0-1ubuntu1.21"},{"binary_name":"libcurl3-gnutls","binary_version":"7.81.0-1ubuntu1.21"},{"binary_name":"libcurl3-nss","binary_version":"7.81.0-1ubuntu1.21"},{"binary_name":"libcurl4","binary_version":"7.81.0-1ubuntu1.21"},{"binary_name":"libcurl4-gnutls-dev","binary_version":"7.81.0-1ubuntu1.21"},{"binary_name":"libcurl4-nss-dev","binary_version":"7.81.0-1ubuntu1.21"},{"binary_name":"libcurl4-openssl-dev","binary_version":"7.81.0-1ubuntu1.21"}],"priority_reason":"This is rated as being low severity by Curl developers"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-14819.json"}},{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/curl@8.5.0-2ubuntu10.6?arch=source&distro=noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["8.2.1-1ubuntu3","8.2.1-1ubuntu3.1","8.4.0-2ubuntu1","8.5.0-2ubuntu1","8.5.0-2ubuntu2","8.5.0-2ubuntu8","8.5.0-2ubuntu9","8.5.0-2ubuntu10","8.5.0-2ubuntu10.1","8.5.0-2ubuntu10.2","8.5.0-2ubuntu10.3","8.5.0-2ubuntu10.4","8.5.0-2ubuntu10.5","8.5.0-2ubuntu10.6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"curl","binary_version":"8.5.0-2ubuntu10.6"},{"binary_name":"libcurl3t64-gnutls","binary_version":"8.5.0-2ubuntu10.6"},{"binary_name":"libcurl4-gnutls-dev","binary_version":"8.5.0-2ubuntu10.6"},{"binary_name":"libcurl4-openssl-dev","binary_version":"8.5.0-2ubuntu10.6"},{"binary_name":"libcurl4t64","binary_version":"8.5.0-2ubuntu10.6"}],"priority_reason":"This is rated as being low severity by Curl developers"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-14819.json"}},{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.10","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/curl@8.14.1-2ubuntu1?arch=source&distro=questing"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["8.12.1-3ubuntu1","8.13.0-5ubuntu1","8.14.1-1ubuntu2","8.14.1-1ubuntu3","8.14.1-2ubuntu1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"curl","binary_version":"8.14.1-2ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"libcurl3t64-gnutls","binary_version":"8.14.1-2ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"libcurl4-gnutls-dev","binary_version":"8.14.1-2ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"libcurl4-openssl-dev","binary_version":"8.14.1-2ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"libcurl4t64","binary_version":"8.14.1-2ubuntu1"}],"priority_reason":"This is rated as being low severity by Curl developers"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-14819.json"}},{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.04","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/curl@8.12.1-3ubuntu1?arch=source&distro=plucky"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["8.9.1-2ubuntu2","8.9.1-2ubuntu3","8.11.0-1ubuntu2","8.11.1-1ubuntu1","8.12.0+git20250209.89ed161+ds-1ubuntu1","8.12.1-2ubuntu1","8.12.1-3ubuntu1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"curl","binary_version":"8.12.1-3ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"libcurl3t64-gnutls","binary_version":"8.12.1-3ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"libcurl4-gnutls-dev","binary_version":"8.12.1-3ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"libcurl4-openssl-dev","binary_version":"8.12.1-3ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"libcurl4t64","binary_version":"8.12.1-3ubuntu1"}],"priority_reason":"This is rated as being low severity by Curl developers"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-14819.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-14819"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14819"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2025-14819.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"low"}]}
