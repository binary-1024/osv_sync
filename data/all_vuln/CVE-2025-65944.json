From version 10.11.0 to before 10.27.0, when a Node.js application using the Sentry SDK has sendDefaultPii: true it is possible to inadvertently send certain sensitive HTTP headers, including the Cookie header, to Sentry. Those headers would be stored within a Sentry organization as part of the associated trace. A person with access to the Sentry organization could then view and use these sensitive values to impersonate or escalate their privileges within the application. This issue has been patched in version 10.27.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a820fa2891fdcf985b834a5b557edf351ec54539"},{"fixed":"d756d0520b6651f153644c9e917c59c8735ddf7f"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.1.1","0.1.2","0.1.3","0.1.4","0.2","0.2.1","0.3","0.4","0.5","0.5.1","0.5.2","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.1.0","1.1.0-rc1","1.1.0-rc2","1.1.0-rc3","1.1.0-rc4","1.1.1","1.1.10","1.1.11","1.1.12","1.1.13","1.1.14","1.1.15","1.1.16","1.1.17","1.1.18","1.1.19","1.1.2","1.1.20","1.1.21","1.1.22","1.1.3","1.1.4","1.1.5","1.1.6","1.1.7","1.1.8","1.1.9","1.2.0","1.3.0","10.0.0","10.1.0","10.10.0","10.2.0","10.3.0","10.4.0","10.5.0","10.6.0","10.7.0","10.8.0","10.9.0","2.0.0","2.0.0-rc1","2.0.0-rc2","2.1.0","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.3.0","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.4.2","2.5.0","2.6.0","2.6.1","2.6.2","3.0.0","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.0.5","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.10.0","3.11.0","3.12.0","3.12.1","3.13.0","3.13.1","3.14.0","3.14.1","3.14.2","3.16.0","3.16.1","3.17.0","3.18.0","3.18.1","3.19.0","3.19.1","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.20.0","3.20.1","3.21.0","3.22.0","3.22.1","3.22.2","3.22.3","3.22.4","3.23.0","3.23.1","3.23.2","3.23.3","3.24.0","3.24.1","3.24.2","3.25.0","3.25.1","3.25.2","3.26.0","3.26.1","3.26.2","3.3.0","3.4.0","3.4.1","3.5.0","3.5.1","3.6.0","3.6.1","3.7.0","3.8.0","3.9.0","3.9.1","3.9.2","4.0.0","4.0.1","4.0.2","4.0.3","4.0.4","4.0.5","4.0.6","4.1.0","4.1.1","4.2.0","4.2.1","4.2.2","4.2.3","4.2.4","4.3.0","4.3.1","4.3.2","4.3.3","4.3.4","4.4.0","4.4.1","4.4.2","4.5.0","4.5.1","4.5.2","4.5.3","4.5.4","4.6.0","4.6.1","4.6.2","4.6.3","4.6.4","5.0.0","5.0.0-beta.2","5.0.0-beta1","5.0.0-rc.0","5.0.0-rc.1","5.0.0-rc.2","5.0.0-rc.3","5.0.1","5.0.2","5.0.3","5.0.4","5.0.5","5.0.6","5.0.7","5.0.8","5.1.0","5.1.1","5.1.2","5.1.3","5.10.0","5.10.1","5.10.2","5.11.0","5.11.1","5.11.2","5.12.0","5.12.1","5.12.2","5.12.3","5.12.4","5.12.5","5.13.0","5.13.1","5.13.2","5.14.0","5.14.1","5.14.2","5.15.0","5.15.1","5.15.2","5.15.3","5.15.4","5.15.5","5.16.0","5.16.0-beta.1","5.16.0-beta.2","5.16.0-beta.3","5.16.0-beta.4","5.16.0-beta.5","5.16.1","5.17.0","5.18.0","5.18.1","5.19.0","5.19.1","5.19.2","5.2.0","5.2.1","5.20.0","5.20.1","5.21.0","5.21.1","5.21.2","5.21.3","5.21.4","5.22.0","5.22.1","5.22.2","5.22.3","5.23.0","5.24.0","5.24.1","5.24.2","5.25.0","5.26.0","5.27.0","5.27.1","5.27.2","5.27.3","5.27.4","5.27.5","5.27.6","5.28.0","5.29.0","5.29.1","5.29.2","5.3.0","5.3.1","5.30.0","5.4.0","5.4.1","5.4.2","5.4.3","5.5.0","5.6.0","5.6.1","5.6.2","5.6.3","5.7.0","5.7.0-beta.0","5.7.1","5.8.0","5.9.0","5.9.1","6.0.0","6.0.1","6.0.2","6.0.3","6.0.4","6.1.0","6.10.0","6.11.0","6.12.0","6.13.0","6.13.1","6.13.2","6.13.3","6.14.0","6.14.1","6.14.2","6.14.3","6.15.0","6.16.0","6.16.1","6.17.0","6.17.0-beta.0","6.17.1","6.17.2","6.17.4","6.17.5","6.17.6","6.17.7","6.17.8","6.17.9","6.18.0","6.18.1","6.18.1-beta.0","6.18.2","6.19.0","6.19.1","6.19.2","6.19.3","6.19.4","6.19.5","6.19.6","6.19.7","6.2.0","6.2.1","6.2.2","6.2.3","6.2.4","6.2.5","6.3.0","6.3.1","6.3.2","6.3.3","6.3.4","6.3.5","6.3.6","6.4.0","6.4.1","6.5.0","6.5.1","6.6.0","6.7.0","6.7.1","6.7.2","6.8.0","6.9.0","7.0.0","7.1.0","7.1.1","7.100.0","7.11.0","7.11.1","7.12.0","7.12.1","7.13.0","7.14.0","7.14.1","7.14.2","7.15.0","7.16.0","7.17.1","7.17.2","7.17.3","7.17.4","7.18.0","7.19.0","7.2.0","7.20.0","7.20.1","7.21.0","7.21.1","7.22.0","7.23.0","7.24.0","7.24.1","7.24.2","7.25.0","7.26.0","7.27.0","7.28.0","7.28.1","7.29.0","7.3.0","7.3.1","7.30.0","7.31.0","7.31.1","7.32.0","7.32.1","7.33.0","7.34.0","7.35.0","7.36.0","7.37.0","7.37.1","7.37.2","7.38.0","7.39.0","7.4.1","7.40.0","7.41.0","7.42.0","7.43.0","7.44.0","7.44.1","7.44.2","7.45.0","7.46.0","7.47.0","7.48.0","7.49.0","7.5.0","7.5.1","7.50.0","7.51.0","7.51.1","7.51.2","7.52.0","7.52.1","7.53.0","7.53.1","7.54.0","7.55.0","7.55.1","7.55.2","7.56.0","7.57.0","7.58.0","7.58.1","7.59.2","7.59.3","7.6.0","7.60.0","7.60.1","7.61.0","7.61.1","7.62.0","7.63.0","7.64.0","7.65.0","7.66.0","7.67.0","7.68.0","7.69.0","7.7.0","7.70.0","7.71.0","7.72.0","7.73.0","7.74.0","7.74.1","7.75.0","7.75.1","7.76.0","7.77.0","7.78.0","7.79.0","7.8.0","7.8.1","7.80.0","7.80.1","7.81.0","7.81.1","7.82.0","7.83.0","7.84.0","7.85.0","7.86.0","7.87.0","7.88.0","7.89.0","7.9.0","7.90.0","7.91.0","7.92.0","7.93.0","7.94.1","7.95.0","7.97.0","7.98.0","7.99.0","8.0.0","8.0.0-alpha.2","8.0.0-alpha.5","8.0.0-alpha.7","8.0.0-alpha.9","8.0.0-beta.1","8.0.0-beta.2","8.0.0-beta.3","8.0.0-beta.4","8.0.0-beta.5","8.0.0-beta.6","8.0.0-rc.1","8.0.0-rc.2","8.0.0-rc.3","8.1.0","8.10.0","8.11.0","8.12.0","8.13.0","8.14.0","8.15.0","8.16.0","8.17.0","8.18.0","8.19.0","8.2.0","8.2.1","8.20.0","8.21.0","8.22.0","8.23.0","8.24.0","8.25.0","8.26.0","8.27.0","8.28.0","8.29.0","8.3.0","8.30.0","8.31.0","8.32.0","8.33.0","8.33.1","8.34.0","8.35.0","8.36.0","8.37.0","8.37.1","8.38.0","8.39.0","8.4.0","8.40.0","8.41.0","8.42.0","8.43.0","8.44.0","8.45.0","8.5.0","8.7.0","8.8.0","8.9.
