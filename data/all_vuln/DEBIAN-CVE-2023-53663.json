Userspace can trigger the WARN at will by writing the MSR and then updating guest CPUID to hide the feature (modifying guest CPUID is allowed anytime before KVM_RUN).  E.g. hacking KVM's state_test selftest to do  \t\tvcpu_set_msr(vcpu, MSR_AMD64_TSC_RATIO, 0); \t\tvcpu_clear_cpuid_feature(vcpu, X86_FEATURE_TSCRATEMSR);  after restoring state in a new VM+vCPU yields an endless supply of:    ------------[ cut here ]------------   WARNING: CPU: 164 PID: 62565 at arch/x86/kvm/svm/nested.c:699            nested_vmcb02_prepare_control+0x3d6/0x3f0 [kvm_amd]   Call Trace:    <TASK>    enter_svm_guest_mode+0x114/0x560 [kvm_amd]    nested_svm_vmrun+0x260/0x330 [kvm_amd]    vmrun_interception+0x29/0x30 [kvm_amd]    svm_invoke_exit_handler+0x35/0x100 [kvm_amd]    svm_handle_exit+0xe7/0x180 [kvm_amd]    kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x1eab/0x2570 [kvm]    kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x4c9/0x5b0 [kvm]    __se_sys_ioctl+0x7a/0xc0    __x64_sys_ioctl+0x21/0x30    do_syscall_64+0x41/0x90    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd   RIP: 0033:0x45ca1b  Note, the nested #VMEXIT path has the same flaw, but needs a different fix and will be handled separately.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.55-1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.27-1","6.1.37-1","6.1.38-1","6.1.38-2","6.1.38-2~bpo11+1","6.1.38-3","6.1.38-4","6.1.38-4~bpo11+1","6.1.52-1","6.1.55-1~bpo11+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53663.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.5.6-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53663.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.5.6-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53663.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-53663"}]}
