NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, stating \" The 'length' variable is only uninitialized if 'auth_type' is neither the 'KERBEROS_V4' nor 'GSSAPI'; this condition cannot occur in the unmodified source code.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://secunia.com/advisories/28636"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://secunia.com/advisories/29457"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.novell.com/linux/security/advisories/suse_security_summary_report.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199205"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://osvdb.org/44333"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Dec/0176.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Dec/0321.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://wiki.rpath.com/Advisories:rPSA-2008-0112"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Advisories:rPSA-2008-0112"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/489883/100/0/threaded"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/26750"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-2012"}],"database_specific":{"isDisputed":true}}
