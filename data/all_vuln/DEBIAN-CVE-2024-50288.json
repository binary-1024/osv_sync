  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: vivid: fix buffer overwrite when using > 32 buffers  The maximum number of buffers that can be requested was increased to 64 for the video capture queue. But video capture used a must_blank array that was still sized for 32 (VIDEO_MAX_FRAME). This caused an out-of-bounds write when using buffer indices >= 32.  Create a new define MAX_VID_CAP_BUFFERS that is used to access the must_blank array and set max_num_buffers for the video capture queue.  This solves a crash reported by:  \thttps://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=219258",
