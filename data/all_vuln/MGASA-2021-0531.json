  "summary": "Updated docker-containerd packages fix security vulnerability",
  "details": "The OCI Distribution Spec project defines an API protocol to facilitate\nand standardize the distribution of content. In the OCI Distribution\nSpecification version 1.0.0 and prior, the Content-Type header alone was\nused to determine the type of document during push and pull operations.\nDocuments that contain both \"manifests\" and \"layers\" fields could be\ninterpreted as either a manifest or an index in the absence of an\naccompanying Content-Type header. If a Content-Type header changed between\ntwo pulls of the same digest, a client may interpret the resulting content\ndifferently. The OCI Distribution Specification has been updated to require\nthat a mediaType value present in a manifest or index match the\nContent-Type header used during the push and pull operations. Clients\npulling from a registry may distrust the Content-Type header and reject an\nambiguous document that contains both \"manifests\" and \"layers\" fields or\n\"manifests\" and \"config\" fields if they are unable to update to version\n1.0.1 of the spec.\n",
