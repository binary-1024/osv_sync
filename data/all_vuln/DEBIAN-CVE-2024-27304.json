SQL injection can occur if an attacker can cause a single query or bind message to exceed 4 GB in size. An integer overflow in the calculated message size can cause the one large message to be sent as multiple messages under the attacker's control. The problem is resolved in v4.18.2 and v5.5.4. As a workaround, reject user input large enough to cause a single query or bind message to exceed 4 GB in size.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"golang-github-jackc-pgx","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-jackc-pgx?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.6.2-2","4.15.0-1","4.15.0-2","4.15.0-3","4.15.0-4","4.18.1-1","4.18.1-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-27304.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-jackc-pgx","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-jackc-pgx?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.15.0-4","4.18.1-1","4.18.1-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-27304.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-jackc-pgx","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-jackc-pgx?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.18.1-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-27304.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-jackc-pgx","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-jackc-pgx?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.18.1-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-27304.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-27304"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
