After the alternate mode discovery switch to polled mode the timeout was reduced, but instead of being set back to 5 seconds it was reduced to 1 second.  This is causing problems when using a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 yoga gen7 connected over Type-C to a LG 27UL850-W (charging DP over Type-C).  When the monitor is already connected at boot the following error is logged: \"PPM init failed (-110)\", /sys/class/typec is empty and on unplugging the NULL pointer deref fixed earlier in this series happens.  When the monitor is connected after boot the following error is logged instead: \"GET_CONNECTOR_STATUS failed (-110)\".  Setting the timeout back to 5 seconds fixes both cases.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.25-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53168.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.25-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53168.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.25-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53168.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-53168"}]}
