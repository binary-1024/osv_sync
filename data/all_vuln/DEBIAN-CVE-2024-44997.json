Previously, cb_priv was freed in mtk_wed_setup_tc_block() without marking NULL,and mtk_wed_setup_tc_block_cb() didn't check the value, too.  Assign NULL after free cb_priv in mtk_wed_setup_tc_block() and check NULL in mtk_wed_setup_tc_block_cb().  ---------- Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 0072460bca32b4f5 Call trace:  mtk_wed_setup_tc_block_cb+0x4/0x38  0xffffffc0794084bc  tcf_block_playback_offloads+0x70/0x1e8  tcf_block_unbind+0x6c/0xc8 ... ---------","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.10.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-44997.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.10.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-44997.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-44997"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
