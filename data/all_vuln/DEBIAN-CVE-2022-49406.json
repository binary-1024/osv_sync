As a result, in blk_ia_range_sysfs_show(), there is no need to take the queue sysfs lock when reading the value of a range attribute. Using the queue sysfs lock in this function creates a potential deadlock situation with the disk removal, something that a lockdep signals with a splat when the device is removed:  [  760.703551]  Possible unsafe locking scenario: [  760.703551] [  760.703554]        CPU0                    CPU1 [  760.703556]        ----                    ---- [  760.703558]   lock(&q->sysfs_lock); [  760.703565]                                lock(kn->active#385); [  760.703573]                                lock(&q->sysfs_lock); [  760.703579]   lock(kn->active#385); [  760.703587] [  760.703587]  *** DEADLOCK ***  Solve this by removing the mutex_lock()/mutex_unlock() calls from blk_ia_range_sysfs_show().","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49406.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49406.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49406.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-49406"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
