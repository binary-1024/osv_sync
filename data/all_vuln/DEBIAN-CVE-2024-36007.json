This is done by iterating over all chunks (all the filters with the same priority) in the region and in each chunk iterating over all the filters.  When the work runs out of credits it stores the current chunk and entry as markers in the per-work context so that it would know where to resume the migration from the next time the work is scheduled.  Upon error, the chunk marker is reset to NULL, but without resetting the entry markers despite being relative to it. This can result in migration being resumed from an entry that does not belong to the chunk being migrated. In turn, this will eventually lead to a chunk being iterated over as if it is an entry. Because of how the two structures happen to be defined, this does not lead to KASAN splats, but to warnings such as [1].  Fix by creating a helper that resets all the markers and call it from all the places the currently only reset the chunk marker. For good measures also call it when starting a completely new rehash. Add a warning to avoid future cases.
