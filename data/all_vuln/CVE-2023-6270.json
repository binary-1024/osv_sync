The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on `struct net_device`, and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq` global queue. This could lead to a denial of service condition or potential code execution.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-6270"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2256786"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00017.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00020.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
