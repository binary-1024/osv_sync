{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50627","published":"2025-12-08T02:15:48.797Z","modified":"2025-12-08T11:06:44.425310Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-50627"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath11k: fix monitor mode bringup crash  When the interface is brought up in monitor mode, it leads to NULL pointer dereference crash. This crash happens when the packet type is extracted for a SKB. This extraction which is present in the received msdu delivery path,is not needed for the monitor ring packets since they are all RAW packets. Hence appending the flags with \"RX_FLAG_ONLY_MONITOR\" to skip that extraction.
