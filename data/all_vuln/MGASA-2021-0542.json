This meant that containers running\n  on a FIPS mode kernel would not enable FIPS mode without the crypto\n  policy being changed. With this update, OpenJDK queries the NSS library\n  as to whether FIPS mode is active or not. (RHBZ#2014201)\n  The use of the NSS FIPS mode by OpenJDK requires the JDK to login to the\n  NSS software token. Previously, this happened indirectly as part of some\n  crypto operations, but not others. With this update, the JDK logs in to\n  the token on initialisation. (RHBZ#2014204)\n  While in FIPS mode, the NSS Software Token does not allow the import of\n  private or secret plain keys. This caused the OpenJDK keytool\n  application to fail when used with OpenJDK in FIPS mode. With this\n  update, OpenJDK will now import such keys into the NSS database. This\n  behaviour may be disabled using -Dcom.redhat.fips.plainKeySupport=false.\n  (RHBZ#2014193)\n  \nThe java-11-openjdk packages provide the OpenJDK 11 Java Runtime\nEnvironment and the OpenJDK 11 Java Software Development Kit.\n Security Fix(es):\n  OpenJDK: Loop in HttpsServer triggered during TLS session close (JSSE,\n   8254967) (CVE-2021-35565)\n  OpenJDK: Incorrect principal selection when using Kerberos Constrained\n   Delegation (Libraries, 8266689) (CVE-2021-35567)\n  OpenJDK: Weak ciphers preferred over stronger ones for TLS (JSSE,\n   8264210) (CVE-2021-35550)\n  OpenJDK: Excessive memory allocation in RTFParser (Swing, 8265167)\n   (CVE-2021-35556)\n  OpenJDK: Excessive memory allocation in RTFReader (Swing, 8265580)\n   (CVE-2021-35559)\n  OpenJDK: Excessive memory allocation in HashMap and HashSet (Utility,\n   8266097) (CVE-2021-35561)\n  OpenJDK: Certificates with end dates too far in the future can corrupt\n   keystore (Keytool, 8266137) (CVE-2021-35564)\n  OpenJDK: Unexpected exception raised during TLS handshake (JSSE,\n   8267729) (CVE-2021-35578)\n  OpenJDK: Excessive memory allocation in BMPImageReader (ImageIO,\n   8267735) (CVE-2021-35586)\n  OpenJDK: Non-constant comparison during TLS handshakes (JSSE,\n   8269618) (CVE-2021-35603)\n",
