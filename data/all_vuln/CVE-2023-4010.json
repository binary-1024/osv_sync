The usb_giveback_urb function has a logic loophole in its implementation. Due to the inappropriate judgment condition of the goto statement, the function cannot return under the input of a specific malformed descriptor file, so it falls into an endless loop, resulting in a denial of service.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4010"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2227726"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/wanrenmi/a-usb-kernel-bug"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
