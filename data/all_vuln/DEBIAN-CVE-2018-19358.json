One perspective is that this occurs because available D-Bus protection mechanisms (involving the busconfig and policy XML elements) are not used. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because, according to the security model, untrusted applications must not be allowed to access the user's session bus socket.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gnome-keyring","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gnome-keyring?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.36.0-1","40.0-1","40.0-2","40.0-3","42.1-1","42.1-2","46.1-1","46.1-2","46.2-1","48.0-1","48.0-2","48.0-3","48.0-4","48~beta-1","48~beta-2","48~beta-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-19358.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnome-keyring","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gnome-keyring?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["42.1-1","42.1-2","46.1-1","46.1-2","46.2-1","48.0-1","48.0-2","48.0-3","48.0-4","48~beta-1","48~beta-2","48~beta-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-19358.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnome-keyring","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gnome-keyring?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["48.0-1","48.0-2","48.0-3","48.0-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-19358.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnome-keyring","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gnome-keyring?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["48.0-1","48.0-2","48.0-3","48.0-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-19358.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-19358"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
