There is a reachable abort in\nObject.h, will lead to denial of service because EmbFile::save2 in\nFileSpec.cc lacks a stream check before saving an embedded file.\n(CVE-2018-19058)\n\nAn issue was discovered in Poppler 0.71.0. There is a out-of-bounds read\nin EmbFile::save2 in FileSpec.cc, will lead to denial of service, as\ndemonstrated by utils/pdfdetach.cc not validating embedded files before\nsave attempts.
