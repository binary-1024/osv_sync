This commit\nfixes this issue by decreasing the reference counts when 'target_ids' is\nwritten.","references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ebb3f994dd92f8fb4d70c7541091216c1e10cb71"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ffe4a1ba1a82c416a6b3a09d46594f6a885ae141"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
