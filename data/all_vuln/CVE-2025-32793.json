Versions 1.15.0 to 1.15.15, 1.16.0 to 1.16.8, and 1.17.0 to 1.17.2, are vulnerable when using Wireguard transparent encryption in a Cilium cluster, packets that originate from a terminating endpoint can leave the source node without encryption due to a race condition in how traffic is processed by Cilium. This issue has been patched in versions 1.15.16, 1.16.9, and 1.17.3. There are no workarounds available for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium","events":[{"introduced":"c9723a8df3cfa336da1f8457a864105d8349acfe"},{"fixed":"a0ee30f5ee96eaf4766453e0cae7759a6965b90d"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-32793.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-5vxx-c285-pcq4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/38592"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-319"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
