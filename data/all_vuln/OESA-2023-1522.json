  "details": "QEMU is a FAST! processor emulator using dynamic translation to achieve good emulation speed. QEMU has two operating modes: Full system emulation. In this mode, QEMU emulates a full system (for example a PC), including one or several processors and various peripherals. It can be used to launch different Operating Systems without rebooting the PC or to debug system code. User mode emulation. In this mode, QEMU can launch processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU. It can be used to launch the Wine Windows API emulator (https://www.winehq.org) or to ease cross-compilation and cross-debugging. You can refer to https://www.qemu.org for more infortmation.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA flaw was found in the QEMU virtual crypto device while handling data encryption/decryption requests in virtio_crypto_handle_sym_req. There is no check for the value of `src_len` and `dst_len` in virtio_crypto_sym_op_helper, potentially leading to a heap buffer overflow when the two values differ.(CVE-2023-3180)",
