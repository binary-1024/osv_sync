  "details": "When injecting an HTML base element, some requests would ignore the CSP's\nbase-uri settings and accept the injected element's base instead\n(CVE-2022-40956).\n\nBy injecting a cookie with certain special characters, an attacker on a\nshared subdomain which is not a secure context could set and thus overwrite\ncookies from a secure context, leading to session fixation and other attacks\n(CVE-2022-40958).\n\nDuring iframe navigation, certain pages did not have their FeaturePolicy\nfully initialized leading to a bypass that leaked device permissions into\nuntrusted subdocuments (CVE-2022-40959).\n\nConcurrent use of the URL parser with non-UTF-8 data was not thread-safe.\nThis could lead to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash\n(CVE-2022-40960).\n\nMozilla developers Nika Layzell, Timothy Nikkel, Jeff Muizelaar, Sebastian\nHengst, Andreas Pehrson, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety\nbugs present in Thunderbird 102.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of\nmemory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could\nhave been exploited to run arbitrary code (CVE-2022-40962).\n",
