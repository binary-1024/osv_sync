Due to limitations in the internal bufio.Scanner, the read fails with &quot;token too long&quot; and the writer pipe is closed, leaving Writer() unusable and causing application unavailability (DoS). This affects versions &lt; 1.8.3, 1.9.0, and 1.9.2. The issue is fixed in 1.8.3, 1.9.1, and 1.9.3+, where the input is chunked and the writer continues to function even if an error is logged.(CVE-2025-65637)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"runc","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/runc&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.1.8-29.oe2403sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["runc-1.1.8-29.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["runc-1.1.8-29.oe2403sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["runc-1.1.8-29.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2026-1271.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2026-1271"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65637"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
