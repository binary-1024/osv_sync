{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68262","published":"2025-12-16T15:15:55.697Z","modified":"2025-12-17T11:11:24.792457Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-68262"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: zstd - fix double-free in per-CPU stream cleanup  The crypto/zstd module has a double-free bug that occurs when multiple tfms are allocated and freed.  The issue happens because zstd_streams (per-CPU contexts) are freed in zstd_exit() during every tfm destruction, rather than being managed at the module level.  When multiple tfms exist, each tfm exit attempts to free the same shared per-CPU streams, resulting in a double-free.  This leads to a stack trace similar to:    BUG: Bad page state in process kworker/u16:1  pfn:106fd93   page: refcount:0 mapcount:0 mapping:0000000000000000 index:0x0 pfn:0x106fd93   flags: 0x17ffffc0000000(node=0|zone=2|lastcpupid=0x1fffff)   page_type: 0xffffffff()   raw: 0017ffffc0000000 dead000000000100 dead000000000122 0000000000000000   raw: 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 00000000ffffffff 0000000000000000   page dumped because: nonzero entire_mapcount   Modules linked in: ...
