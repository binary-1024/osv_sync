Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS instead of usingan insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. ThisHSTS mechanism would however surprisingly be ignored by subsequent transferswhen done on the same command line because the state would not be properlycarried on.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/curl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["7.74.0-1.3","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u1","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u10","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u11","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u12","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u13","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u14","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u15","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u2","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u3","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u4","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u5","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u6","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u7","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u7~bpo11+1","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u8","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u9","7.79.1-1","7.79.1-2","7.79.1-3~exp1","7.79.1-3~exp2","7.80.0-1","7.80.0-2","7.80.0-3","7.81.0-1","7.81.0-1~bpo11+1","7.82.0-1","7.82.0-2","7.82.0-2~bpo11+1","7.83.0-1","7.83.1-1","7.83.1-2","7.84.0-1","7.84.0-2","7.84.0-2~bpo11+1","7.85.0-1","7.85.0-1~bpo11+1","7.86.0-1","7.86.0-2","7.86.0-3","7.87.0-1","7.87.0-1~bpo11+1","7.87.0-2","7.87.0-2~bpo11+1","7.88.1-1","7.88.1-10","7.88.1-11","7.88.1-1~bpo11+1","7.88.1-2","7.88.1-2~exp1","7.88.1-2~exp2","7.88.1-2~exp3","7.88.1-2~exp4","7.88.1-3","7.88.1-4","7.88.1-5","7.88.1-6","7.88.1-7","7.88.1-7~bpo11+1","7.88.1-7~bpo11+2","7.88.1-7~exp1","7.88.1-8","7.88.1-8~exp1","7.88.1-9","8.0.1-1~exp1","8.10.0-1","8.10.0-2","8.10.1-1","8.10.1-1~bpo12+1","8.10.1-2","8.11.0-1","8.11.1-1","8.11.1-1~bpo12+1","8.12.0+git20250209.89ed161+ds-1","8.12.0+git20250209.89ed161+ds-1~bpo12+1","8.12.1-1","8.12.1-2","8.12.1-2~bpo12+1","8.12.1-3","8.12.1-3~bpo12+1","8.13.0-1","8.13.0-1+exp1","8.13.0-2","8.13.0-2+exp1","8.13.0-3","8.13.0-4","8.13.0-4+exp1","8.13.0-5","8.13.0-5+exp1","8.13.0-5~bpo12+1","8.13.0~rc-1~exp1","8.13.0~rc-1~exp2","8.13.0~rc2-1","8.13.0~rc2-2","8.13.0~rc3-1","8.13.0~rc3-1+exp1","8.14.0-1","8.14.0-1+exp1","8.14.0~rc1-1+exp1","8.14.0~rc2-1+exp1","8.14.0~rc3-1+exp1","8.14.1-1","8.14.1-1~bpo12+1","8.14.1-2","8.14.1-2+exp1","8.14.1-2~bpo12+1","8.15.0-1","8.15.0-1~bpo13+1","8.15.0-1~exp1","8.15.0~rc1-1exp1","8.15.0~rc2-1~exp1","8.15.0~rc3-1~exp1","8.16.0-1","8.16.0-1+exp1","8.16.0-1~bpo13+1","8.16.0~rc1-1~exp1","8.16.0~rc2-1","8.16.0~rc2-2","8.16.0~rc3-1","8.2.1-1","8.2.1-2","8.2.1-2~bpo12+1","8.3.0-1","8.3.0-2","8.3.0-2~bpo12+1","8.3.0-2~exp1","8.3.0-3","8.4.0-1","8.4.0-2","8.4.0-2~bpo12+1","8.5.0-1","8.5.0-1+exp1","8.5.0-2","8.5.0-2+exp1","8.5.0-2~bpo12+1","8.6.0-1","8.6.0-1.1","8.6.0-2","8.6.0-3","8.6.0-3.1","8.6.0-3.1~exp1","8.6.0-3.1~exp2","8.6.0-3.2","8.6.0-4","8.7.1-1","8.7.1-1+exp1","8.7.1-2","8.7.1-3","8.7.1-4","8.7.1-5","8.7.1-5+exp1","8.7.1-5~bpo12+1","8.8.0-1","8.8.0-1+exp1","8.8.0-1+exp2","8.8.0-1~bpo12+1","8.8.0-2","8.8.0-3","8.8.0-4","8.9.0-1","8.9.0-2","8.9.0-3","8.9.1-1","8.9.1-2","8.9.1-2~bpo12+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-23914.json"}},{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/curl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.88.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-23914.json"}},{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/curl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.88.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-23914.json"}},{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/curl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.88.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-23914.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-23914"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
