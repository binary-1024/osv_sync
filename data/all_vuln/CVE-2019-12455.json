{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2019-12455","published":"2019-05-30T04:29:02Z","modified":"2025-08-09T19:01:28Z","details":"An issue was discovered in sunxi_divs_clk_setup in drivers/clk/sunxi/clk-sunxi.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kstrndup of derived_name, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash). NOTE: This id is disputed as not being an issue because “The memory allocation that was not checked is part of a code that only runs at boot time, before user processes are started. Therefore, there is no possibility for an unprivileged user to control it, and no denial of service.”","references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sunxi/linux.git/commit/?h=sunxi/clk-for-5.3&id=fcdf445ff42f036d22178b49cf64e92d527c1330"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190710-0002/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/J36BIJTKEPUOZKJNHQBUZA47RQONUKOI/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel%40vger.kernel.org/msg2010240.html"}],"database_specific":{"isDisputed":true},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
