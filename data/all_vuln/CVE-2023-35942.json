Prior to versions 1.27.0, 1.26.4, 1.25.9, 1.24.10, and 1.23.12, gRPC access loggers using listener's global scope can cause a `use-after-free` crash when the listener is drained. Versions 1.27.0, 1.26.4, 1.25.9, 1.24.10, and 1.23.12 have a fix for this issue. As a workaround, disable gRPC access log or stop listener update.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy","events":[{"introduced":"ce49c7f65668a22b80d1e83c35d170741bb8d46a"},{"fixed":"9689bc57f80fe56dbb16a4e0d632cde5363d1811"}]}],"versions":["v1.23.0","v1.23.1","v1.23.10","v1.23.11","v1.23.2","v1.23.3","v1.23.4","v1.23.5","v1.23.6","v1.23.7","v1.23.8","v1.23.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-35942.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/35xxx/CVE-2023-35942.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-69vr-g55c-v2v4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35942"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-416"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/35xxx/CVE-2023-35942.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
