Prior to version 0.40.3, the Eventlet WSGI parser is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling due to improper handling of HTTP trailer sections. This vulnerability could enable attackers to, bypass front-end security controls, launch targeted attacks against active site users, and poison web caches. This problem has been patched in Eventlet 0.40.3 by dropping trailers which is a breaking change if a backend behind eventlet.wsgi proxy requires trailers. A workaround involves not using eventlet.wsgi facing untrusted clients.(CVE-2025-58068)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-eventlet","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python-eventlet&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.33.3-3.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"noarch":["python-eventlet-help-0.33.3-3.oe2403.noarch.rpm","python3-eventlet-0.33.3-3.oe2403.noarch.rpm"],"src":["python-eventlet-0.33.3-3.oe2403.src.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2232.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2232"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-58068"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
