  "details": "Eventlet is a concurrent networking library for Python that allows you to change how you run your code, not how you write it.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nEventlet is a concurrent networking library for Python. Prior to version 0.40.3, the Eventlet WSGI parser is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling due to improper handling of HTTP trailer sections. This vulnerability could enable attackers to, bypass front-end security controls, launch targeted attacks against active site users, and poison web caches. This problem has been patched in Eventlet 0.40.3 by dropping trailers which is a breaking change if a backend behind eventlet.wsgi proxy requires trailers. A workaround involves not using eventlet.wsgi facing untrusted clients.(CVE-2025-58068)",
