In versions prior to 1.16.1, the password authentication mechanism transmits passwords via URL query parameters instead of the HTTP request body. This causes passwords to be logged in server access logs and potentially exposed through browser history, Referer headers, and proxy logs. Version 1.16.1 patches the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/quenary/tugtainer","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"798cf38c18ad9cf919386e8a56c3f699d67f7b93"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.10.0","v1.11.0","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.12.2","v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.14.0","v1.14.1","v1.14.2","v1.14.3","v1.14.4","v1.15.0","v1.15.1","v1.15.2","v1.16.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.8.0","v1.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23846.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23846.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Quenary/tugtainer/commit/9d23bf40ac1d39005582abfcf0a84753a4e29d52"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Quenary/tugtainer/security/advisories/GHSA-f2qf-f544-xm4p"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23846"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-598"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23846.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
