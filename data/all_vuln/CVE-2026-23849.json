{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-23849","published":"2026-01-19T20:37:29.716Z","modified":"2026-01-20T19:48:24.354218Z","aliases":["GHSA-43mm-m3h2-3prc"],"summary":"File Browser vulnerable to Username Enumeration via Timing Attack in /api/login","details":"File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename, and edit files. Prior to version 2.55.0, the JSONAuth. Auth function contains a logic flaw that allows unauthenticated attackers to enumerate valid usernames by measuring the response time of the /api/login endpoint. The vulnerability exists due to a \"short-circuit\" evaluation in the authentication logic. When a username is not found in the database, the function returns immediately. However, if the username does exist, the code proceeds to verify the password using bcrypt (users.CheckPwd), which is a computationally expensive operation designed to be slow. This difference in execution path creates a measurable timing discrepancy. Version 2.55.0 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"08c8ede587240472cd1524e40e514fc2bbc3466e"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.55.0"}]}}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.10.0","v1.11.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.2.9","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.10","v1.3.11","v1.3.12","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.3.7","v1.3.8","v1.3.9","v1.4.0","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.4.6","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.5.5","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.8.0","v1.9.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-rc.1","v2.0.0-rc.2","v2.0.1","v2.0.10","v2.0.11","v2.0.12","v2.0.13","v2.0.14","v2.0.15","v2.0.16","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.0.6","v2.0.7","v2.0.8","v2.0.9","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.10.0","v2.11.0","v2.12.0","v2.12.1","v2.13.0","v2.14.0","v2.14.1","v2.15.0","v2.16.0","v2.16.1","v2.17.0","v2.17.1","v2.17.2","v2.18.0","v2.19.0","v2.2.0","v2.20.0","v2.20.1","v2.21.0","v2.21.1","v2.22.0","v2.22.1","v2.22.2","v2.22.3","v2.22.4","v2.23.0","v2.24.0","v2.24.1","v2.24.2","v2.25.0","v2.26.0","v2.27.0","v2.28.0","v2.29.0","v2.3.0","v2.30.0","v2.31.0","v2.31.1","v2.31.2","v2.32.0","v2.32.1","v2.32.2","v2.32.3","v2.33.0","v2.33.1","v2.33.10","v2.33.2","v2.33.3","v2.33.4","v2.33.5","v2.33.6","v2.33.7","v2.33.8","v2.33.9","v2.34.0","v2.34.1","v2.34.2","v2.35.0","v2.36.0","v2.36.1","v2.36.2","v2.36.3","v2.37.0","v2.38.0","v2.39.0","v2.4.0","v2.40.0","v2.40.1","v2.40.2","v2.41.0","v2.42.0","v2.42.1","v2.42.2","v2.42.3","v2.42.4","v2.42.5","v2.43.0","v2.44.0","v2.44.1","v2.44.2","v2.45.0","v2.45.1","v2.45.2","v2.45.3","v2.46.0","v2.46.1","v2.47.0","v2.48.0","v2.48.1","v2.48.2","v2.49.0","v2.5.0","v2.50.0","v2.51.0","v2.51.1","v2.51.2","v2.52.0","v2.53.0","v2.53.1","v2.54.0","v2.6.0","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.7.0","v2.8.0","v2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23849.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23849.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/commit/24781badd413ee20333aba5cce1919d676e01889"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/security/advisories/GHSA-43mm-m3h2-3prc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23849"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-208"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23849.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
