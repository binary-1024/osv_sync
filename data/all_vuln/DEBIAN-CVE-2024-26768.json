{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-26768","published":"2024-04-03T17:15:52Z","modified":"2025-10-14T04:26:30.623326Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-26768"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  LoongArch: Change acpi_core_pic[NR_CPUS] to acpi_core_pic[MAX_CORE_PIC]  With default config, the value of NR_CPUS is 64. When HW platform has more then 64 cpus, system will crash on these platforms. MAX_CORE_PIC is the maximum cpu number in MADT table (max physical number) which can exceed the supported maximum cpu number (NR_CPUS, max logical number), but kernel should not crash. Kernel should boot cpus with NR_CPUS, let the remainder cpus stay in BIOS.  The potential crash reason is that the array acpi_core_pic[NR_CPUS] can be overflowed when parsing MADT table, and it is obvious that CORE_PIC should be corresponding to physical core rather than logical core, so it is better to define the array as acpi_core_pic[MAX_CORE_PIC].  With the patch, system can boot up 64 vcpus with qemu parameter -smp 128, otherwise system will crash with the following message.
