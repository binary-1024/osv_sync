There can be a use-after-free in the packet processing context, because the per-CPU sequence count is mishandled during concurrent iptables rules replacement. This could be exploited with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in an unprivileged namespace. NOTE: cc00bca was reverted in 5.12.(CVE-2020-36694)\n\nA use-after-free vulnerability was found in drm_lease_held in drivers/gpu/drm/drm_lease.c in the Linux kernel due to a race problem.
