Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.9.3, contracts using `ERC2771Context` along with a custom trusted forwarder may see `_msgSender` return `address(0)` in calls that originate from the forwarder with calldata shorter than 20 bytes. This combination of circumstances does not appear to be common, in particular it is not the case for `MinimalForwarder` from OpenZeppelin Contracts, or any deployed forwarder the team is aware of, given that the signer address is appended to all calls that originate from these forwarders. The problem has been patched in v4.9.3.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"smart","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/smart@1.4-2?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.4-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"python-smartpm","binary_version":"1.4-2"},{"binary_name":"smartpm","binary_version":"1.4-2"},{"binary_name":"smartpm-core","binary_version":"1.4-2"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2023/UBUNTU-CVE-2023-40014.json"}},{"package":{"name":"smart","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/smart@1.4-2?arch=source&distro=bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.4-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"python-smartpm","binary_version":"1.4-2"},{"binary_name":"smartpm","binary_version":"1.4-2"},{"binary_name":"smartpm-core","binary_version":"1.4-2"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2023/UBUNTU-CVE-2023-40014.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2023-40014"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/commit/9445f96223041abf2bf08daa56f8da50b674cbcd"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4484"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v4.9.3"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4481"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/commit/e4435eed757d4309436b1e06608e97b6d6e2fdb5"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-g4vp-m682-qqmp"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-40014"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"},{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
