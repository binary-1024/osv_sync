An authenticated and authorized user can bypass connection URL validation using custom input formatting. The resolution enhances connection URL validation and introduces validation for additional related properties. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 1.23.1 is the recommended mitigation.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nifi","ecosystem":"Bitnami","purl":"pkg:bitnami/nifi"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.21.0"},{"fixed":"1.23.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/bitnami/vulndb/tree/main/data/nifi/BIT-nifi-2023-40037.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/08/18/2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/bqbjlrs2p5ghh8sbk5nsxb8xpf9l687q"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://nifi.apache.org/security.html#CVE-2023-40037"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40037"}],"database_specific":{"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:apache:nifi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"severity":"Medium"}}
