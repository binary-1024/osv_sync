  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: VMX: Prevent RSB underflow before vmenter\n\nOn VMX, there are some balanced returns between the time the guest's\nSPEC_CTRL value is written, and the vmenter.\n\nBalanced returns (matched by a preceding call) are usually ok, but it's\nat least theoretically possible an NMI with a deep call stack could\nempty the RSB before one of the returns.\n\nFor maximum paranoia, don't allow *any* returns (balanced or otherwise)\nbetween the SPEC_CTRL write and the vmenter.\n\n  [ bp: Fix 32-bit build. ]",
