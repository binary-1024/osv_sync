NOTE: this is disputed by the vendor because (1) neither 3.7 nor any other release is affected (it is a bug in some 3.12 pre-releases); (2) there are no common scenarios in which an adversary can call _asyncio._swap_current_task but does not already have the ability to call arbitrary functions; and (3) there are no common scenarios in which sensitive information, which is not already accessible to an adversary, becomes accessible through this bug.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python","ecosystem":"Bitnami","purl":"pkg:bitnami/python"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"3.13.0-alpha0"},{"last_affected":"3.13.0-alpha0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/bitnami/vulndb/tree/main/data/python/BIT-python-2023-38898.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105987"}],"database_specific":{"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.13.0:alpha0:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"severity":"Medium"}}
