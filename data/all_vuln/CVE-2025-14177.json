This occurs due to a bug in php_read_stream_all_chunks() that overwrites the buffer without advancing the pointer, leaving tail bytes uninitialized. This may lead to information disclosure of sensitive heap data and affect the confidentiality of the target server.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/php/php-src","events":[{"introduced":"381ba9f5d0edd0c9c8ec1dea7e21d513ad08b115"},{"fixed":"94abff74457effe4432f0bd49f5230aa11155dff"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-14177.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/php/php-src/security/advisories/GHSA-3237-qqm7-mfv7"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
