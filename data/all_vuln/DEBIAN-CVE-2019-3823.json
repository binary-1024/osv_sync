If the buffer passed to `smtp_endofresp()` isn't NUL terminated and contains no character ending the parsed number, and `len` is set to 5, then the `strtol()` call reads beyond the allocated buffer. The read contents will not be returned to the caller.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/curl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.64.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-3823.json"}},{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/curl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.64.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-3823.json"}},{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/curl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.64.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-3823.json"}},{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/curl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.64.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-3823.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3823"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
