By default, it uses a fixed temporary directory /tmp/sarg. As the root user, sarg creates this directory or reuses an existing one in an insecure manner. An attacker can pre-create the directory, and place symlinks in it (after winning a /tmp/sarg/denied.int_unsort race condition). The outcome will be corrupted or newly created files in privileged file system locations.","references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00051.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00063.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/01/20/6"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/01/27/1"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1150554"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2020/q1/23"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202007-32"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/sarg/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
