{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-1665","published":"2026-01-29T23:16:11.707Z","modified":"2026-01-30T22:53:03.678002Z","details":"A command injection vulnerability exists in nvm (Node Version Manager) versions 0.40.3 and below. The nvm_download() function uses eval to execute wget commands, and the NVM_AUTH_HEADER environment variable was not sanitized in the wget code path (though it was sanitized in the curl code path). An attacker who can set environment variables in a victim's shell environment (e.g., via malicious CI/CD configurations, compromised dotfiles, or Docker images) can inject arbitrary shell commands that execute when the victim runs nvm commands that trigger downloads, such as 'nvm install' or 'nvm ls-remote'.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"44e2590cdf257faf7d885e4470be8dc66cec9506"},{"fixed":"62387b8f92aa012d48202747fd75c40850e5e261"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.6","v0.1.0","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.11.2","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.12.2","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.14.0","v0.15.0","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.17.2","v0.17.3","v0.18.0","v0.19.0","v0.2.0","v0.20.0","v0.21.0","v0.22.0","v0.22.1","v0.22.2","v0.23.0","v0.23.1","v0.23.2","v0.23.3","v0.24.0","v0.24.1","v0.25.0","v0.25.1","v0.25.2","v0.25.3","v0.25.4","v0.26.0","v0.26.1","v0.27.0","v0.27.1","v0.28.0","v0.29.0","v0.3.0","v0.30.0","v0.30.1","v0.30.2","v0.31.0","v0.31.1","v0.31.2","v0.31.3","v0.31.4","v0.31.5","v0.31.6","v0.31.7","v0.32.0","v0.32.1","v0.33.0","v0.33.1","v0.33.10","v0.33.11","v0.33.2","v0.33.3","v0.33.4","v0.33.5","v0.33.6","v0.33.7","v0.33.8","v0.33.9","v0.34.0","v0.35.0","v0.35.1","v0.35.2","v0.35.3","v0.36.0","v0.37.0","v0.37.1","v0.37.2","v0.38.0","v0.39.0","v0.39.1","v0.39.2","v0.39.3","v0.39.4","v0.39.5","v0.39.6","v0.39.7","v0.4.0","v0.40.0","v0.40.1","v0.40.2","v0.40.3","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-1665.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/releases/tag/v0.40.4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/commit/44e2590cdf257faf7d885e4470be8dc66cec9506"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/pull/3380"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
