{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68801","published":"2026-01-13T16:16:02.137Z","modified":"2026-01-14T11:11:03.499431Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-68801"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mlxsw: spectrum_router: Fix neighbour use-after-free  We sometimes observe use-after-free when dereferencing a neighbour [1]. The problem seems to be that the driver stores a pointer to the neighbour, but without holding a reference on it. A reference is only taken when the neighbour is used by a nexthop.  Fix by simplifying the reference counting scheme. Always take a reference when storing a neighbour pointer in a neighbour entry. Avoid taking a referencing when the neighbour is used by a nexthop as the neighbour entry associated with the nexthop already holds a reference.  Tested by running the test that uncovered the problem over 300 times. Without this patch the problem was reproduced after a handful of iterations.
