However, the bank_map which contains a bitfield of which banks to initialize is of type unsigned int and that overflows when those bit numbers are >= 32, leading to UBSAN complaining correctly:    UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mce/amd.c:1365:38   shift exponent 32 is too large for 32-bit type 'int'  Change the bank_map to a u64 and use the proper BIT_ULL() macro when modifying bits in there.
