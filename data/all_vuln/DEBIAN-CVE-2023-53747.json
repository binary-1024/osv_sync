{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53747","published":"2025-12-08T02:15:50.057Z","modified":"2025-12-08T11:06:55.913576Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-53747"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vc_screen: reload load of struct vc_data pointer in vcs_write() to avoid UAF  After a call to console_unlock() in vcs_write() the vc_data struct can be freed by vc_port_destruct(). Because of that, the struct vc_data pointer must be reloaded in the while loop in vcs_write() after console_lock() to avoid a UAF when vcs_size() is called.  Syzkaller reported a UAF in vcs_size().
