NOTE: because this issue is due to incorrect use of the Intel specification, it should have been split into separate identifiers; however, there was some value in preserving the original mapping of the multi-codebase coordinated-disclosure effort to a single identifier.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"xen","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xen?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.1.3~rc1+hg-20120614.a9c0a89c08f2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2012-0217.json"}},{"package":{"name":"xen","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xen?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.1.3~rc1+hg-20120614.a9c0a89c08f2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2012-0217.json"}},{"package":{"name":"xen","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xen?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.1.3~rc1+hg-20120614.a9c0a89c08f2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2012-0217.json"}},{"package":{"name":"xen","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xen?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.1.3~rc1+hg-20120614.a9c0a89c08f2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2012-0217.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0217"}]}
