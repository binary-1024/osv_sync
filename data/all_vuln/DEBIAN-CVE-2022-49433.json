  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/hfi1: Prevent use of lock before it is initialized  If there is a failure during probe of hfi1 before the sdma_map_lock is initialized, the call to hfi1_free_devdata() will attempt to use a lock that has not been initialized. If the locking correctness validator is on then an INFO message and stack trace resembling the following may be seen:    INFO: trying to register non-static key.   The code is fine but needs lockdep annotation, or maybe   you didn't initialize this object before use?   turning off the locking correctness validator.   Call Trace:   register_lock_class+0x11b/0x880   __lock_acquire+0xf3/0x7930   lock_acquire+0xff/0x2d0   _raw_spin_lock_irq+0x46/0x60   sdma_clean+0x42a/0x660 [hfi1]   hfi1_free_devdata+0x3a7/0x420 [hfi1]   init_one+0x867/0x11a0 [hfi1]   pci_device_probe+0x40e/0x8d0  The use of sdma_map_lock in sdma_clean() is for freeing the sdma_map memory, and sdma_map is not allocated/initialized until after sdma_map_lock has been initialized. This code only needs to be run if sdma_map is not NULL, and so checking for that condition will avoid trying to use the lock before it is initialized.",
