This occurs because the server allocates memory for the command arguments of every bulk, even when the command is skipped because of insufficient permissions. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because abuse of the commands network protocol is not a violation of the Redis Security Model.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"keydb","ecosystem":"Bitnami","purl":"pkg:bitnami/keydb"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"8.0.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/bitnami/vulndb/tree/main/data/keydb/BIT-keydb-2025-46686.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/io-no/CVE-Reports/issues/1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-2r7g-8hpc-rpq9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46686"}],"database_specific":{"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"severity":"Low"}}
