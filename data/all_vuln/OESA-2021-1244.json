  "details": "OpenLDAP is an open source suite of LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) applications and development tools. LDAP is a set of protocols for accessing directory services (usually phone book style information, but other information is possible) over the Internet, similar to the way DNS (Domain Name System) information is propagated over the Internet. The openldap package contains configuration files, libraries, and documentation for OpenLDAP.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in OpenLDAP in versions before 2.4.56. This flaw allows an attacker who sends a malicious packet processed by OpenLDAP to force a failed assertion in csnNormalize23(). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2020-25710)",
