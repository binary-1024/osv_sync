  "details": "Multiple flaws were discovered in the Libraries, 2D, and Hotspot components\nin OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws\nto bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions (CVE-2014-6506, CVE-2014-6531,\nCVE-2014-6502, CVE-2014-6511, CVE-2014-6504, CVE-2014-6519).\n\nIt was discovered that the StAX XML parser in the JAXP component in OpenJDK\nperformed expansion of external parameter entities even when external\nentity substitution was disabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\nperform XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attack against applications using the\nStAX parser to parse untrusted XML documents (CVE-2014-6517).\n\nIt was discovered that the DatagramSocket implementation in OpenJDK failed\nto perform source address checks for packets received on a connected\nsocket. A remote attacker could use this flaw to have their packets\nprocessed as if they were received from the expected source\n(CVE-2014-6512).\n\nIt was discovered that the TLS/SSL implementation in the JSSE component in\nOpenJDK failed to properly verify the server identity during the\nrenegotiation following session resumption, making it possible for\nmalicious TLS/SSL servers to perform a Triple Handshake attack against\nclients using JSSE and client certificate authentication (CVE-2014-6457).\n\nIt was discovered that the CipherInputStream class implementation in\nOpenJDK did not properly handle certain exceptions. This could possibly\nallow an attacker to affect the integrity of an encrypted stream handled by\nthis class (CVE-2014-6558).\n\nThis update is based on IcedTea version 2.5.3, which fixes these issues, as\nwell as several others.\n",
