This can be utilized for request smuggling and may also lead cache poisoning if the origin servers are vulnerable.  This issue affects Apache Traffic Server: from 8.0.0 through 8.1.10, from 9.0.0 through 9.2.4.  Users can set a new setting (proxy.config.http.drop_chunked_trailers) not to forward chunked trailer section. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 8.1.11 or 9.2.5, which fixes the issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"trafficserver","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/trafficserver?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.1.11+ds-0+deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["8.1.1+ds-1.1","8.1.1+ds-1.1+deb11u1","8.1.10+ds-1~deb11u1","8.1.5+ds-1~deb11u1","8.1.6+ds-1~deb10u1","8.1.6+ds-1~deb11u1","8.1.7+ds-1~deb11u1","8.1.9+ds-1~deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-35161.json"}},{"package":{"name":"trafficserver","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/trafficserver?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.2.5+ds-0+deb12u1"}]}],"versions":["9.2.0+ds-2","9.2.0+ds-2+deb12u1","9.2.1+ds-1","9.2.2+ds-1","9.2.3+ds-1","9.2.3+ds-1+deb12u1","9.2.4+ds-0+deb12u1","9.2.4+ds-1","9.2.4+ds-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-35161.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-35161"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
