Third party programs depend on\nthis package to read internals of ELF files. \nYama sysctl setting to enable default attach scope settings\nenabling programs to use ptrace attach, access to\n/proc/PID/{mem,personality,stack,syscall}, and the syscalls\nprocess_vm_readv and process_vm_writev which are used for\ninterprocess services, communication and introspection\n(like synchronisation, signaling, debugging, tracing and\nprofiling) of processes.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability has been found in GNU elfutils 0.192 and classified as critical. This vulnerability affects the function __libdw_thread_tail in the library libdw_alloc.c of the component eu-readelf. The manipulation of the argument w leads to memory corruption. The attack can be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The name of the patch is 2636426a091bd6c6f7f02e49ab20d4cdc6bfc753. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.(CVE-2025-1352)\n\nA vulnerability was found in GNU elfutils 0.192. It has been declared as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function dump_data_section/print_string_section of the file readelf.c of the component eu-readelf. The manipulation of the argument z/x leads to buffer overflow. An attack has to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier of the patch is 73db9d2021cab9e23fd734b0a76a612d52a6f1db.
