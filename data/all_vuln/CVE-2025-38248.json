The list is consulted during forwarding to ensure\nmulticast packets are forwarded to these ports even if the ports are not\nmember in the matching MDB entry.\n\nWhen per-VLAN multicast snooping is enabled, the per-port multicast\ncontext is disabled on each port and the port is removed from the global\nrouter port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the global list even when per-VLAN\nmulticast snooping is enabled:\n\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 0\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n\nSince commit 4b30ae9adb04 (\"net: bridge: mcast: re-implement\nbr_multicast_{enable, disable}_port functions\"), when per-VLAN multicast\nsnooping is enabled, multicast disablement on a port will disable the\nper-{port, VLAN} multicast contexts and not the per-port one. As a\nresult, a port will remain in the global router port list even after it\nis deleted. This will lead to a use-after-free [1] when the list is\ntraversed (when adding a new port to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link del dev dummy1\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy2 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n\nSimilarly, stale entries can also be found in the per-VLAN router port\nlist. When per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled, the per-{port, VLAN}\ncontexts are disabled on each port and the port is removed from the\nper-VLAN router port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1 mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan global set vid 2 dev br1 mcast_snooping 1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 0\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the per-VLAN list even when\nper-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled:\n\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 0\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n\nWhen the VLAN is deleted from the port, the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext will not be disabled since multicast snooping is not enabled\non the VLAN. As a result, the port will remain in the per-VLAN router\nport list even after it is no longer member in the VLAN. This will lead\nto a use-after-free [2] when the list is traversed (when adding a new\nport to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy2\n # bridge vlan del vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy2 mcast_router 2\n\nFix these issues by removing the port from the relevant (global or\nper-VLAN) router port list in br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit(). The\nfunction is invoked during port deletion with the per-port multicast\ncontext and during VLAN deletion with the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext.\n\nNote that deleting the multicast router timer is not enough as it only\ntakes care of the temporary multicast router states (1 or 3) and not the\npermanent one (2).\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in
