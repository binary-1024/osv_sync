A maliciously configured user email in git could be used to trigger arbitrary code execution before a user accepted the workspace trust dialog. \n\nUsers on standard Claude Code auto-update will have received this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to the latest version.\n\nThank you to the NVIDIA AI Red Team for reporting this issue!",
