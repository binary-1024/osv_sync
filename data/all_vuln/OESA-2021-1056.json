  "details": "PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. PHP attempts to make it easy for developers to write dynamically generated web pages. PHP also offers built-in database integration for several commercial and non-commercial database management systems, so writing a database-enabled webpage with PHP is fairly simple. The most common use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI scripts. The php package contains the module (often referred to as mod_php) which adds support for the PHP language to Apache HTTP Server.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nWhen using certain mbstring functions to convert multibyte encodings, in PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.27, 7.3.x below 7.3.14 and 7.4.x below 7.4.2 it is possible to supply data that will cause function mbfl_filt_conv_big5_wchar to read past the allocated buffer. This may lead to information disclosure or crash.(CVE-2020-7060)\r\n\r\nIn PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.34, 7.3.x below 7.3.23 and 7.4.x below 7.4.11, when PHP is processing incoming HTTP cookie values, the cookie names are url-decoded. This may lead to cookies with prefixes like __Host confused with cookies that decode to such prefix, thus leading to an attacker being able to forge cookie which is supposed to be secure. See also CVE-2020-8184 for more information.(CVE-2020-7070)\r\n\r\nIn PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.34, 7.3.x below 7.3.23 and 7.4.x below 7.4.11, when AES-CCM mode is used with openssl_encrypt() function with 12 bytes IV, only first 7 bytes of the IV is actually used. This can lead to both decreased security and incorrect encryption data.(CVE-2020-7069)",
