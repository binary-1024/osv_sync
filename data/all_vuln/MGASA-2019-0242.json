  "details": "Updated icedtea-web packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nIt was found that in icedtea-web up to and including 1.7.2 and 1.8.2\nexecutable code could be injected in a JAR file without compromising the\nsignature verification. An attacker could use this flaw to inject code in\na trusted JAR. The code would be executed inside the sandbox.\n(CVE-2019-10181)\n\nIt was found that icedtea-web though 1.7.2 and 1.8.2 did not properly\nsanitize paths from <jar/> elements in JNLP files. An attacker could trick\na victim into running a specially crafted application and use this flaw to\nupload arbitrary files to arbitrary locations in the context of the user.\n(CVE-2019-10182)\n\nIt was found that icedtea-web up to and including 1.7.2 and 1.8.2 was\nvulnerable to a zip-slip attack during auto-extraction of a JAR file.\nAn attacker could use this flaw to write files to arbitrary locations.\nThis could also be used to replace the main running application and,\npossibly, break out of the sandbox.
