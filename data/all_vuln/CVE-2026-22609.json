Prior to version 0.1.7, the unsafe_imports() method in Fickling's static analyzer fails to flag several high-risk Python modules that can be used for arbitrary code execution. Malicious pickles importing these modules will not be detected as unsafe, allowing attackers to bypass Fickling's primary static safety checks. This issue has been patched in version 0.1.7.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"977b0769c13537cd96549c12bb537f05464cf09c"}]}],"versions":["master","v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22609.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22609.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/commit/29d5545e74b07766892c1f0461b801afccee4f91"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/commit/9a2b3f89bd0598b528d62c10a64c1986fcb09f66"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/commit/b793563e60a5e039c5837b09d7f4f6b92e6040d1"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/commit/eb299b453342f1931c787bcb3bc33f3a03a173f9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/releases/tag/v0.1.7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/security/advisories/GHSA-q5qq-mvfm-j35x"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22609"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-184","CWE-502"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22609.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
