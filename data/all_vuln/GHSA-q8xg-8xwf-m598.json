  "details": "All versions of `lix` are vulnerable to Machine-In-The-Middle. The package accepts downloads with `http` and follows `location` header redirects for package downloads. This allows for an attacker in a privileged network position to intercept a lix package installation and redirect the download to a malicious source.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
