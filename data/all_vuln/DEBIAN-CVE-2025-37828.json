  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: ufs: mcq: Add NULL check in ufshcd_mcq_abort()  A race can occur between the MCQ completion path and the abort handler: once a request completes, __blk_mq_free_request() sets rq->mq_hctx to NULL, meaning the subsequent ufshcd_mcq_req_to_hwq() call in ufshcd_mcq_abort() can return a NULL pointer. If this NULL pointer is dereferenced, the kernel will crash.  Add a NULL check for the returned hwq pointer. If hwq is NULL, log an error and return FAILED, preventing a potential NULL-pointer dereference.  As suggested by Bart, the ufshcd_cmd_inflight() check is removed.  This is similar to the fix in commit 74736103fb41 (\"scsi: ufs: core: Fix ufshcd_abort_one racing issue\").  This is found by our static analysis tool KNighter.",
