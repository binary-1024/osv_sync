{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-37828","published":"2025-05-08T07:15:54Z","modified":"2025-09-25T04:37:19.138459Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-37828"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: ufs: mcq: Add NULL check in ufshcd_mcq_abort()  A race can occur between the MCQ completion path and the abort handler: once a request completes, __blk_mq_free_request() sets rq->mq_hctx to NULL, meaning the subsequent ufshcd_mcq_req_to_hwq() call in ufshcd_mcq_abort() can return a NULL pointer. If this NULL pointer is dereferenced, the kernel will crash.  Add a NULL check for the returned hwq pointer. If hwq is NULL, log an error and return FAILED, preventing a potential NULL-pointer dereference.  As suggested by Bart, the ufshcd_cmd_inflight() check is removed.  This is similar to the fix in commit 74736103fb41 (\"scsi: ufs: core: Fix ufshcd_abort_one racing issue\").
