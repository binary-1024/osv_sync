  "details": "An issue was discovered in the DBI module before 1.643 for Perl. The\nhv_fetch() documentation requires checking for NULL and the code does that.\nBut, shortly thereafter, it calls SvOK(profile), causing a NULL pointer\ndereference. (CVE-2019-20919).\n\nAn untrusted pointer dereference flaw was found in Perl-DBI < 1.643. A local\nattacker who is able to manipulate calls to dbd_db_login6_sv() could cause\nmemory corruption, affecting the service's availability. (CVE-2020-14392).\n\nA buffer overflow was found in perl-DBI < 1.643 in DBI.xs. A local attacker\nwho is able to supply a string longer than 300 characters could cause an\nout-of-bounds write, affecting the availability of the service or integrity\nof data. (CVE-2020-14393).\n",
