  "details": "An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.7.0. A safe-error attack via Rowhammer, namely FAULT+PROBE, leads to ECDSA key disclosure. When WOLFSSL_CHECK_SIG_FAULTS is used in signing operations with private ECC keys,  such as in server-side TLS connections, the connection is halted if any fault occurs.\u00a0The success rate in a certain amount of connection requests can be processed via an advanced technique for ECDSA key recovery.",
