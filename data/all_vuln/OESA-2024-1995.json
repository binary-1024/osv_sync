As a result of\nthe bug, the endpoint_is_duplicate() routine in config.c (and possibly\nother routines as well) may believe that two descriptors are for\ndistinct endpoints, even though they have the same direction and\nendpoint number.  This can lead to confusion, including the bug\nidentified by syzbot (two descriptors with matching endpoint numbers\nand directions, where one was interrupt and the other was bulk).\r\n\r\nTo fix the bug, we will clear the reserved bits in bEndpointAddress\nwhen we parse the descriptor.  (Note that both the USB-2.0 and USB-3.1\nspecs say these bits are &quot;Reserved, reset to zero&quot;.)  This requires us\nto make a copy of the descriptor earlier in usb_parse_endpoint() and\nuse the copy instead of the original when checking for duplicates.(CVE-2024-41035)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nnetfilter: nf_tables: prefer nft_chain_validate\r\n\r\nnft_chain_validate already performs loop detection because a cycle will\nresult in a call stack overflow (ctx-&gt;level &gt;= NFT_JUMP_STACK_SIZE).\r\n\r\nIt also follows maps via -&gt;validate callback in nft_lookup, so there\nappears no reason to iterate the maps again.\r\n\r\nnf_tables_check_loops() and all its helper functions can be removed.\nThis improves ruleset load time significantly, from 23s down to 12s.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes a crash bug.

The easiest solution is to explicitly zeroize the entire\nprivate_key array first.\r\n\r\nNote that this patch slightly changes the behavior of this function:\npreviously, if the ecc_gen_privkey failed, the old private_key would\nremain. Now, the private_key is always zeroized.

If CNIC is supported it consumes 1 FP-SB thus the max number of\n  *    regular L2 queues is Y=X-1\n  * b. In MF mode the actual number of L2 queues is Y= (X-1/MF_factor)\n  * c. If the FCoE L2 queue is supported the actual number of L2 queues\n  *    is Y+1\n  * d. The number of irqs (MSIX vectors) is either Y+1 (one extra for\n  *    slow-path interrupts) or Y+2 if CNIC is supported (one additional\n  *    FP interrupt context for the CNIC).\n  * e. The number of HW context (CID count) is always X or X+1 if FCoE\n  *    L2 queue is supported. The cid for the FCoE L2 queue is always X.\n  */\r\n\r\nHowever this driver also supports NICs that use the E2 controller which can\nhandle more queues due to having more FP-SB represented by FP_SB_MAX_E2.\nLooking at the commits when the E2 support was added, it was originally\nusing the E1x parameters: commit f2e0899f0f27 (&quot;bnx2x: Add 57712 support&quot;).\nBack then FP_SB_MAX_E2 was set to 16 the same as E1x. However the driver\nwas later updated to take full advantage of the E2 instead of having it be\nlimited to the capabilities of the E1x. But as far as we can tell, the\narray &quot;stats_query_entry query&quot; was still limited to using the FP-SB\navailable to the E1x cards as part of an oversignt when the driver was\nupdated to take full advantage of the E2, and now with the driver being\naware of the greater queue size supported by E2 NICs, it causes the UBSAN\nwarnings seen in the stack traces below.\r\n\r\nThis patch increases the size of the &quot;stats_query_entry query&quot; array by\nreplacing FP_SB_MAX_E1x with FP_SB_MAX_E2 to be large enough to handle\nboth types of NICs.\r\n\r\nStack traces:\r\n\r\nUBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in\n       drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/bnx2x_stats.c:1529:11\nindex 20 is out of range for type &apos;stats_query_entry [19]&apos;\nCPU: 12 PID: 858 Comm: systemd-network Not tainted 6.9.0-060900rc7-generic\n\t     #202405052133\nHardware name: HP ProLiant DL360 Gen9/ProLiant DL360 \n---truncated---(CVE-2024-42148)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\ntcp_metrics: validate source addr length\r\n\r\nI don&apos;t see anything checking that TCP_METRICS_ATTR_SADDR_IPV4\nis at least 4 bytes long, and the policy doesn&apos;t have an entry\nfor this attribute at all (neither does it for IPv6 but v6 is\nmanually validated).(CVE-2024-42154)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\ns390/pkey: Wipe copies of clear-key structures on failure\r\n\r\nWipe all sensitive data from stack for all IOCTLs, which convert a\nclear-key into a protected- or secure-key.(CVE-2024-42156)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\ns390/pkey: Wipe sensitive data on failure\r\n\r\nWipe sensitive data from stack also if the copy_to_user() fails.(CVE-2024-42157)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\ns390/pkey: Use kfree_sensitive() to fix Coccinelle warnings\r\n\r\nReplace memzero_explicit() and kfree() with kfree_sensitive() to fix\nwarnings reported by Coccinelle:\r\n\r\nWARNING opportunity for kfree_sensitive/kvfree_sensitive (line 1506)\nWARNING opportunity for kfree_sensitive/kvfree_sensitive (line 1643)\nWARNING opportunity for kfree_sensitive/kvfree_sensitive (line 1770)(CVE-2024-42158)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nmedia: dvb-frontends: tda10048: Fix integer overflow\r\n\r\nstate-&gt;xtal_hz can be up to 16M, so it can overflow a 32 bit integer\nwhen multiplied by pll_mfactor.\r\n\r\nCreate a new 64 bit variable to hold the calculations.(CVE-2024-42223)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nwifi: mt76: replace skb_put with skb_put_zero\r\n\r\nAvoid potentially reusing uninitialized data(CVE-2024-42225)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\ncrypto: aead,cipher - zeroize key buffer after use\r\n\r\nI.G 9.7.B for FIPS 140-3 specifies that variables temporarily holding\ncryptographic information should be zeroized once they are no longer\nneeded.
