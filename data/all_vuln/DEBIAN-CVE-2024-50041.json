{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-50041","published":"2024-10-21T20:15:17Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:19:43.629521Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-50041"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i40e: Fix macvlan leak by synchronizing access to mac_filter_hash  This patch addresses a macvlan leak issue in the i40e driver caused by concurrent access to vsi->mac_filter_hash. The leak occurs when multiple threads attempt to modify the mac_filter_hash simultaneously, leading to inconsistent state and potential memory leaks.  To fix this, we now wrap the calls to i40e_del_mac_filter() and zeroing vf->default_lan_addr.addr with spin_lock/unlock_bh(&vsi->mac_filter_hash_lock), ensuring atomic operations and preventing concurrent access.  Additionally, we add lockdep_assert_held(&vsi->mac_filter_hash_lock) in i40e_add_mac_filter() to help catch similar issues in the future.  Reproduction steps: 1. Spawn VFs and configure port vlan on them. 2. Trigger concurrent macvlan operations (e.g., adding and deleting \tportvlan and/or mac filters). 3. Observe the potential memory leak and inconsistent state in the \tmac_filter_hash.  This synchronization ensures the integrity of the mac_filter_hash and prevents the described leak.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.115-1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.106-1","6.1.106-2","6.1.106-3","6.1.112-1","6.1.27-1","6.1.37-1","6.1.38-1","6.1.38-2","6.1.38-2~bpo11+1","6.1.38-3","6.1.38-4","6.1.38-4~bpo11+1","6.1.52-1","6.1.55-1","6.1.55-1~bpo11+1","6.1.64-1","6.1.66-1","6.1.67-1","6.1.69-1","6.1.69-1~bpo11+1","6.1.76-1","6.1.76-1~bpo11+1","6.1.82-1","6.1.85-1","6.1.90-1","6.1.90-1~bpo11+1","6.1.94-1","6.1.94-1~bpo11+1","6.1.98-1","6.1.99-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-50041.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.11.4-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-50041.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.11.4-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-50041.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux-6.1","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-6.1?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.119-1~deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.106-3~deb11u1","6.1.106-3~deb11u2","6.1.106-3~deb11u3","6.1.112-1~deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-50041.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-50041"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
