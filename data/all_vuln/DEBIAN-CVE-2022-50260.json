  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm: Make .remove and .shutdown HW shutdown consistent  Drivers' .remove and .shutdown callbacks are executed on different code paths. The former is called when a device is removed from the bus, while the latter is called at system shutdown time to quiesce the device.  This means that some overlap exists between the two, because both have to take care of properly shutting down the hardware. But currently the logic used in these two callbacks isn't consistent in msm drivers, which could lead to kernel panic.  For example, on .remove the component is deleted and its .unbind callback leads to the hardware being shutdown but only if the DRM device has been marked as registered.  That check doesn't exist in the .shutdown logic and this can lead to the driver calling drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() for a DRM device that hasn't been properly initialized.  A situation like this can happen if drivers for expected sub-devices fail to probe, since the .bind callback will never be executed. If that is the case, drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() will attempt to take mutexes that are only initialized if drm_mode_config_init() is called during a device bind.  This bug was attempted to be fixed in commit 623f279c7781 (\"drm/msm: fix shutdown hook in case GPU components failed to bind\"), but unfortunately it still happens in some cases as the one mentioned above, i.e:    systemd-shutdown[1]: Powering off.   kvm: exiting hardware virtualization   platform wifi-firmware.0: Removing from iommu group 12   platform video-firmware.0: Removing from iommu group 10   ------------[ cut here ]------------   WARNING: CPU: 6 PID: 1 at drivers/gpu/drm/drm_modeset_lock.c:317 drm_modeset_lock_all_ctx+0x3c4/0x3d0   ...
