(CVE-2020-26217)\n\nIt was discovered that XStream was vulnerable to server-side forgery attacks.\nA remote attacker could request data from internal resources that are not\npublicly available only by manipulating the processed input stream.\n(CVE-2020-26258)\n\nIt was discovered that XStream was vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion on\nthe local host. A remote attacker could use this to delete arbitrary known\nfiles on the host as long as the executing process had sufficient rights only\nby manipulating the processed input stream.
