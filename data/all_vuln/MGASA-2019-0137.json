  "details": "The printDefineFont2 function (util/listfdb.c) in libming through 0.4.8 is\nvulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, which may allow attackers to\ncause a denial of service or unspecified other impact via a crafted FDB\nfile. (CVE-2018-6358)\n\nThere is a heap-based buffer overflow in the getString function of\nutil/decompile.c in libming 0.4.8 during a RegisterNumber sprintf. A\nCrafted input will lead to a denial of service attack. (CVE-2018-7867)\n\nThere is a heap-based buffer over-read in the getName function of\nutil/decompile.c in libming 0.4.8 for CONSTANT8 data. A Crafted input will\nlead to a denial of service attack. (CVE-2018-7868)\n\nAn invalid memory address dereference was discovered in getString in\nutil/decompile.c in libming 0.4.8 for CONSTANT16 data. The vulnerability\ncauses a segmentation fault and application crash, which leads to denial\nof service.
