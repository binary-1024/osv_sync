This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads.","references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2271999"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-31082"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2024-April/003497.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/13"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/12/10"}]}
