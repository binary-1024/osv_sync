This has a been a benign bug because sendpage_ok() always returned true. With the recent slab allocator changes being slowly introduced into next (that disallow sendpage on large kmalloc allocations), we have recently hit out-of-bounds crashes, due to slight differences in iov_iter behavior between the MSG_SPLICE_PAGES and \"regular\" copy paths:  (MSG_SPLICE_PAGES) skb_splice_from_iter   iov_iter_extract_pages     iov_iter_extract_bvec_pages       uses i->nr_segs to correctly stop in its tracks before OoB'ing everywhere   skb_splice_from_iter gets a \"short\" read  (!MSG_SPLICE_PAGES) skb_copy_to_page_nocache copy=iov_iter_count  [...]    copy_from_iter         /* this doesn't help */         if (unlikely(iter->count < len))                 len = iter->count;           iterate_bvec             ... and we run off the bvecs  Fix this by properly setting the iov_iter's byte count, plus sending the correct byte count to tcp_sendmsg_locked.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.43-1"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-39758.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.16.3-1"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-39758.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-39758"}]}
