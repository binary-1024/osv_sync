This package is intended to be used by **any** project that needs these files. It intentionally does **not** provide any extra code except some metadata **nor** has any extra requirements. You MAY use some minimal support code from the XStatic base package, if you like. You can find more info about the xstatic packaging way in the package `XStatic`.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\njQuery-UI is the official jQuery user interface library. Prior to version 1.13.0, accepting the value of various `*Text` options of the Datepicker widget from untrusted sources may execute untrusted code. The issue is fixed in jQuery UI 1.13.0. The values passed to various `*Text` options are now always treated as pure text, not HTML. A workaround is to not accept the value of the `*Text` options from untrusted sources.(CVE-2021-41183)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-XStatic-jquery-ui","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python-XStatic-jquery-ui&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.12.1.1-2.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"noarch":["python3-XStatic-jquery-ui-1.12.1.1-2.oe1.noarch.rpm","python-XStatic-jquery-ui-help-1.12.1.1-2.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["python-XStatic-jquery-ui-1.12.1.1-2.oe1.src.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1693.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2022-1693"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41183"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
