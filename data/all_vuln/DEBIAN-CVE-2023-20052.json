An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted DMG file to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to leak bytes from any file that may be read by the ClamAV scanning process.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"clamav","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/clamav?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.103.8+dfsg-0+deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["0.103.2+dfsg-2","0.103.3+dfsg-0+deb11u1","0.103.3+dfsg-1","0.103.4+dfsg-0+deb11u1","0.103.4+dfsg-1","0.103.5+dfsg-0+deb11u1","0.103.5+dfsg-1","0.103.6+dfsg-0+deb11u1","0.103.6+dfsg-1","0.103.7+dfsg-0+deb11u1","0.103.7+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-20052.json"}},{"package":{"name":"clamav","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/clamav?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.1+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-20052.json"}},{"package":{"name":"clamav","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/clamav?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.1+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-20052.json"}},{"package":{"name":"clamav","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/clamav?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.1+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-20052.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-20052"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
