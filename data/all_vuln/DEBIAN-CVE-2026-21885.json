Prior to version 2.2.16, Miniflux's media proxy endpoint (`GET /proxy/{encodedDigest}/{encodedURL}`) can be abused to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). An authenticated user can cause Miniflux to generate a signed proxy URL for attacker-chosen media URLs embedded in feed entry content, including internal addresses (e.g., localhost, private RFC1918 ranges, or link-local metadata endpoints). Requesting the resulting `/proxy/...` URL makes Miniflux fetch and return the internal response. Version 2.2.16 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"miniflux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/miniflux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.2.10-1","2.2.11-1","2.2.12-1","2.2.13-1","2.2.16-1","2.2.16-2","2.2.6-1","2.2.6-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-21885.json"}},{"package":{"name":"miniflux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/miniflux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.2.16-1"}]}],"versions":["2.2.10-1","2.2.11-1","2.2.12-1","2.2.13-1","2.2.6-1","2.2.6-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-21885.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2026-21885"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
