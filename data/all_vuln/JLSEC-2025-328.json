Prior to version 1.6.51, a heap buffer over-read vulnerability exists in libpng's png_do_quantize function when processing PNG files with malformed palette indices. The vulnerability occurs when palette_lookup array bounds are not validated against externally-supplied image data, allowing an attacker to craft a PNG file with out-of-range palette indices that trigger out-of-bounds memory access. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.51.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libpng_jll","ecosystem":"Julia","purl":"pkg:julia/libpng_jll?uuid=b53b4c65-9356-5827-b1ea-8c7a1a84506f"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.6.51+0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/SecurityAdvisories.jl/tree/generated/osv/2025/JLSEC-2025-328.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/commit/6a528eb5fd0dd7f6de1c39d30de0e41473431c37"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/pull/748"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/security/advisories/GHSA-4952-h5wq-4m42"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC-BY-4.0","sources":[{"html_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64505","id":"CVE-2025-64505","imported":"2025-11-27T03:28:04.911Z","modified":"2025-11-26T18:28:32.220Z","published":"2025-11-25T00:15:47.133Z","url":"https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2025-64505"}]}}
