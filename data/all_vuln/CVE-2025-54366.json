In versions 1.8.185 and below, there is a critical deserialization vulnerability in the /conversation/ajax endpoint that allows authenticated users with knowledge of the APP_KEY to achieve remote code execution. The vulnerability occurs when the application processes the attachments_all and attachments POST parameters through the insecure Helper::decrypt() function, which performs unsafe deserialization of user-controlled data without proper validation. This flaw enables attackers to create arbitrary objects and manipulate their properties, leading to complete compromise of the web application. This is fixed in version 1.8.186.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/freescout-help-desk/freescout","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9669c57f1ddbee896752d9e16270abfd97b20eb9"}]}],"versions":["1.7.29"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54366.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/freescout-help-desk/freescout/security/advisories/GHSA-vcc2-6r66-gvvj"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/freescout-help-desk/freescout/commit/9669c57f1ddbee896752d9e16270abfd97b20eb9"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-502"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
