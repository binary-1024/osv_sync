{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-26761","published":"2024-04-03T17:15:52Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:18:14.608591Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-26761"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cxl/pci: Fix disabling memory if DVSEC CXL Range does not match a CFMWS window  The Linux CXL subsystem is built on the assumption that HPA == SPA. That is, the host physical address (HPA) the HDM decoder registers are programmed with are system physical addresses (SPA).  During HDM decoder setup, the DVSEC CXL range registers (cxl-3.1, 8.1.3.8) are checked if the memory is enabled and the CXL range is in a HPA window that is described in a CFMWS structure of the CXL host bridge (cxl-3.1, 9.18.1.3).  Now, if the HPA is not an SPA, the CXL range does not match a CFMWS window and the CXL memory range will be disabled then. The HDM decoder stops working which causes system memory being disabled and further a system hang during HDM decoder initialization, typically when a CXL enabled kernel boots.  Prevent a system hang and do not disable the HDM decoder if the decoder's CXL range is not found in a CFMWS window.  Note the change only fixes a hardware hang, but does not implement HPA/SPA translation. Support for this can be added in a follow on patch series.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.82-1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.27-1","6.1.37-1","6.1.38-1","6.1.38-2","6.1.38-2~bpo11+1","6.1.38-3","6.1.38-4","6.1.38-4~bpo11+1","6.1.52-1","6.1.55-1","6.1.55-1~bpo11+1","6.1.64-1","6.1.66-1","6.1.67-1","6.1.69-1","6.1.69-1~bpo11+1","6.1.76-1","6.1.76-1~bpo11+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-26761.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.7.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-26761.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.7.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-26761.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-26761"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
