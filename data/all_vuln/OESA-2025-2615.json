Applications using this library can do anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by installing new plugins.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nGStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. The function qtdemux_parse_sbgp in qtdemux.c is affected by a null dereference vulnerability. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.(CVE-2024-47544)\n\nGStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An integer underflow has been detected in qtdemux_parse_trak function within qtdemux.c. During the strf parsing case, the subtraction size -= 40 can lead to a negative integer overflow if it is less than 40. If this happens, the subsequent call to gst_buffer_fill will invoke memcpy with a large tocopy size, resulting in an OOB-read.
