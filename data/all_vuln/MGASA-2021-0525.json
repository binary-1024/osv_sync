  "details": "In NetKit through 0.17, rcp.c in the rcp client allows remote rsh servers\nto bypass intended access restrictions via the filename of . or an empty\nfilename. The impact is modifying the permissions of the target directory\non the client side. This is similar to CVE-2018-20685. (CVE-2019-7282)\n\nAn issue was discovered in rcp in NetKit through 0.17. For an rcp\noperation, the server chooses which files/directories are sent to the\nclient. However, the rcp client only performs cursory validation of the\nobject name returned. A malicious rsh server (or Man-in-The-Middle\nattacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in a directory on the rcp client\nmachine. This is similar to CVE-2019-6111. (CVE-2019-7283).\n",
