  "details": "An authenticated user could create a stack-based buffer overflow by\nchanging their own password to a purpose-crafted value. In addition to\nthe ability to crash the PostgreSQL server, this could be further\nexploited to execute arbitrary code as the PostgreSQL operating system\naccount.\n\nAdditionally, a rogue server could send a specifically crafted message\nduring the SCRAM authentication process and cause a libpq-enabled client\nto either crash or execute arbitrary code as the client's operating\nsystem account. (CVE-2019-10164)\n\nMore than 25 other bugs have been fixed too, see referenced release\nnotes.\n",
