This impacts the function bfd_elf_gc_record_vtentry of the file bfd/elflink.c of the component Linker. The manipulation leads to out-of-bounds read. Local access is required to approach this attack. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier of the patch is 047435dd988a3975d40c6626a8f739a0b2e154bc. To fix this issue, it is recommended to deploy a patch.(CVE-2025-11412)\n\nA weakness has been identified in GNU Binutils 2.45. The affected element is the function vfinfo of the file ldmisc.c. Executing manipulation can lead to out-of-bounds read. The attack can only be executed locally. The exploit has been made available to the public and could be exploited. This patch is called 16357.
