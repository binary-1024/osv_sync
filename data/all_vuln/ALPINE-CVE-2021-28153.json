When g_file_replace() is used with G_FILE_CREATE_REPLACE_DESTINATION to replace a path that is a dangling symlink, it incorrectly also creates the target of the symlink as an empty file, which could conceivably have security relevance if the symlink is attacker-controlled. (If the path is a symlink to a file that already exists, then the contents of that file correctly remain unchanged.)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"glib","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/glib?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.66.6-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.18.3-r0","2.18.4-r0","2.20.0-r0","2.20.3-r0","2.20.4-r0","2.20.4-r1","2.20.4-r2","2.20.5-r0","2.22.2-r0","2.22.4-r0","2.24.0-r0","2.24.0-r1","2.24.0-r2","2.24.0-r3","2.24.0-r4","2.24.2-r0","2.24.2-r1","2.25.17-r0","2.26.0-r0","2.26.0-r1","2.26.0-r2","2.27.92-r0","2.27.93-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.0-r1","2.28.8-r0","2.30.0-r0","2.30.0-r1","2.32.1-r0","2.32.1-r1","2.32.4-r0","2.34.0-r0","2.34.0-r1","2.34.0-r2","2.34.2-r0","2.34.3-r0","2.36.0-r0","2.36.1-r0","2.36.4-r0","2.38.0-r0","2.38.1-r0","2.38.1-r1","2.38.2-r0","2.40.0-r0","2.40.0-r1","2.42.0-r0","2.44.0-r0","2.44.0-r1","2.44.1-r0","2.44.1-r1","2.46.0-r0","2.46.0-r1","2.46.2-r0","2.46.2-r1","2.48.0-r0","2.48.0-r1","2.48.1-r0","2.48.1-r1","2.48.1-r2","2.48.1-r3","2.48.2-r0","2.50.0-r0","2.50.2-r0","2.50.2-r1","2.50.3-r0","2.52.0-r0","2.52.1-r0","2.54.0-r0","2.54.1-r0","2.54.2-r0","2.56.0-r0","2.56.1-r0","2.58.1-r0","2.58.1-r1","2.58.1-r2","2.58.1-r3","2.60.4-r0","2.60.5-r0","2.60.6-r0","2.60.7-r0","2.62.0-r0","2.62.1-r0","2.62.2-r0","2.62.3-r0","2.62.4-r0","2.62.4-r1","2.62.5-r0","2.62.5-r1","2.64.0-r0","2.64.1-r0","2.64.2-r0","2.64.2-r1","2.64.2-r2","2.64.2-r3","2.64.3-r0","2.64.3-r1","2.64.4-r0","2.64.5-r0","2.66.0-r0","2.66.1-r0","2.66.2-r0","2.66.3-r0","2.66.4-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-28153.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2021-28153"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
