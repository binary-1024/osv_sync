It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++ (or other languages, depending on the chosen implementation). Python is also usable as an extension language for applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use scripting or automation interfaces.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nThe package python/cpython from 0 and before 3.6.13, from 3.7.0 and before 3.7.10, from 3.8.0 and before 3.8.8, from 3.9.0 and before 3.9.2 are vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning via urllib.parse.parse_qsl and urllib.parse.parse_qs by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.(CVE-2021-23336)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python3&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.9-10.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python3-debug-3.7.9-8.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-devel-3.7.9-8.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.7.9-8.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-3.7.9-8.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.7.9-8.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-3.7.9-10.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-debug-3.7.9-10.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.7.9-10.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-devel-3.7.9-10.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.7.9-10.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["python3-help-3.7.9-8.oe1.noarch.rpm","python3-help-3.7.9-10.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["python3-3.7.9-8.oe1.src.rpm","python3-3.7.9-10.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python3-3.7.9-8.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.7.9-8.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-debug-3.7.9-8.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.7.9-8.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-devel-3.7.9-8.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.7.9-10.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-3.7.9-10.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.7.9-10.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-debug-3.7.9-10.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-devel-3.7.9-10.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1125.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python3&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.9-10.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python3-3.7.9-10.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-debug-3.7.9-10.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.7.9-10.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-devel-3.7.9-10.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.7.9-10.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["python3-help-3.7.9-10.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["python3-3.7.9-10.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python3-debugsource-3.7.9-10.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-3.7.9-10.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.7.9-10.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-debug-3.7.9-10.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-devel-3.7.9-10.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1125.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1125"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23336"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
