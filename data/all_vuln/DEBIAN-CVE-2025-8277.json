The library fails to free memory during these rekey operations, which can gradually exhaust system memory. This issue can lead to crashes on the client side, particularly when using libgcrypt, which impacts application stability and availability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libssh?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.9.8-0+deb11u2"}]}],"versions":["0.9.5-1","0.9.5-1+deb11u1","0.9.6-1","0.9.6-2","0.9.7-0+deb11u1","0.9.8-0+deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-8277.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libssh?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.10.6-0+deb12u2"}]}],"versions":["0.10.5-2","0.10.5-3","0.10.5-3+hurd.1","0.10.6-0+deb12u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-8277.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libssh?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.11.2-1+deb13u1"}]}],"versions":["0.11.2-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-8277.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libssh?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.11.3-1"}]}],"versions":["0.11.2-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-8277.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-8277"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
