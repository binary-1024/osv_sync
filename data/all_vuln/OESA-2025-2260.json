This occurs when possibly dangerous VCS configuration is present in repositories. This can happen when a repository was fetched via one VCS (e.g. Git), but contains metadata for another VCS (e.g. Mercurial). Modules which are retrieved using the go command line, i.e. via &apos;go get&apos;, are not affected.(CVE-2025-4674)\n\nA vulnerability was found in Google Go up to 1.23.11/1.24.5 (Programming Language Software). It has been declared as problematic.The manipulation of the argument PATH with an unknown input leads to a unknown weakness.As an impact it is known to affect integrity.Upgrading to version 1.23.12 or 1.24.6 eliminates this vulnerability.(CVE-2025-47906)\n\nCancelling a query (e.g. by cancelling the context passed to one of the query methods) during a call to the Scan method of the returned Rows can result in unexpected results if other queries are being made in parallel. This can result in a race condition that may overwrite the expected results with those of another query, causing the call to Scan to return either unexpected results from the other query or an error.(CVE-2025-47907)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"golang","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/golang&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.21.4-35.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["golang-1.21.4-35.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["golang-devel-1.21.4-35.oe2403.noarch.rpm","golang-help-1.21.4-35.oe2403.noarch.rpm"],"src":["golang-1.21.4-35.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["golang-1.21.4-35.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2260.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2260"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4674"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47906"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47907"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
