ARM never properly implemented grant table v2, either in the hypervisor or in Linux. Unfortunately, an ARM guest can still request v2 grant tables; they will simply not be properly set up, resulting in subsequent grant-related hypercalls hitting BUG() checks. An unprivileged guest can cause a BUG() check in the hypervisor, resulting in a denial-of-service (crash).","references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-268.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/11/msg00013.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201810-06"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
