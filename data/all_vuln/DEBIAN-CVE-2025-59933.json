For versions 8.17.1 and below, when libvips is compiled with support for PDF input via poppler, the pdfload operation is affected by a buffer read overflow when parsing the header of a crafted PDF with a page that defines a width but not a height. Those using libvips compiled without support for PDF input are unaffected as well as thosewith support for PDF input via PDFium. This issue is fixed in version 8.17.2. A workaround for those affected is to block the VipsForeignLoadPdf operation via vips_operation_block_set, which is available in most language bindings, or to set VIPS_BLOCK_UNTRUSTED environment variable at runtime, which will block all untrusted loaders including PDF input via poppler.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"vips","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/vips?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["8.10.5-2","8.10.5-2+deb11u1","8.11.4-1","8.11.4-2","8.12.1-1","8.12.2-1","8.13.0-1","8.13.1-1","8.13.2-1","8.13.3-1","8.13.3-2","8.14.1-1","8.14.1-2","8.14.1-3","8.14.2-1","8.14.3-1","8.14.4-1","8.14.5-1","8.15.0-1","8.15.0-2","8.15.0~rc2-1","8.15.0~rc2-2","8.15.1-1","8.15.1-1.1","8.15.1-1.1~exp1","8.15.2-1","8.15.2-2","8.15.3-1","8.16.0-1","8.16.0-2","8.16.1-1","8.16.1-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-59933.json"}},{"package":{"name":"vips","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/vips?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["8.14.1-3","8.14.1-3+deb12u1","8.14.1-3+deb12u2","8.14.2-1","8.14.3-1","8.14.4-1","8.14.5-1","8.15.0-1","8.15.0-2","8.15.0~rc2-1","8.15.0~rc2-2","8.15.1-1","8.15.1-1.1","8.15.1-1.1~exp1","8.15.2-1","8.15.2-2","8.15.3-1","8.16.0-1","8.16.0-2","8.16.1-1","8.16.1-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-59933.json"}},{"package":{"name":"vips","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/vips?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["8.16.1-1","8.16.1-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-59933.json"}},{"package":{"name":"vips","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/vips?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["8.16.1-1","8.16.1-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-59933.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-59933"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
