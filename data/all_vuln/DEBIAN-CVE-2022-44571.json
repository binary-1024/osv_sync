This could allow an attacker to craft an input that can cause Content-Disposition header parsing in Rackto take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a denial ofservice attack vector. This header is used typically used in multipartparsing. Any applications that parse multipart posts using Rack (virtuallyall Rails applications) are impacted.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ruby-rack","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ruby-rack?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.1.4-3+deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["2.1.4-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-44571.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ruby-rack","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ruby-rack?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.2.4-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-44571.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ruby-rack","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ruby-rack?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.2.4-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-44571.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ruby-rack","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ruby-rack?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.2.4-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-44571.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-44571"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
