This flaw allows an attacker to trick the user into submitting a request that could perform actions as the user, resulting in a loss of confidentiality and system integrity. During community penetration testing it was found that for certain HTTP end-points FreeIPA does not ensure CSRF protection. Due to implementation details one cannot use this flaw for reflection of a cookie representing already logged-in user. An attacker would always have to go through a new authentication attempt.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"freeipa","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/freeipa?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.10.1+dfsg1-1+exp1","4.10.1-1+exp1","4.10.2-1","4.10.2-2","4.10.2-2+exp1","4.11.1-1","4.11.1-1+exp1","4.11.1-2","4.11.1-2+exp1","4.11.1-2.1","4.12.2-1","4.12.2-2","4.12.2-3","4.12.4-1","4.12.4-2","4.9.11-1","4.9.11-1+exp1","4.9.11-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-5455.json"}},{"package":{"name":"freeipa","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/freeipa?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.11.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-5455.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-5455"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
