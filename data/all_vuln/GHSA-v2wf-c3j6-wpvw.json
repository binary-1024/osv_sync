Cookie store, which is used in most Phoenix apps, doesn't have this vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nCall `Plug.Conn.configure_session(conn, renew: true)` periodically and after privilege change. A custom authorization plug can be written where the `create/3` method should return the `conn` only after `Plug.Conn.configure_session/2` have been called on it.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/danschultzer/pow/commit/578ffd3d8bb8e8a26077b644222186b108da474f  \nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_fixation","affected":[{"package":{"name":"pow","ecosystem":"Hex","purl":"pkg:hex/pow"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.16"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0-alpha","0.1.0-alpha.1","0.1.0-alpha.2","0.1.0-alpha.3","0.1.0-alpha.4","0.1.0-alpha.5","0.1.0-alpha.6","0.1.0-alpha.7","0.1.0-alpha.8","0.1.0-rc.1","1.0.0","1.0.0-rc.0","1.0.0-rc.1","1.0.0-rc.2","1.0.0-rc.3","1.0.0-rc.4","1.0.1","1.0.10","1.0.11","1.0.12","1.0.13","1.0.14","1.0.15","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.0.7","1.0.8","1.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/04/GHSA-v2wf-c3j6-wpvw/GHSA-v2wf-c3j6-wpvw.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/danschultzer/pow/security/advisories/GHSA-v2wf-c3j6-wpvw"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5205"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/danschultzer/pow/commit/578ffd3d8bb8e8a26077b644222186b108da474f"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/danschultzer/pow"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/danschultzer/pow/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v1016-2020-01-07"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-384"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-04-12T21:27:49Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N"}]}
