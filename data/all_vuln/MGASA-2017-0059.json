  "details": "Updated Iceape packages derived from Seamonkey include security fixes from\nMozilla Firefox:\n\nHeap-based buffer overflow in the\nnsCaseTransformTextRunFactory::TransformString function in Seamonkey\nbefore 2.46 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (boolean\nout-of-bounds write) or possibly have unspecified other impact via Unicode\ncharacters that are mishandled during text conversion. (CVE-2016-5270)\n\nThe PropertyProvider::GetSpacingInternal function in Seamonkey before 2.46\nallows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read\nand application crash) via text runs in conjunction with a\n\"display: contents\" Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) property. (CVE-2016-5271)\n\nThe nsImageGeometryMixin class in Seamonkey before 2.46 does not properly\nperform a cast of an unspecified variable during handling of INPUT\nelements, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a\ncrafted web site. (CVE-2016-5272)\n\nUse-after-free vulnerability in the\nmozilla::a11y::DocAccessible::ProcessInvalidationList function in\nSeamonkey before 2.46 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code\nor cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) via an aria-owns\nattribute. (CVE-2016-5276)\n\nUse-after-free vulnerability in the nsFrameManager::CaptureFrameState\nfunction in Seamonkey before 2.46 allows remote attackers to execute\narbitrary code by leveraging improper interaction between restyling and\nthe Web Animations model implementation. (CVE-2016-5274)\n\nUse-after-free vulnerability in the nsRefreshDriver::Tick function in\nSeamonkey before 2.46 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or\ncause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) by leveraging improper\ninteraction between timeline destruction and the Web Animations model\nimplementation. (CVE-2016-5277)\n\nHeap-based buffer overflow in the nsBMPEncoder::AddImageFrame function in\nSeamonkey before 2.46 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code\nvia a crafted image data that is mishandled during the encoding of an\nimage frame to an image. (CVE-2016-5278)\n\nUse-after-free vulnerability in the\nmozilla::nsTextNodeDirectionalityMap::RemoveElementFromMap function in\nSeamonkey before 2.46 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code\nvia bidirectional text. (CVE-2016-5280)\n\nUse-after-free vulnerability in the DOMSVGLength class in Seamonkey before\n2.46 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging\nimproper interaction between JavaScript code and an SVG document.\n(CVE-2016-5281)\n\nSeamonkey before 2.46 relies on unintended expiration dates for Preloaded\nPublic Key Pinning, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof\nadd-on updates by leveraging possession of an X.509 server certificate for\naddons.mozilla.org signed by an arbitrary built-in Certification\nAuthority. (CVE-2016-5284)\n\nMultiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine in Seamonkey\nbefore 2.46 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory\ncorruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via\nunknown vectors.
