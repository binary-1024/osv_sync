GLib&amp;apos;s code was separated from GTK, so it can be used by software other than GNOME and has been developed in parallel ever since.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability was found in GNOME GLib (the affected version unknown). It has been declared as critical. The CWE definition for the vulnerability is CWE-120. The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. As an impact it is known to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability. There is no information about possible countermeasures known. It may be suggested to replace the affected object with an alternative product.(CVE-2025-14087)\n\nA flaw was found in glib. This vulnerability allows a heap buffer overflow and denial-of-service (DoS) via an integer overflow in GLib&apos;s GIO (GLib Input/Output) escape_byte_string() function when processing malicious file or remote filesystem attribute values.(CVE-2025-14512)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"glib2","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/glib2&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.72.2-24.oe2203sp3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["glib2-2.72.2-24.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","glib2-debuginfo-2.72.2-24.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","glib2-debugsource-2.72.2-24.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","glib2-devel-2.72.2-24.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","glib2-static-2.72.2-24.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","glib2-tests-2.72.2-24.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["glib2-help-2.72.2-24.oe2203sp3.noarch.rpm"],"src":["glib2-2.72.2-24.oe2203sp3.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["glib2-2.72.2-24.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","glib2-debuginfo-2.72.2-24.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","glib2-debugsource-2.72.2-24.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","glib2-devel-2.72.2-24.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","glib2-static-2.72.2-24.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","glib2-tests-2.72.2-24.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2900.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2900"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-14087"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-14512"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
