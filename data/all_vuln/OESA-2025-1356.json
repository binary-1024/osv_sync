These file systems could be a local disk, an HTTP server or a ZIP archive file. The key features are listed as follows: * The API is consistent among various file types. * Support for a wide range of file systems. * Support caching local file system with different fs types. * Event delivery. * Provides in-JVM info caching. * A set of Ant tasks which VFS is enabled. * Easy to be intergrated into applications such as VFS-aware ClassLoader and URLStreamHandlerFactory.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nRelative Path Traversal vulnerability in Apache Commons VFS before 2.10.0.\n\nThe FileObject API in Commons VFS has a &apos;resolveFile&apos; method that\ntakes a &apos;scope&apos; parameter. Specifying &apos;NameScope.DESCENDENT&apos; promises that &quot;an exception is thrown if the resolved file is not a descendent of\nthe base file&quot;. However, when the path contains encoded &quot;..&quot;\ncharacters (for example, &quot;%2E%2E/bar.txt&quot;), it might return file objects that are not\na descendent of the base file, without throwing an exception.\nThis issue affects Apache Commons VFS: before 2.10.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.10.0, which fixes the issue.(CVE-2025-27553)\n\nExposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache Commons VFS.\n\nThe FtpFileObject class can throw an exception when a file is not found, revealing the original URI in its message, which may include a password. The fix is to mask the password in the exception message\nThis issue affects Apache Commons VFS: before 2.10.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.10.0, which fixes the issue.(CVE-2025-30474)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"apache-commons-vfs","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/apache-commons-vfs&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.10.0-1.oe2403sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"noarch":["apache-commons-vfs-2.10.0-1.oe2403sp1.noarch.rpm","apache-commons-vfs-devel-2.10.0-1.oe2403sp1.noarch.rpm","apache-commons-vfs-help-2.10.0-1.oe2403sp1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["apache-commons-vfs-2.10.0-1.oe2403sp1.src.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1356.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-1356"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27553"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30474"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
