  "details": "Commons VFS provides a uniform view of files through a single API which is designed for accessing various different file systems. These file systems could be a local disk, an HTTP server or a ZIP archive file. The key features are listed as follows: * The API is consistent among various file types. * Support for a wide range of file systems. * Support caching local file system with different fs types. * Event delivery. * Provides in-JVM info caching. * A set of Ant tasks which VFS is enabled. * Easy to be intergrated into applications such as VFS-aware ClassLoader and URLStreamHandlerFactory.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nRelative Path Traversal vulnerability in Apache Commons VFS before 2.10.0.\n\nThe FileObject API in Commons VFS has a &apos;resolveFile&apos; method that\ntakes a &apos;scope&apos; parameter. Specifying &apos;NameScope.DESCENDENT&apos; promises that &quot;an exception is thrown if the resolved file is not a descendent of\nthe base file&quot;. However, when the path contains encoded &quot;..&quot;\ncharacters (for example, &quot;%2E%2E/bar.txt&quot;), it might return file objects that are not\na descendent of the base file, without throwing an exception.\nThis issue affects Apache Commons VFS: before 2.10.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.10.0, which fixes the issue.(CVE-2025-27553)\n\nExposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache Commons VFS.\n\nThe FtpFileObject class can throw an exception when a file is not found, revealing the original URI in its message, which may include a password. The fix is to mask the password in the exception message\nThis issue affects Apache Commons VFS: before 2.10.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.10.0, which fixes the issue.(CVE-2025-30474)",
