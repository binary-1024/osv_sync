In other words, dnspython does not have the preferred behavior in which the DNS name resolution algorithm would proceed, within the full time window, in order to wait for a valid packet. NOTE: dnspython 2.6.0 is unusable for a different reason that was addressed in 2.6.1.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"dnspython","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dnspython?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-1","2.1.0-1","2.2.0-1","2.2.0-2","2.2.0~rc1-1","2.2.1-1","2.2.1-2","2.3.0-1","2.3.0~rc1-1","2.4.0-1","2.4.0~rc1-1","2.4.1-1","2.4.2-1","2.5.0-1","2.5.0~rc1-1","2.6.0-1","2.6.0~rc1-1","2.6.1-1","2.7.0-1","2.7.0~rc1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-29483.json"}},{"package":{"name":"dnspython","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dnspython?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.3.0-1","2.4.0-1","2.4.0~rc1-1","2.4.1-1","2.4.2-1","2.5.0-1","2.5.0~rc1-1","2.6.0-1","2.6.0~rc1-1","2.6.1-1","2.7.0-1","2.7.0~rc1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-29483.json"}},{"package":{"name":"dnspython","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dnspython?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.6.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-29483.json"}},{"package":{"name":"dnspython","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dnspython?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.6.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-29483.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-29483"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H"}]}
