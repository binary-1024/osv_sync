The function get_net_ns_by_id() in net/core/net_namespace.c does not check for the net::count value after it has found a peer network in netns_ids idr, which could lead to double free and memory corruption. This vulnerability could allow an unprivileged local user to induce kernel memory corruption on the system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although it is thought to be unlikely.","references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2018/q1/7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0654"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0676"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1062"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1946"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-15129"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1531174"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=151370451121029&w=2"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://marc.info/?t=151370468900001&r=1&w=2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3617-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3617-2/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3617-3/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3619-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3619-2/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3632-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.14.11"},{"type":"FIX","url":"http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=21b5944350052d2583e82dd59b19a9ba94a007f0"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/21b5944350052d2583e82dd59b19a9ba94a007f0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102485"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
