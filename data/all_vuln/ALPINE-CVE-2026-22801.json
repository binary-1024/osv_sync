From 1.6.26 to 1.6.53, there is an integer truncation in the libpng simplified write API functions png_write_image_16bit and png_write_image_8bit causes heap buffer over-read when the caller provides a negative row stride (for bottom-up image layouts) or a stride exceeding 65535 bytes. The bug was introduced in libpng 1.6.26 (October 2016) by casts added to silence compiler warnings on 16-bit systems. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.6.54.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libpng","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libpng?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.6.54-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.34-r0","1.2.35-r0","1.2.36-r0","1.2.37-r0","1.2.38-r0","1.2.39-r0","1.2.40-r0","1.4.0-r0","1.4.1-r0","1.4.1-r1","1.4.2-r0","1.4.3-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.5.10-r0","1.5.11-r0","1.5.12-r0","1.5.13-r0","1.5.14-r0","1.5.15-r0","1.5.16-r0","1.5.17-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.2-r1","1.5.2-r2","1.5.4-r0","1.5.5-r0","1.5.5-r1","1.5.8-r0","1.5.9-r0","1.6.10-r0","1.6.12-r0","1.6.13-r0","1.6.14-r0","1.6.15-r0","1.6.16-r0","1.6.17-r0","1.6.18-r0","1.6.19-r0","1.6.20-r0","1.6.21-r0","1.6.22-r0","1.6.23-r0","1.6.23-r1","1.6.23-r2","1.6.24-r0","1.6.25-r0","1.6.26-r0","1.6.27-r0","1.6.27-r1","1.6.28-r0","1.6.29-r0","1.6.29-r1","1.6.3-r0","1.6.30-r0","1.6.31-r0","1.6.32-r0","1.6.34-r0","1.6.34-r1","1.6.35-r0","1.6.37-r0","1.6.37-r1","1.6.37-r2","1.6.38-r0","1.6.39-r0","1.6.39-r1","1.6.39-r2","1.6.39-r3","1.6.39-r4","1.6.40-r0","1.6.41-r0","1.6.42-r0","1.6.43-r0","1.6.44-r0","1.6.5-r0","1.6.53-r0","1.6.6-r0","1.6.7-r0","1.6.8-r0","1.6.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2026-22801.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libpng","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libpng?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.6.54-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.34-r0","1.2.35-r0","1.2.36-r0","1.2.37-r0","1.2.38-r0","1.2.39-r0","1.2.40-r0","1.4.0-r0","1.4.1-r0","1.4.1-r1","1.4.2-r0","1.4.3-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.5.10-r0","1.5.11-r0","1.5.12-r0","1.5.13-r0","1.5.14-r0","1.5.15-r0","1.5.16-r0","1.5.17-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.2-r1","1.5.2-r2","1.5.4-r0","1.5.5-r0","1.5.5-r1","1.5.8-r0","1.5.9-r0","1.6.10-r0","1.6.12-r0","1.6.13-r0","1.6.14-r0","1.6.15-r0","1.6.16-r0","1.6.17-r0","1.6.18-r0","1.6.19-r0","1.6.20-r0","1.6.21-r0","1.6.22-r0","1.6.23-r0","1.6.23-r1","1.6.23-r2","1.6.24-r0","1.6.25-r0","1.6.26-r0","1.6.27-r0","1.6.27-r1","1.6.28-r0","1.6.29-r0","1.6.29-r1","1.6.3-r0","1.6.30-r0","1.6.31-r0","1.6.32-r0","1.6.34-r0","1.6.34-r1","1.6.35-r0","1.6.37-r0","1.6.37-r1","1.6.37-r2","1.6.38-r0","1.6.39-r0","1.6.39-r1","1.6.39-r2","1.6.39-r3","1.6.39-r4","1.6.40-r0","1.6.41-r0","1.6.42-r0","1.6.43-r0","1.6.44-r0","1.6.47-r0","1.6.5-r0","1.6.53-r0","1.6.6-r0","1.6.7-r0","1.6.8-r0","1.6.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2026-22801.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libpng","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libpng?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.6.54-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.34-r0","1.2.35-r0","1.2.36-r0","1.2.37-r0","1.2.38-r0","1.2.39-r0","1.2.40-r0","1.4.0-r0","1.4.1-r0","1.4.1-r1","1.4.2-r0","1.4.3-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.5.10-r0","1.5.11-r0","1.5.12-r0","1.5.13-r0","1.5.14-r0","1.5.15-r0","1.5.16-r0","1.5.17-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.2-r1","1.5.2-r2","1.5.4-r0","1.5.5-r0","1.5.5-r1","1.5.8-r0","1.5.9-r0","1.6.10-r0","1.6.12-r0","1.6.13-r0","1.6.14-r0","1.6.15-r0","1.6.16-r0","1.6.17-r0","1.6.18-r0","1.6.19-r0","1.6.20-r0","1.6.21-r0","1.6.22-r0","1.6.23-r0","1.6.23-r1","1.6.23-r2","1.6.24-r0","1.6.25-r0","1.6.26-r0","1.6.27-r0","1.6.27-r1","1.6.28-r0","1.6.29-r0","1.6.29-r1","1.6.3-r0","1.6.30-r0","1.6.31-r0","1.6.32-r0","1.6.34-r0","1.6.34-r1","1.6.35-r0","1.6.37-r0","1.6.37-r1","1.6.37-r2","1.6.38-r0","1.6.39-r0","1.6.39-r1","1.6.39-r2","1.6.39-r3","1.6.39-r4","1.6.40-r0","1.6.41-r0","1.6.42-r0","1.6.43-r0","1.6.44-r0","1.6.45-r0","1.6.46-r0","1.6.47-r0","1.6.5-r0","1.6.51-r0","1.6.53-r0","1.6.6-r0","1.6.7-r0","1.6.8-r0","1.6.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2026-22801.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libpng","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.23","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libpng?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.6.54-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.34-r0","1.2.35-r0","1.2.36-r0","1.2.37-r0","1.2.38-r0","1.2.39-r0","1.2.40-r0","1.4.0-r0","1.4.1-r0","1.4.1-r1","1.4.2-r0","1.4.3-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.5.10-r0","1.5.11-r0","1.5.12-r0","1.5.13-r0","1.5.14-r0","1.5.15-r0","1.5.16-r0","1.5.17-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.2-r1","1.5.2-r2","1.5.4-r0","1.5.5-r0","1.5.5-r1","1.5.8-r0","1.5.9-r0","1.6.10-r0","1.6.12-r0","1.6.13-r0","1.6.14-r0","1.6.15-r0","1.6.16-r0","1.6.17-r0","1.6.18-r0","1.6.19-r0","1.6.20-r0","1.6.21-r0","1.6.22-r0","1.6.23-r0","1.6.23-r1","1.6.23-r2","1.6.24-r0","1.6.25-r0","1.6.26-r0","1.6.27-r0","1.6.27-r1","1.6.28-r0","1.6.29-r0","1.6.29-r1","1.6.3-r0","1.6.30-r0","1.6.31-r0","1.6.32-r0","1.6.34-r0","1.6.34-r1","1.6.35-r0","1.6.37-r0","1.6.37-r1","1.6.37-r2","1.6.38-r0","1.6.39-r0","1.6.39-r1","1.6.39-r2","1.6.39-r3","1.6.39-r4","1.6.40-r0","1.6.41-r0","1.6.42-r0","1.6.43-r0","1.6.44-r0","1.6.45-r0","1.6.46-r0","1.6.47-r0","1.6.49-r0","
