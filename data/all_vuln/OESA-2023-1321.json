It supports dozens of protocol capture file formats and understands more than a thousand protocols. It has many powerful features including a rich display filter language and the ability to reassemble multiple protocol packets in order to, for example, view a complete TCP stream, save the contents of a file which was transferred over HTTP or CIFS, or play back an RTP audio stream.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nBLF file parser crash in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.5 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.13 allows denial of service via crafted capture file(CVE-2023-2857)\r\n\r\nNetScaler file parser crash in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.5 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.13 allows denial of service via crafted capture file(CVE-2023-2858)\r\n\r\nCandump log parser crash in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.5 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.13 allows denial of service via crafted capture file(CVE-2023-2855)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the IEEE C37.118 Synchrophasor dissector of Wireshark.
