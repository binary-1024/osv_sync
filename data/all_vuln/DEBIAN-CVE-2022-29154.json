The server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the rsync client performs insufficient validation of file names. A malicious rsync server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the rsync client target directory and subdirectories (for example, overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.2.3-4","3.2.3-4+deb11u1","3.2.3-4+deb11u2","3.2.3-4+deb11u3","3.2.3-5","3.2.3-6","3.2.3-7","3.2.3-8","3.2.4-1","3.2.4-1~bpo11+1","3.2.5-1","3.2.6-1","3.2.6-2","3.2.6-3","3.2.6-4","3.2.7-1","3.2.7-1~bpo11+1","3.3.0+ds1-1","3.3.0+ds1-2","3.3.0+ds1-3","3.3.0+ds1-4","3.3.0-1","3.4.1+ds1-1","3.4.1+ds1-2","3.4.1+ds1-3","3.4.1+ds1-4","3.4.1+ds1-4~exp1","3.4.1+ds1-4~exp2","3.4.1+ds1-5","3.4.1+ds1-5~exp1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-29154.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.2.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-29154.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.2.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-29154.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.2.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-29154.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-29154"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H"}]}
