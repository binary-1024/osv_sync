There is an integer overflow in the function handle_prism during caplen processing. If the caplen is less than 144, one can cause an integer overflow in the function handle_80211, which will result in an out-of-bounds read and may allow access to sensitive memory (or a denial of service).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"tcpflow","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tcpflow?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["0.21-r0","0.21-r1","0.21-r2","1.2.8-r0","1.2.8-r1","1.2.9-r0","1.3.0-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.4.5-r2","1.4.5-r3","1.4.5-r4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-14938.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tcpflow","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tcpflow?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["0.21-r0","0.21-r1","0.21-r2","1.2.8-r0","1.2.8-r1","1.2.9-r0","1.3.0-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.4.5-r2","1.4.5-r3","1.4.5-r4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-14938.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tcpflow","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tcpflow?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["0.21-r0","0.21-r1","0.21-r2","1.2.8-r0","1.2.8-r1","1.2.9-r0","1.3.0-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.4.5-r2","1.4.5-r3","1.4.5-r4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-14938.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tcpflow","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tcpflow?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["0.21-r0","0.21-r1","0.21-r2","1.2.8-r0","1.2.8-r1","1.2.9-r0","1.3.0-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.4.5-r2","1.4.5-r3","1.4.5-r4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-14938.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tcpflow","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tcpflow?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["0.21-r0","0.21-r1","0.21-r2","1.2.8-r0","1.2.8-r1","1.2.9-r0","1.3.0-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.4.5-r2","1.4.5-r3","1.4.5-r4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-14938.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tcpflow","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tcpflow?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["0.21-r0","0.21-r1","0.21-r2","1.2.8-r0","1.2.8-r1","1.2.9-r0","1.3.0-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.4.5-r2","1.4.5-r3","1.4.5-r4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-14938.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tcpflow","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tcpflow?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["0.21-r0","0.21-r1","0.21-r2","1.2.8-r0","1.2.8-r1","1.2.9-r0","1.3.0-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.4.5-r2","1.4.5-r3","1.4.5-r4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-14938.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tcpflow","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tcpflow?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["0.21-r0","0.21-r1","0.21-r2","1.2.8-r0","1.2.8-r1","1.2.9-r0","1.3.0-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.4.5-r2","1.4.5-r3","1.4.5-r4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-14938.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tcpflow","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tcpflow?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["0.21-r0","0.21-r1","0.21-r2","1.2.8-r0","1.2.8-r1","1.2.9-r0","1.3.0-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.4.5-r2","1.4.5-r3","1.4.5-r4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-14938.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tcpflow","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tcpflow?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["0.21-r0","0.21-r1","0.21-r2","1.2.8-r0","1.2.8-r1","1.2.9-r0","1.3.0-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.4.5-r2","1.4.5-r3","1.4.5-r4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-14938.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tcpflow","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tcpflow?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["0.21-r0","0.21-r1","0.21-r2","1.2.8-r0","1.2.8-r1","1.2.9-r0","1.3.0-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.4.5-r2","1.4.5-r3","1.4.5-r4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/AL
