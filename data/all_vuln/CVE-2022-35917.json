When a Solana Pay transaction is located using a reference key, it may be checked to represent a transfer of the desired amount to the recipient, using the supplied `validateTransfer` function. An edge case regarding this mechanism could cause the validation logic to validate multiple transfers. This issue has been patched as of version `0.2.1`. Users of the Solana Pay SDK should upgrade to it. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-35917.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.2.1"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-pay/security/advisories/GHSA-j47c-j42c-mwqq"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-pay/commit/ac6ce0d0a81137700874a8bf5a7caac3be999fad"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-pay/blob/master/SPEC.md#reference"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-pay/blob/master/core/src/validateTransfer.ts"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
