{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"UBUNTU-CVE-2022-2085","published":"2022-06-16T18:15:00Z","modified":"2025-09-08T16:49:35Z","related":["USN-5643-1"],"upstream":["CVE-2022-2085"],"details":"A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was found in Ghostscript, which occurs when it tries to render a large number of bits in memory. When allocating a buffer device, it relies on an init_device_procs defined for the device that uses it as a prototype that depends upon the number of bits per pixel. For bpp > 64, mem_x_device is used and does not have an init_device_procs defined. This flaw allows an attacker to parse a large number of bits (more than 64 bits per pixel), which triggers a NULL pointer dereference flaw, causing an application to crash.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ghostscript","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:22.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/ghostscript@9.55.0~dfsg1-0ubuntu5.1?arch=source&distro=jammy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.55.0~dfsg1-0ubuntu5.1"}]}],"versions":["9.54.0~dfsg1-0ubuntu2","9.55.0~dfsg1-0ubuntu4","9.55.0~dfsg1-0ubuntu5"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"ghostscript","binary_version":"9.55.0~dfsg1-0ubuntu5.1"},{"binary_name":"ghostscript-x","binary_version":"9.55.0~dfsg1-0ubuntu5.1"},{"binary_name":"libgs-dev","binary_version":"9.55.0~dfsg1-0ubuntu5.1"},{"binary_name":"libgs9","binary_version":"9.55.0~dfsg1-0ubuntu5.1"},{"binary_name":"libgs9-common","binary_version":"9.55.0~dfsg1-0ubuntu5.1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2022/UBUNTU-CVE-2022-2085.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-2085"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5643-1"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-2085"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"low"}]}
