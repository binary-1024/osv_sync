{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"UBUNTU-CVE-2026-24001","published":"2026-01-23T00:00:00Z","modified":"2026-01-27T13:00:54.090085Z","upstream":["CVE-2026-24001"],"details":"jsdiff is a JavaScript text differencing implementation. Prior to versions 8.0.3, 5.2.2, and 4.0.4, attempting to parse a patch whose filename headers contain the line break characters `\\r`, `\\u2028`, or `\\u2029` can cause the `parsePatch` method to enter an infinite loop. It then consumes memory without limit until the process crashes due to running out of memory. Applications are therefore likely to be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack if they call `parsePatch` with a user-provided patch as input. A large payload is not needed to trigger the vulnerability, so size limits on user input do not provide any protection. Furthermore, some applications may be vulnerable even when calling `parsePatch` on a patch generated by the application itself if the user is nonetheless able to control the filename headers (e.g. by directly providing the filenames of the files to be diffed). The `applyPatch` method is similarly affected if (and only if) called with a string representation of a patch as an argument, since under the hood it parses that string using `parsePatch`. Other methods of the library are unaffected. Finally, a second and lesser interdependent bug - a ReDOS - also exhibits when those same line break characters are present in a patch's *patch* header (also known as its \"leading garbage\"). A maliciously-crafted patch header of length *n* can take `parsePatch` O(*n*³) time to parse. Versions 8.0.3, 5.2.2, and 4.0.4 contain a fix. As a workaround, do not attempt to parse patches that contain any of these characters: `\\r`, `\\u2028`, or `\\u2029`.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"node-diff","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/node-diff@1.4.0~dfsg-1?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.4.0~dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"node-diff","binary_version":"1.4.0~dfsg-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2026/UBUNTU-CVE-2026-24001.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-diff","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/node-diff@1.4.0~dfsg-1?arch=source&distro=bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.4.0~dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"node-diff","binary_version":"1.4.0~dfsg-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2026/UBUNTU-CVE-2026-24001.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-diff","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:20.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/node-diff@1.4.0~dfsg-3?arch=source&distro=focal"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.4.0~dfsg-2","1.4.0~dfsg-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"node-diff","binary_version":"1.4.0~dfsg-3"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2026/UBUNTU-CVE-2026-24001.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-diff","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:22.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/node-diff@5.0.0~dfsg+~5.0.1-3?arch=source&distro=jammy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.0.2~dfsg-2","5.0.0~dfsg+~5.0.1-1","5.0.0~dfsg+~5.0.1-2","5.0.0~dfsg+~5.0.1-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"node-diff","binary_version":"5.0.0~dfsg+~5.0.1-3"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2026/UBUNTU-CVE-2026-24001.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-diff","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/node-diff@5.0.0~dfsg+~5.0.1-4?arch=source&distro=noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.0.0~dfsg+~5.0.1-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"node-diff","binary_version":"5.0.0~dfsg+~5.0.1-4"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2026/UBUNTU-CVE-2026-24001.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-diff","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.10","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/node-diff@5.0.0~dfsg+~5.0.1-4?arch=source&distro=questing"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.0.0~dfsg+~5.0.1-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"node-diff","binary_version":"5.0.0~dfsg+~5.0.1-4"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2026/UBUNTU-CVE-2026-24001.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2026-24001"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24001"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/security/advisories/GHSA-73rr-hh4g-fpgx"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/issues/653"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/649"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/commit/15a1585230748c8ae6f8274c202e0c87309142f5"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
