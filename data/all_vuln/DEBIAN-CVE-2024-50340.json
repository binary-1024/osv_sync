When the `register_argv_argc` php directive is set to `on` , and users call any URL with a special crafted query string, they are able to change the environment or debug mode used by the kernel when handling the request. As of versions 5.4.46, 6.4.14, and 7.1.7 the `SymfonyRuntime` now ignores the `argv` values for non-SAPI PHP runtimes. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"symfony","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/symfony?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.4.23+dfsg-1+deb12u3"}]}],"versions":["5.4.23+dfsg-1","5.4.23+dfsg-1+deb12u1","5.4.23+dfsg-1+deb12u2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-50340.json"}},{"package":{"name":"symfony","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/symfony?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.4.14+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-50340.json"}},{"package":{"name":"symfony","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/symfony?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.4.14+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-50340.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-50340"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
