{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2023-2804","published":"2023-05-25T22:15:09.443Z","modified":"2025-11-19T06:20:40.206777Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-2804"],"details":"A heap-based buffer overflow issue was discovered in libjpeg-turbo in h2v2_merged_upsample_internal() function of jdmrgext.c file. The vulnerability can only be exploited with 12-bit data precision for which the range of the sample data type exceeds the valid sample range, hence, an attacker could craft a 12-bit lossless JPEG image that contains out-of-range 12-bit samples. An application attempting to decompress such image using merged upsampling would lead to segmentation fault or buffer overflows, causing an application to crash.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libjpeg-turbo","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libjpeg-turbo?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.1.5.1-r3"}]}],"versions":["1.2.1-r0","1.2.1-r1","1.2.1-r2","1.2.1-r3","1.3.0-r0","1.3.0-r1","1.3.1-r0","1.4.0-r0","1.4.1-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.5.0-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.3-r0","1.5.3-r1","1.5.3-r2","1.5.3-r3","1.5.3-r4","2.0.2-r0","2.0.3-r0","2.0.4-r0","2.0.4-r1","2.0.4-r2","2.0.5-r0","2.0.5-r1","2.0.6-r0","2.1.0-r0","2.1.1-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.1.2-r1","2.1.3-r0","2.1.3-r1","2.1.4-r0","2.1.5-r0","2.1.5-r1","2.1.5.1-r0","2.1.5.1-r1","2.1.5.1-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-2804.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libjpeg-turbo","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libjpeg-turbo?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.1.5.1-r4"}]}],"versions":["1.2.1-r0","1.2.1-r1","1.2.1-r2","1.2.1-r3","1.3.0-r0","1.3.0-r1","1.3.1-r0","1.4.0-r0","1.4.1-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.5.0-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.3-r0","1.5.3-r1","1.5.3-r2","1.5.3-r3","1.5.3-r4","2.0.2-r0","2.0.3-r0","2.0.4-r0","2.0.4-r1","2.0.4-r2","2.0.5-r0","2.0.5-r1","2.0.6-r0","2.1.0-r0","2.1.1-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.1.2-r1","2.1.3-r0","2.1.3-r1","2.1.4-r0","2.1.5-r0","2.1.5-r1","2.1.5.1-r0","2.1.5.1-r1","2.1.5.1-r2","2.1.5.1-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-2804.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libjpeg-turbo","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libjpeg-turbo?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.1.5.1-r4"}]}],"versions":["1.2.1-r0","1.2.1-r1","1.2.1-r2","1.2.1-r3","1.3.0-r0","1.3.0-r1","1.3.1-r0","1.4.0-r0","1.4.1-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.5.0-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.3-r0","1.5.3-r1","1.5.3-r2","1.5.3-r3","1.5.3-r4","2.0.2-r0","2.0.3-r0","2.0.4-r0","2.0.4-r1","2.0.4-r2","2.0.5-r0","2.0.5-r1","2.0.6-r0","2.1.0-r0","2.1.1-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.1.2-r1","2.1.3-r0","2.1.3-r1","2.1.4-r0","2.1.5-r0","2.1.5-r1","2.1.5.1-r0","2.1.5.1-r1","2.1.5.1-r2","2.1.5.1-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-2804.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libjpeg-turbo","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libjpeg-turbo?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.1.5.1-r4"}]}],"versions":["1.2.1-r0","1.2.1-r1","1.2.1-r2","1.2.1-r3","1.3.0-r0","1.3.0-r1","1.3.1-r0","1.4.0-r0","1.4.1-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.5.0-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.3-r0","1.5.3-r1","1.5.3-r2","1.5.3-r3","1.5.3-r4","2.0.2-r0","2.0.3-r0","2.0.4-r0","2.0.4-r1","2.0.4-r2","2.0.5-r0","2.0.5-r1","2.0.6-r0","2.1.0-r0","2.1.1-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.1.2-r1","2.1.3-r0","2.1.3-r1","2.1.4-r0","2.1.5-r0","2.1.5-r1","2.1.5.1-r0","2.1.5.1-r1","2.1.5.1-r2","2.1.5.1-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-2804.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libjpeg-turbo","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libjpeg-turbo?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.1.5.1-r4"}]}],"versions":["1.2.1-r0","1.2.1-r1","1.2.1-r2","1.2.1-r3","1.3.0-r0","1.3.0-r1","1.3.1-r0","1.4.0-r0","1.4.1-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.5.0-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.3-r0","1.5.3-r1","1.5.3-r2","1.5.3-r3","1.5.3-r4","2.0.2-r0","2.0.3-r0","2.0.4-r0","2.0.4-r1","2.0.4-r2","2.0.5-r0","2.0.5-r1","2.0.6-r0","2.1.0-r0","2.1.1-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.1.2-r1","2.1.3-r0","2.1.3-r1","2.1.4-r0","2.1.5-r0","2.1.5-r1","2.1.5.1-r0","2.1.5.1-r1","2.1.5.1-r2","2.1.5.1-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-2804.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2023-2804"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
