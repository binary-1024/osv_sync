A pointer dereference in chan_sip while handling SDP negotiation allows an attacker to crash Asterisk when handling an SDP answer to an outgoing T.38 re-invite. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker must cause the chan_sip module to send a T.38 re-invite request to them. Upon receipt, the attacker must send an SDP answer containing both a T.38 UDPTL stream and another media stream containing only a codec (which is not permitted according to the chan_sip configuration).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"asterisk","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/asterisk?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:16.2.1~dfsg-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"low"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-13161.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-13161"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
