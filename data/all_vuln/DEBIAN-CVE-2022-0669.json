This flaw allows a malicious vhost-user master to attach an unexpected number of fds as ancillary data to VHOST_USER_GET_INFLIGHT_FD / VHOST_USER_SET_INFLIGHT_FD messages that are not closed by the vhost-user slave. By sending such messages continuously, the vhost-user master exhausts available fd in the vhost-user slave process, leading to a denial of service.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"dpdk","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dpdk?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"20.11.5-1~deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["20.11-7","20.11.1-1","20.11.1-2","20.11.1-3","20.11.1-4","20.11.2-1","20.11.3-1","20.11.3-1~deb11u1","20.11.3-2","20.11.4-1","20.11.4-2","20.11.4-2~deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-0669.json"}},{"package":{"name":"dpdk","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dpdk?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"20.11.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-0669.json"}},{"package":{"name":"dpdk","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dpdk?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"20.11.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-0669.json"}},{"package":{"name":"dpdk","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dpdk?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"20.11.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-0669.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0669"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
