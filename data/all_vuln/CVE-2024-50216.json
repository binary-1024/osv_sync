  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxfs: fix finding a last resort AG in xfs_filestream_pick_ag\n\nWhen the main loop in xfs_filestream_pick_ag fails to find a suitable\nAG it tries to just pick the online AG.  But the loop for that uses\nargs->pag as loop iterator while the later code expects pag to be\nset.  Fix this by reusing the max_pag case for this last resort, and\nalso add a check for impossible case of no AG just to make sure that\nthe uninitialized pag doesn't even escape in theory.",
