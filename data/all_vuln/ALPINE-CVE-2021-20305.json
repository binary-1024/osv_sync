{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2021-20305","published":"2021-04-05T22:15:12Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:20:13.190239Z","upstream":["CVE-2021-20305"],"details":"A flaw was found in Nettle in versions before 3.7.2, where several Nettle signature verification functions (GOST DSA, EDDSA & ECDSA) result in the Elliptic Curve Cryptography point (ECC) multiply function being called with out-of-range scalers, possibly resulting in incorrect results. This flaw allows an attacker to force an invalid signature, causing an assertion failure or possible validation. The highest threat to this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nettle","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nettle?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4-r0","2.4-r1","2.5-r0","2.6-r0","2.7-r0","2.7.1-r0","3.1-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.2-r0","3.3-r0","3.3-r1","3.3-r2","3.4-r0","3.4-r1","3.4.1-r0","3.4.1-r1","3.5.1-r0","3.5.1-r1","3.6-r0","3.7-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-20305.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nettle","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nettle?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4-r0","2.4-r1","2.5-r0","2.6-r0","2.7-r0","2.7.1-r0","3.1-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.2-r0","3.3-r0","3.3-r1","3.3-r2","3.4-r0","3.4-r1","3.4.1-r0","3.4.1-r1","3.5.1-r0","3.5.1-r1","3.6-r0","3.7-r0","3.7.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-20305.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nettle","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nettle?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4-r0","2.4-r1","2.5-r0","2.6-r0","2.7-r0","2.7.1-r0","3.1-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.2-r0","3.3-r0","3.3-r1","3.3-r2","3.4-r0","3.4-r1","3.4.1-r0","3.4.1-r1","3.5.1-r0","3.5.1-r1","3.6-r0","3.7-r0","3.7.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-20305.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nettle","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nettle?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4-r0","2.4-r1","2.5-r0","2.6-r0","2.7-r0","2.7.1-r0","3.1-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.2-r0","3.3-r0","3.3-r1","3.3-r2","3.4-r0","3.4-r1","3.4.1-r0","3.4.1-r1","3.5.1-r0","3.5.1-r1","3.6-r0","3.7-r0","3.7.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-20305.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nettle","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nettle?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4-r0","2.4-r1","2.5-r0","2.6-r0","2.7-r0","2.7.1-r0","3.1-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.2-r0","3.3-r0","3.3-r1","3.3-r2","3.4-r0","3.4-r1","3.4.1-r0","3.4.1-r1","3.5.1-r0","3.5.1-r1","3.6-r0","3.7-r0","3.7.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-20305.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nettle","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nettle?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4-r0","2.4-r1","2.5-r0","2.6-r0","2.7-r0","2.7.1-r0","3.1-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.2-r0","3.3-r0","3.3-r1","3.3-r2","3.4-r0","3.4-r1","3.4.1-r0","3.4.1-r1","3.5.1-r0","3.5.1-r1","3.6-r0","3.7-r0","3.7.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-20305.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nettle","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nettle?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4-r0","2.4-r1","2.5-r0","2.6-r0","2.7-r0","2.7.1-r0","3.1-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.2-r0","3.3-r0","3.3-r1","3.3-r2","3.4-r0","3.4-r1","3.4.1-r0","3.4.1-r1","3.5.1-r0","3.5.1-r1","3.6-r0","3.7-r0","3.7.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-20305.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nettle","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nettle?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4-r0","2.4-r1","2.5-r0","2.6-r0","2.7-r0","2.7.1-r0","3.1-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.2-r0","3.3-r0","3.3-r1","3.3-r2","3.4-r0","3.4-r1","3.4.1-r0","3.4.1-r1","3.5.1-r0","3.5.1-r1","3.6-r0","3.7-r0","3.7.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-20305.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nettle","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nettle?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4-r0","2.4-r1","2.5-r0","2.6-r0","2.7-r0","2.7.1-r0","3.1-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.2-r0","3.3-r0","3.3-r1","3.3-r2","3.4-r0","3.4-r1","3.4.1-r0","3.4.1-r1","3.5.1-r0","3.5.1-r1","3.6-r0","3.7-r0","3.7.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-20305.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nettle","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nettle?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4-r0","2.4-r1","2.5-r0","2.6-r0","2.7-r0","2
