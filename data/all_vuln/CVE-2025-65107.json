In versions from 2.95.0 to before 2.95.12 and from 3.17.0 to before 3.131.0, in SSO provider configurations without an explicit AUTH_<PROVIDER>_CHECK setting, a potential account takeover may happen if an authenticated user is made to call a specifically crafted URL via a CSRF or phishing attack.

A workaround for this issue involves setting AUTH_<PROVIDER>_CHECK.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse","events":[{"introduced":"22f6a02b08c11eda6a07077f1abd90c991df64f3"},{"fixed":"565ff73591365394a24e047973c15e69d6ffca93"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-65107.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/65xxx/CVE-2025-65107.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/security/advisories/GHSA-w9pw-c549-5m6w"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65107"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-285","CWE-352"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/65xxx/CVE-2025-65107.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
