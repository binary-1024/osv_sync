This occurred because a volatile operation was not specified. For example, within a single execution of a program, the output of every __builtin_darn() call may be the same.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gcc","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gcc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.3.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.3.2-r0","4.3.2-r1","4.3.2-r2","4.3.2-r3","4.3.2-r4","4.3.3-r0","4.3.3-r1","4.3.3-r2","4.4.1-r1","4.4.1-r10","4.4.1-r2","4.4.1-r3","4.4.2-r0","4.4.3-r0","4.4.3-r1","4.4.3-r2","4.4.3-r3","4.4.4-r0","4.4.4-r1","4.4.4-r2","4.4.4-r3","4.4.4-r4","4.4.4-r5","4.5.1-r5","4.5.1-r6","4.5.1-r7","4.5.1-r8","4.5.1-r9","4.5.2-r2","4.5.2-r3","4.5.2-r4","4.5.2-r5","4.5.2-r6","4.5.2-r7","4.5.3-r0","4.6.0-r0","4.6.1-r3","4.6.2-r0","4.6.2-r1","4.6.2-r2","4.6.2-r3","4.6.2-r4","4.6.2-r5","4.6.3-r0","4.7.1-r0","4.7.2-r0","4.7.2-r1","4.7.2-r2","4.7.2-r3","4.7.2-r4","4.7.3-r0","4.7.3-r1","4.7.3-r2","4.7.3-r3","4.7.3-r4","4.7.3-r5","4.7.3-r6","4.7.3-r7","4.7.3-r8","4.8.1-r0","4.8.1-r1","4.8.1-r2","4.8.1-r4","4.8.1-r5","4.8.2-r0","4.8.2-r1","4.8.2-r10","4.8.2-r2","4.8.2-r3","4.8.2-r4","4.8.2-r5","4.8.2-r6","4.8.2-r7","4.8.2-r8","4.8.2-r9","4.8.3-r0","4.9.2-r0","4.9.2-r1","4.9.2-r2","4.9.2-r3","4.9.2-r4","4.9.2-r5","4.9.2-r6","5.1.0-r0","5.2.0-r0","5.3.0-r0","6.1.0-r0","6.1.0-r1","6.1.0-r2","6.1.0-r3","6.1.0-r4","6.1.1-r0","6.2.0-r0","6.2.1-r0","6.2.1-r1","6.3.0-r1","6.3.0-r2","6.3.0-r3","6.3.0-r4","6.4.0-r4","6.4.0-r5","6.4.0-r6","6.4.0-r7","6.4.0-r8","8.2.0-r0","8.2.0-r1","8.2.0-r2","8.3.0-r0","8.3.0-r1","9.2.0-r1","9.2.0-r2","9.2.0-r3","9.2.0-r4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-15847.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2019-15847"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
