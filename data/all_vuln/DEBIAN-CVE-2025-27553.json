The FileObject API in Commons VFS has a 'resolveFile' method that takes a 'scope' parameter. Specifying 'NameScope.DESCENDENT' promises that \"an exception is thrown if the resolved file is not a descendent of the base file\". However, when the path contains encoded \"..\" characters (for example, \"%2E%2E/bar.txt\"), it might return file objects that are not a descendent of the base file, without throwing an exception. This issue affects Apache Commons VFS: before 2.10.0.  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.10.0, which fixes the issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"commons-vfs","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/commons-vfs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.1-2+deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["2.1-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-27553.json"}},{"package":{"name":"commons-vfs","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/commons-vfs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.1-4+deb12u1"}]}],"versions":["2.1-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-27553.json"}},{"package":{"name":"commons-vfs","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/commons-vfs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.1-5"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-27553.json"}},{"package":{"name":"commons-vfs","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/commons-vfs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.1-5"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-27553.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-27553"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
