  "details": "Gnuplot is a portable command-line driven graphing utility for Linux, OS/2, MS Windows, OSX, VMS, and many other platforms. The source code is copyrighted but freely distributed (i.e., you don&amp;apos;t have to pay for it). It was originally created to allow scientists and students to visualize mathematical functions and data interactively, but has grown to support many non-interactive uses such as web scripting. It is also used as a plotting engine by third-party applications like Octave. Gnuplot has been supported and under active development since 1986.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA flaw was found in gnuplot. The plot3d_points() function may lead to a segmentation fault and cause a system crash.(CVE-2025-31176)\n\nA flaw was found in gnuplot. The xstrftime() function may lead to a segmentation fault, causing a system crash.(CVE-2025-31179)\n\nA flaw was found in gnuplot. The CANVAS_text() function may lead to a segmentation fault and cause a system crash.(CVE-2025-31180)\n\nA flaw was found in gnuplot. The X11_graphics() function may lead to a segmentation fault and cause a system crash.(CVE-2025-31181)\n\nA flaw was found in GNUPlot. A segmentation fault via IO_str_init_static_internal may jeopardize the environment.(CVE-2025-3359)",
