To exploit the venerability, a local user starts a transaction (via the hardware transactional memory instruction tbegin) and then accesses vector registers. At some point, the vector registers will be corrupted with the values from a different local Linux process because of a missing arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c check.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00064.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00066.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/09/10/3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0740"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=8205d5d98ef7f155de211f5e2eb6ca03d95a5a60"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20191004-0001/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4135-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4135-2/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L"}]}
