{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-40305","published":"2025-12-08T01:16:02.700Z","modified":"2026-01-02T18:17:35.865963Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-40305"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  9p/trans_fd: p9_fd_request: kick rx thread if EPOLLIN  p9_read_work() doesn't set Rworksched and doesn't do schedule_work(m->rq) if list_empty(&m->req_list).  However, if the pipe is full, we need to read more data and this used to work prior to commit aaec5a95d59615 (\"pipe_read: don't wake up the writer if the pipe is still full\").  p9_read_work() does p9_fd_read() -> ... -> anon_pipe_read() which (before the commit above) triggered the unnecessary wakeup. This wakeup calls p9_pollwake() which kicks p9_poll_workfn() -> p9_poll_mux(), p9_poll_mux() will notice EPOLLIN and schedule_work(&m->rq).  This no longer happens after the optimization above, change p9_fd_request() to use p9_poll_mux() instead of only checking for EPOLLOUT.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.17.8-1"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.57-1","6.12.57-1~bpo12+1","6.12.63-1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.10-1","6.16.11-1","6.16.12-1","6.16.12-1~bpo13+1","6.16.12-2","6.16.3-1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16.5-1","6.16.6-1","6.16.7-1","6.16.8-1","6.16.9-1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1","6.17.2-1~exp1","6.17.5-1~exp1","6.17.6-1","6.17.7-1","6.17.7-2","6.17.8-1~bpo13+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-40305.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-40305"}]}
