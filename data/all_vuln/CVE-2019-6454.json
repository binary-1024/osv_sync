An unprivileged local user can exploit this by sending a specially crafted message to PID1, causing the stack pointer to jump over the stack guard pages into an unmapped memory region and trigger a denial of service (systemd PID1 crash and kernel panic).","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-02/msg00070.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-05/msg00062.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/02/18/3"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/02/19/1"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/07/20/2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107081"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0368"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0990"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1322"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1502"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2805"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commits/master/src/libsystemd/sd-bus/bus-objects.c"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10278"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/02/msg00031.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190327-0004/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3891-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4393"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/N67IOBOTDOMVNQJ5QRU2MXLEECXPGNVJ/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
