{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2020-12826","published":"2020-05-12T19:15:11Z","modified":"2025-08-09T19:01:28Z","related":["ALSA-2020:4431"],"details":"A signal access-control issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.6.5, aka CID-7395ea4e65c2. Because exec_id in include/linux/sched.h is only 32 bits, an integer overflow can interfere with a do_notify_parent protection mechanism. A child process can send an arbitrary signal to a parent process in a different security domain. Exploitation limitations include the amount of elapsed time before an integer overflow occurs, and the lack of scenarios where signals to a parent process present a substantial operational threat.","references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1822077"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/ChangeLog-5.6.5"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/7395ea4e65c2a00d23185a3f63ad315756ba9cef"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://lists.openwall.net/linux-kernel/2020/03/24/1803"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200608-0001/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4367-1/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/03/25/1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/06/msg00011.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/06/msg00013.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4369-1/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4391-1/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
