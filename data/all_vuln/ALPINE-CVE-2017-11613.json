A crafted input will lead to a denial of service attack. During the TIFFOpen process, td_imagelength is not checked. The value of td_imagelength can be directly controlled by an input file. In the ChopUpSingleUncompressedStrip function, the _TIFFCheckMalloc function is called based on td_imagelength. If we set the value of td_imagelength close to the amount of system memory, it will hang the system or trigger the OOM killer.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"tiff","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tiff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.9-r6"}]}],"versions":["3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.9.5-r0","3.9.5-r1","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.0.3-r2","4.0.3-r3","4.0.6-r0","4.0.6-r1","4.0.6-r2","4.0.6-r3","4.0.7-r0","4.0.7-r1","4.0.7-r2","4.0.7-r3","4.0.8-r0","4.0.8-r1","4.0.9-r0","4.0.9-r1","4.0.9-r2","4.0.9-r3","4.0.9-r4","4.0.9-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-11613.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tiff","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tiff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.9-r6"}]}],"versions":["3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.9.5-r0","3.9.5-r1","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.0.3-r2","4.0.3-r3","4.0.6-r0","4.0.6-r1","4.0.6-r2","4.0.6-r3","4.0.7-r0","4.0.7-r1","4.0.7-r2","4.0.7-r3","4.0.8-r0","4.0.8-r1","4.0.9-r0","4.0.9-r1","4.0.9-r2","4.0.9-r3","4.0.9-r4","4.0.9-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-11613.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tiff","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tiff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.9-r6"}]}],"versions":["3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.9.5-r0","3.9.5-r1","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.0.3-r2","4.0.3-r3","4.0.6-r0","4.0.6-r1","4.0.6-r2","4.0.6-r3","4.0.7-r0","4.0.7-r1","4.0.7-r2","4.0.7-r3","4.0.8-r0","4.0.8-r1","4.0.9-r0","4.0.9-r1","4.0.9-r2","4.0.9-r3","4.0.9-r4","4.0.9-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-11613.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tiff","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tiff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.9-r6"}]}],"versions":["3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.9.5-r0","3.9.5-r1","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.0.3-r2","4.0.3-r3","4.0.6-r0","4.0.6-r1","4.0.6-r2","4.0.6-r3","4.0.7-r0","4.0.7-r1","4.0.7-r2","4.0.7-r3","4.0.8-r0","4.0.8-r1","4.0.9-r0","4.0.9-r1","4.0.9-r2","4.0.9-r3","4.0.9-r4","4.0.9-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-11613.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tiff","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tiff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.9-r6"}]}],"versions":["3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.9.5-r0","3.9.5-r1","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.0.3-r2","4.0.3-r3","4.0.6-r0","4.0.6-r1","4.0.6-r2","4.0.6-r3","4.0.7-r0","4.0.7-r1","4.0.7-r2","4.0.7-r3","4.0.8-r0","4.0.8-r1","4.0.9-r0","4.0.9-r1","4.0.9-r2","4.0.9-r3","4.0.9-r4","4.0.9-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-11613.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tiff","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tiff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.9-r6"}]}],"versions":["3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.9.5-r0","3.9.5-r1","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.0.3-r2","4.0.3-r3","4.0.6-r0","4.0.6-r1","4.0.6-r2","4.0.6-r3","4.0.7-r0","4.0.7-r1","4.0.7-r2","4.0.7-r3","4.0.8-r0","4.0.8-r1","4.0.9-r0","4.0.9-r1","4.0.9-r2","4.0.9-r3","4.0.9-r4","4.0.9-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-11613.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tiff","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tiff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.9-r6"}]}],"versions":["3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.9.5-r0","3.9.5-r1","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.0.3-r2","4.0.3-r3","4.0.6-r0","4.0.6-r1","4.0.6-r2","4.0.6-r3","4.0.7-r0","4.0.7-r1","4.0.7-r2","4.0.7-r3","4.0.8-r0","4.0.8-r1","4.0.9-r0","4.0.9-r1","4.0.9-r2","4.0.9-r3","4.0.9-r4","4.0.9-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-11613.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tiff","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tiff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.9-r6"}]}],"versions":["3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.9.5-r0","3.9.5-r1","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.0.3-r2","4.0.3-r3","4.0.6-r0","4.0.6-r1","4.0.6-r2","4.0.6-r3","4.0.7-r0","4.0.7-r1","4.0.7-r2","4.0.7-r3","4.0.8-r0","4.0.8-r1","4.0.9-r0","4.0.9-r1","4.0.9-r2","4.0.9-r3","4.0.9-r
