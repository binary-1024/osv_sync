RSA blinding was applied to prevent timing attacks, but analysis shows this may not have been fully effective. In particular it appears as if the removal of PKCS#1 padding may leak timing information, which in turn could be used to recover session key bits. In Go 1.20, the crypto/tls library switched to a fully constant time RSA implementation, which we do not believe exhibits any timing side channels.","references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/QMK8IQALDvA"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://people.redhat.com/~hkario/marvin/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2375"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240112-0005/"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://go.dev/cl/326012/26"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://go.dev/issue/20654"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
