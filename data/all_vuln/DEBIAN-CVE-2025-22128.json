This does no harm unless one of the functions requesting the IRQ fails and attempt to free the IRQ.  This may end up with a warning from the IRQ core that is expecting the affinity hint to be cleared before freeing the IRQ:  kernel/irq/manage.c:  \t/* make sure affinity_hint is cleaned up */ \tif (WARN_ON_ONCE(desc->affinity_hint)) \t\tdesc->affinity_hint = NULL;  So to fix this issue, clear the IRQ affinity hint before calling ath12k_pci_free_irq() in the error path. The affinity will be cleared once again further down the error path due to code organization, but that does no harm.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.35-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-22128.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.35-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-22128.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-22128"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
