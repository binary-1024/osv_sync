Combined with another vulnerability, it can be used to leak stack memory and bypass ASLR. This attack appear to be exploitable via network connectivity. These vulnerabilities have been fixed in commit d01e1bb4246323ba6fcee3b82ef1faa9b1dac82a.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libvncserver","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libvncserver?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.9.11-r3"}]}],"versions":["0.9.10-r0","0.9.10-r1","0.9.11-r0","0.9.11-r1","0.9.11-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-15681.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libvncserver","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libvncserver?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.9.12-r1"}]}],"versions":["0.9.10-r0","0.9.10-r1","0.9.11-r0","0.9.11-r1","0.9.11-r2","0.9.12-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-15681.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libvncserver","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.7","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libvncserver?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.9.11-r3"}]}],"versions":["0.9.10-r0","0.9.10-r1","0.9.11-r0","0.9.11-r1","0.9.11-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-15681.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libvncserver","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.8","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libvncserver?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.9.11-r3"}]}],"versions":["0.9.10-r0","0.9.10-r1","0.9.11-r0","0.9.11-r1","0.9.11-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-15681.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libvncserver","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.9","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libvncserver?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.9.11-r3"}]}],"versions":["0.9.10-r0","0.9.10-r1","0.9.11-r0","0.9.11-r1","0.9.11-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-15681.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2019-15681"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
