For an rcp operation, the server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the rcp client only performs cursory validation of the object name returned. A malicious rsh server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in a directory on the rcp client machine. This is similar to CVE-2019-6111.","references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugs.debian.org/920486"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/11/msg00016.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://sintonen.fi/advisories/scp-client-multiple-vulnerabilities.txt"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H"}]}
