It has a limited risk.\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (cef37dc88df4671463fc8bc348bdd850f5441d75c92f6e20a0c9379b9d7178b6)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'artifact-lab-3-package-9fde789f' @ 0.1.0 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package-9fde789f","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-9fde789f"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-9fde789f/MAL-2024-8026.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package-9fde789f"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-08-23T10:05:04.851990119Z","modified_time":"2024-08-23T09:51:07Z","sha256":"cef37dc88df4671463fc8bc348bdd850f5441d75c92f6e20a0c9379b9d7178b6","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["0.1.0"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-9fde789f","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.92957301Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"c92eeff7ddd959983217432ed299788414a45654df57be077feb481d5a374115","source":"kam193"}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
