{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-53174","published":"2024-12-27T14:15:24Z","modified":"2025-10-14T04:26:38.003780Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-53174"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  SUNRPC: make sure cache entry active before cache_show  The function `c_show` was called with protection from RCU. This only ensures that `cp` will not be freed. Therefore, the reference count for `cp` can drop to zero, which will trigger a refcount use-after-free warning when `cache_get` is called. To resolve this issue, use `cache_get_rcu` to ensure that `cp` remains active.  ------------[ cut here ]------------ refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.
