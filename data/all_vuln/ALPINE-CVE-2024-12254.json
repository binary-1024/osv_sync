Because of this, Protocols would not periodically drain the write\n buffer potentially leading to memory exhaustion.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis\n vulnerability likely impacts a small number of users, you must be using\n Python 3.12.0 or later, on macOS or Linux, using the asyncio module \nwith protocols, and using .writelines() method which had new \nzero-copy-on-write behavior in Python 3.12.0 and later. If not all of \nthese factors are true then your usage of Python is unaffected.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/python3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.12.8-r1"}]}],"versions":["3.1.3-r0","3.10.0-r0","3.10.0-r1","3.10.1-r0","3.10.2-r0","3.10.2-r1","3.10.3-r0","3.10.3-r1","3.10.4-r0","3.10.5-r0","3.10.5-r1","3.10.5-r2","3.10.6-r0","3.10.6-r1","3.10.7-r0","3.10.8-r0","3.10.8-r1","3.10.8-r2","3.10.8-r3","3.11.0-r0","3.11.0-r1","3.11.0-r2","3.11.1-r0","3.11.1-r1","3.11.1-r2","3.11.1-r3","3.11.1-r4","3.11.2-r0","3.11.3-r0","3.11.3-r1","3.11.3-r10","3.11.3-r11","3.11.3-r2","3.11.3-r3","3.11.3-r4","3.11.3-r5","3.11.3-r6","3.11.3-r7","3.11.3-r8","3.11.3-r9","3.11.4-r0","3.11.4-r1","3.11.4-r2","3.11.4-r3","3.11.4-r4","3.11.5-r0","3.11.6-r0","3.11.6-r1","3.11.6-r2","3.11.7-r0","3.11.7-r1","3.11.8-r0","3.12.2-r0","3.12.2-r1","3.12.3-r0","3.12.3-r1","3.12.3-r2","3.12.6-r0","3.12.7-r0","3.12.8-r0","3.2.0-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.3.0-r0","3.3.2-r0","3.3.3-r0","3.3.4-r0","3.4.1-r0","3.4.2-r0","3.4.2-r1","3.4.3-r1","3.4.3-r2","3.5.0-r0","3.5.1-r0","3.5.1-r1","3.5.1-r2","3.5.1-r3","3.5.2-r0","3.5.2-r1","3.5.2-r10","3.5.2-r2","3.5.2-r3","3.5.2-r4","3.5.2-r5","3.5.2-r6","3.5.2-r7","3.5.2-r8","3.5.2-r9","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.1-r1","3.6.1-r2","3.6.1-r3","3.6.1-r4","3.6.2-r0","3.6.2-r1","3.6.2-r2","3.6.2-r3","3.6.3-r3","3.6.3-r4","3.6.3-r5","3.6.3-r6","3.6.3-r7","3.6.3-r8","3.6.3-r9","3.6.4-r0","3.6.4-r1","3.6.6-r0","3.6.6-r1","3.6.6-r2","3.6.6-r3","3.6.7-r0","3.6.8-r0","3.6.8-r1","3.6.8-r2","3.7.2-r0","3.7.3-r0","3.7.3-r1","3.7.4-r0","3.7.5-r0","3.7.5-r1","3.8.0-r0","3.8.1-r0","3.8.1-r1","3.8.1-r2","3.8.1-r3","3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.8.2-r5","3.8.2-r6","3.8.2-r7","3.8.3-r0","3.8.4-r0","3.8.5-r0","3.8.5-r1","3.8.5-r2","3.8.6-r0","3.8.7-r0","3.8.7-r1","3.8.7-r2","3.8.7-r3","3.8.8-r0","3.9.1-r0","3.9.2-r0","3.9.4-r0","3.9.5-r0","3.9.5-r1","3.9.6-r0","3.9.6-r1","3.9.6-r2","3.9.7-r2","3.9.7-r3","3.9.7-r4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-12254.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/python3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.12.8-r1"}]}],"versions":["3.1.3-r0","3.10.0-r0","3.10.0-r1","3.10.1-r0","3.10.2-r0","3.10.2-r1","3.10.3-r0","3.10.3-r1","3.10.4-r0","3.10.5-r0","3.10.5-r1","3.10.5-r2","3.10.6-r0","3.10.6-r1","3.10.7-r0","3.10.8-r0","3.10.8-r1","3.10.8-r2","3.10.8-r3","3.11.0-r0","3.11.0-r1","3.11.0-r2","3.11.1-r0","3.11.1-r1","3.11.1-r2","3.11.1-r3","3.11.1-r4","3.11.2-r0","3.11.3-r0","3.11.3-r1","3.11.3-r10","3.11.3-r11","3.11.3-r2","3.11.3-r3","3.11.3-r4","3.11.3-r5","3.11.3-r6","3.11.3-r7","3.11.3-r8","3.11.3-r9","3.11.4-r0","3.11.4-r1","3.11.4-r2","3.11.4-r3","3.11.4-r4","3.11.5-r0","3.11.6-r0","3.11.6-r1","3.11.6-r2","3.11.7-r0","3.11.7-r1","3.11.8-r0","3.12.2-r0","3.12.2-r1","3.12.3-r0","3.12.3-r1","3.12.4-r0","3.12.5-r0","3.12.5-r1","3.12.6-r0","3.12.7-r0","3.12.7-r1","3.12.8-r0","3.2.0-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.3.0-r0","3.3.2-r0","3.3.3-r0","3.3.4-r0","3.4.1-r0","3.4.2-r0","3.4.2-r1","3.4.3-r1","3.4.3-r2","3.5.0-r0","3.5.1-r0","3.5.1-r1","3.5.1-r2","3.5.1-r3","3.5.2-r0","3.5.2-r1","3.5.2-r10","3.5.2-r2","3.5.2-r3","3.5.2-r4","3.5.2-r5","3.5.2-r6","3.5.2-r7","3.5.2-r8","3.5.2-r9","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.1-r1","3.6.1-r2","3.6.1-r3","3.6.1-r4","3.6.2-r0","3.6.2-r1","3.6.2-r2","3.6.2-r3","3.6.3-r3","3.6.3-r4","3.6.3-r5","3.6.3-r6","3.6.3-r7","3.6.3-r8","3.6.3-r9","3.6.4-r0","3.6.4-r1","3.6.6-r0","3.6.6-r1","3.6.6-r2","3.6.6-r3","3.6.7-r0","3.6.8-r0","3.6.8-r1","3.6.8-r2","3.7.2-r0","3.7.3-r0","3.7.3-r1","3.7.4-r0","3.7.5-r0","3.7.5-r1","3.8.0-r0","3.8.1-r0","3.8.1-r1","3.8.1-r2","3.8.1-r3","3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.8.2-r5","3.8.2-r6","3.8.2-r7","3.8.3-r0","3.8.4-r0","3.8.5-r0","3.8.5-r1","3.8.5-r2","3.8.6-r0","3.8.7-r0","3.8.7-r1","3.8.7-r2","3.8.7-r3","3.8.8-r0","3.9.1-r0","3.9.2-r0","3.9.4-r0","3.9.5-r0","3.9.5-r1","3.9.6-r0","3.9.6-r1","3.9.6-r2","3.9.7-r2","3.9.7-r3","3.9.7-r4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-12254.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/python3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.12.8-r1"}]}],"versions":["3.1.3-r0","3.10.0-r0","3.10.0-r1","3.10.1-r0","3.10.2-r0","3.10.2-r1","3.10.3-r0","3.10.3-r1","3.10.4-r0","3.10.5-r0","3.10.5-r1","3.10.5-r2","3.10.6-r0","3.10.6-r1","3.10.7-r0","3.10.8-r0","3.10.8-r1","3.10.8-r2","3.10.8-r3","3.11.0-r0","3.11.0-r1","3.11.0-r2","3.11.1-r0","3.11.1-r1","3.11.1-r2","3.11.1-r3","3.11.1-r4","3.11.2-r0","3.11.3-r0","3.11.3-r1","3.11.3-r10","3.11.3-r11","3.11.3-r2","3.11.3-r3","3.11.3-r4","3.11.3-r5","3.11.3-r6","3.11.3-r7","3.11.3-r8","3.11.3-r9","3.11.4-r0","3.11.4-r1","3.11.4-r2","3.11.4-r3","3.11.4-r4","3.11.5-r0","3.11.6-r0","3.11.6-r1"
