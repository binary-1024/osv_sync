In versions 1.2.7 and below, 1.3.0-rc.1 through 1.3.1, 1.4.0-rc.1 and 1.4.0-rc.2 files, runc would not perform sufficient verification that the source of the bind-mount (i.e., the container's /dev/null) was actually a real /dev/null inode when using the container's /dev/null to mask. This exposes two methods of attack:  an arbitrary mount gadget, leading to host information disclosure, host denial of service, container escape, or a bypassing of maskedPaths. This issue is fixed in versions 1.2.8, 1.3.3 and 1.4.0-rc.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1a30a8f3d921acbbb6a4bb7e99da2c05f8d48522"},{"fixed":"5d7b2424072449872d1cd0c937f2ca25f418eb66"},{"fixed":"8476df83b534a2522b878c0507b3491def48db9f"},{"fixed":"db19bbed5348847da433faa9d69e9f90192bfa64"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.0.9","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-rc1","v1.0.0-rc10","v1.0.0-rc2","v1.0.0-rc3","v1.0.0-rc4","v1.0.0-rc5","v1.0.0-rc6","v1.0.0-rc7","v1.0.0-rc8","v1.0.0-rc9","v1.0.0-rc90","v1.0.0-rc91","v1.0.0-rc92","v1.0.0-rc93","v1.0.0-rc94","v1.0.0-rc95","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-rc.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-rc.1","v1.2.0-rc.2","v1.2.0-rc.3","v1.3.0-rc.1","v1.4.0-rc.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-31133.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/1a30a8f3d921acbbb6a4bb7e99da2c05f8d48522"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/5d7b2424072449872d1cd0c937f2ca25f418eb66"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/8476df83b534a2522b878c0507b3491def48db9f"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/db19bbed5348847da433faa9d69e9f90192bfa64"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-9493-h29p-rfm2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-363","CWE-61"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H"}]}
