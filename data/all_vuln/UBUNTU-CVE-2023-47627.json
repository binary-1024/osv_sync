The HTTP parser in AIOHTTP has numerous problems with header parsing, which could lead to request smuggling. This parser is only used when AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS is enabled (or not using a prebuilt wheel). These bugs have been addressed in commit `d5c12ba89` which has been included in release version 3.8.6. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for these issues.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-aiohttp","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:Pro:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/python-aiohttp@3.0.1-1ubuntu0.1~esm5?arch=source&distro=esm-apps/bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.2.3-1build1","2.2.3-2","2.3.6-1","3.0.1-1","3.0.1-1ubuntu0.1~esm1","3.0.1-1ubuntu0.1~esm4","3.0.1-1ubuntu0.1~esm5"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"python3-aiohttp","binary_version":"3.0.1-1ubuntu0.1~esm5"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2023/UBUNTU-CVE-2023-47627.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-aiohttp","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:Pro:22.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/python-aiohttp@3.8.1-4ubuntu0.2+esm1?arch=source&distro=esm-apps/jammy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.8.1-4ubuntu0.2+esm1"}]}],"versions":["3.7.4-1","3.7.4-1build2","3.8.1-3","3.8.1-4","3.8.1-4build1","3.8.1-4ubuntu0.2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"Available with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro","binaries":[{"binary_name":"python3-aiohttp","binary_version":"3.8.1-4ubuntu0.2+esm1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2023/UBUNTU-CVE-2023-47627.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2023-47627"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-gfw2-4jvh-wgfg"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/d5c12ba890557a575c313bb3017910d7616fce3d"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47627"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7642-1"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"},{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
