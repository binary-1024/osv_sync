This vulnerability is triggered when tcpedit_dlt_cleanup() indirectly invokes the cleanup routine multiple times on the same memory region. By supplying a specifically crafted pcap file to the tcprewrite binary, a local attacker can exploit this flaw to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via memory corruption.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"tcpreplay","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/tcpreplay?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.3.3-2","4.3.4-1","4.4.0-1","4.4.1-1","4.4.1-2","4.4.2-1","4.4.3-1","4.4.4-1","4.5.1-1","4.5.2-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-51006.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tcpreplay","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/tcpreplay?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.4.3-1","4.4.4-1","4.5.1-1","4.5.2-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-51006.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tcpreplay","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/tcpreplay?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.5.1-1","4.5.2-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-51006.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tcpreplay","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/tcpreplay?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.5.2-1"}]}],"versions":["4.5.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-51006.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-51006"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
