The same attacks can achieve SQL injection as a superuser of the restore target server.  pg_dumpall, pg_restore, and pg_upgrade are also affected.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.6, 16.10, 15.14, 14.19, and 13.22 are affected.  Versions before 11.20 are unaffected.  CVE-2012-0868 had fixed this class of problem, but version 11.20 reintroduced it.","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2025-8715/"}]}
