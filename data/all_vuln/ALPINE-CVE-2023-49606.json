A specially crafted HTTP header can trigger reuse of previously freed memory, which leads to memory corruption and could lead to remote code execution. An attacker needs to make an unauthenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"tinyproxy","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tinyproxy?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-r0","1.10.0-r1","1.10.0-r2","1.10.0-r3","1.10.0-r4","1.11.0-r0","1.11.1-r0","1.11.1-r1","1.11.1-r2","1.6.3-r0","1.6.3-r1","1.6.3-r2","1.6.3-r3","1.6.5-r4","1.6.5-r5","1.6.5-r6","1.6.5-r7","1.8.3-r0","1.8.3-r1","1.8.3-r2","1.8.3-r3","1.8.3-r4","1.8.3-r5","1.8.4-r0","1.8.4-r1","1.8.4-r2","1.8.4-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-49606.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tinyproxy","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tinyproxy?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-r0","1.10.0-r1","1.10.0-r2","1.10.0-r3","1.10.0-r4","1.11.0-r0","1.11.1-r0","1.11.1-r1","1.11.1-r2","1.6.3-r0","1.6.3-r1","1.6.3-r2","1.6.3-r3","1.6.5-r4","1.6.5-r5","1.6.5-r6","1.6.5-r7","1.8.3-r0","1.8.3-r1","1.8.3-r2","1.8.3-r3","1.8.3-r4","1.8.3-r5","1.8.4-r0","1.8.4-r1","1.8.4-r2","1.8.4-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-49606.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tinyproxy","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tinyproxy?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-r0","1.10.0-r1","1.10.0-r2","1.10.0-r3","1.10.0-r4","1.11.0-r0","1.11.1-r0","1.11.1-r1","1.11.1-r2","1.11.1-r3","1.6.3-r0","1.6.3-r1","1.6.3-r2","1.6.3-r3","1.6.5-r4","1.6.5-r5","1.6.5-r6","1.6.5-r7","1.8.3-r0","1.8.3-r1","1.8.3-r2","1.8.3-r3","1.8.3-r4","1.8.3-r5","1.8.4-r0","1.8.4-r1","1.8.4-r2","1.8.4-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-49606.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tinyproxy","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tinyproxy?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-r0","1.10.0-r1","1.10.0-r2","1.10.0-r3","1.10.0-r4","1.11.0-r0","1.11.1-r0","1.11.1-r1","1.11.1-r2","1.11.1-r3","1.6.3-r0","1.6.3-r1","1.6.3-r2","1.6.3-r3","1.6.5-r4","1.6.5-r5","1.6.5-r6","1.6.5-r7","1.8.3-r0","1.8.3-r1","1.8.3-r2","1.8.3-r3","1.8.3-r4","1.8.3-r5","1.8.4-r0","1.8.4-r1","1.8.4-r2","1.8.4-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-49606.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tinyproxy","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tinyproxy?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-r0","1.10.0-r1","1.10.0-r2","1.10.0-r3","1.10.0-r4","1.11.0-r0","1.11.1-r0","1.11.1-r1","1.11.1-r2","1.11.1-r3","1.6.3-r0","1.6.3-r1","1.6.3-r2","1.6.3-r3","1.6.5-r4","1.6.5-r5","1.6.5-r6","1.6.5-r7","1.8.3-r0","1.8.3-r1","1.8.3-r2","1.8.3-r3","1.8.3-r4","1.8.3-r5","1.8.4-r0","1.8.4-r1","1.8.4-r2","1.8.4-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-49606.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tinyproxy","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tinyproxy?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-r0","1.10.0-r1","1.10.0-r2","1.10.0-r3","1.10.0-r4","1.11.0-r0","1.11.1-r0","1.11.1-r1","1.11.1-r2","1.11.1-r3","1.6.3-r0","1.6.3-r1","1.6.3-r2","1.6.3-r3","1.6.5-r4","1.6.5-r5","1.6.5-r6","1.6.5-r7","1.8.3-r0","1.8.3-r1","1.8.3-r2","1.8.3-r3","1.8.3-r4","1.8.3-r5","1.8.4-r0","1.8.4-r1","1.8.4-r2","1.8.4-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-49606.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tinyproxy","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/tinyproxy?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-r0","1.10.0-r1","1.10.0-r2","1.10.0-r3","1.10.0-r4","1.11.0-r0","1.11.1-r0","1.11.1-r1","1.11.1-r2","1.11.1-r3","1.6.3-r0","1.6.3-r1","1.6.3-r2","1.6.3-r3","1.6.5-r4","1.6.5-r5","1.6.5-r6","1.6.5-r7","1.8.3-r0","1.8.3-r1","1.8.3-r2","1.8.3-r3","1.8.3-r4","1.8.3-r5","1.8.4-r0","1.8.4-r1","1.8.4-r2","1.8.4-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-49606.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2023-49606"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
