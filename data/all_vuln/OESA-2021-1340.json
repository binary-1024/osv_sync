  "details": "SSSD provides a set of daemons to manage access to remote directories and authentication mechanisms such as LDAP, Kerberos or FreeIPA. It provides an NSS and PAM interface toward the system and a pluggable backend system to connect to multiple different account sources.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in SSSD, where the sssctl command was vulnerable to shell command injection via the logs-fetch and cache-expire subcommands. This flaw allows an attacker to trick the root user into running a specially crafted sssctl command, such as via sudo, to gain root access. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.(CVE-2021-3621)",
