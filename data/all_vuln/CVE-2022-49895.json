  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncxl/region: Fix decoder allocation crash\n\nWhen an intermediate port's decoders have been exhausted by existing\nregions, and creating a new region with the port in question in it's\nhierarchical path is attempted, cxl_port_attach_region() fails to find a\nport decoder (as would be expected), and drops into the failure / cleanup\npath.\n\nHowever, during cleanup of the region reference, a sanity check attempts\nto dereference the decoder, which in the above case didn't exist. This\ncauses a NULL pointer dereference BUG.\n\nTo fix this, refactor the decoder allocation and de-allocation into\nhelper routines, and in this 'free' routine, check that the decoder,\n@cxld, is valid before attempting any operations on it.",
