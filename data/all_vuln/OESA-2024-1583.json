A crafted file may trigger memory write past an allocated heap buffer in `start_decoder`. The root cause is a potential integer overflow in `sizeof(char*) * (f-&gt;comment_list_length)` which may make `setup_malloc` allocate less memory than required. Since there is another integer overflow an attacker may overflow it too to force `setup_malloc` to return 0 and make the exploit more reliable. This issue may lead to code execution.(CVE-2023-45681)\r\n\r\nA heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the comment functionality of stb _vorbis.c v1.22. A specially crafted .ogg file can lead to an out-of-bounds write. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.(CVE-2023-47212)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"stb","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/stb&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["stb_tilemap_editor-devel-0.42.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","stb_voxel_render-devel-0.89.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","stb_sprintf-devel-1.10.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","stb_dxt-devel-1.12.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","stb_image_write-devel-1.16.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","stb_hexwave-devel-0.5.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","stb_image_resize-devel-0.97.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","stb_image-devel-2.27.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","stb_vorbis-devel-1.22.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","stb_easy_font-devel-1.1.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","stb_divide-devel-0.94.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","stb_herringbone_wang_tile-devel-0.7.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","stb-devel-0.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","stb_truetype-devel-1.26.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","stb_perlin-devel-0.5.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","stb_connected_components-devel-0.96.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","stb_rect_pack-devel-1.1.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","stb_ds-devel-0.67.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","stb_leakcheck-devel-0.6.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","stb_c_lexer-devel-0.12.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","stb_textedit-devel-1.14.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["stb-help-0.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.noarch.rpm"],"src":["stb-0.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["stb_connected_components-devel-0.96.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","stb_image-devel-2.27.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","stb_sprintf-devel-1.10.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","stb_leakcheck-devel-0.6.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","stb_c_lexer-devel-0.12.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","stb-devel-0.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","stb_truetype-devel-1.26.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","stb_divide-devel-0.94.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","stb_voxel_render-devel-0.89.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","stb_image_write-devel-1.16.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","stb_tilemap_editor-devel-0.42.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","stb_herringbone_wang_tile-devel-0.7.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","stb_image_resize-devel-0.97.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","stb_easy_font-devel-1.1.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","stb_ds-devel-0.67.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","stb_hexwave-devel-0.5.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","stb_perlin-devel-0.5.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","stb_rect_pack-devel-1.1.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","stb_vorbis-devel-1.22.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","stb_dxt-devel-1.12.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","stb_textedit-devel-1.14.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.16.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-1583.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2024-1583"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45681"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47212"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Critical"}}
