  "details": "An issue was discovered in Exempi through 2.4.4. There is a stack-based\nbuffer over-read in the PostScript_MetaHandler::ParsePSFile() function\nin PostScript_Handler.cpp (CVE-2018-7729).\n\nAn issue was discovered in Exempi through 2.4.4. WEBP_Support.cpp does\nnot check whether a bitstream has a NULL value, leading to a NULL\npointer dereference in the WEBP::VP8XChunk class (CVE-2018-7731).\n\nAn issue was discovered in Exempi before 2.4.4. Integer overflow in the\nChunk class in RIFF.cpp allows remote attackers to cause a denial of\nservice (infinite loop) via crafted XMP data in a .avi file\n(CVE-2017-18233).\n\nAn issue was discovered in Exempi before 2.4.3. It allows remote\nattackers to cause a denial of service (invalid memcpy with resultant\nuse-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a .pdf\nfile containing JPEG data, related to ReconcileTIFF.cpp,\nTIFF_MemoryReader.cpp, and TIFF_Support.hpp (CVE-2017-18234).\n\nAn issue was discovered in Exempi before 2.4.3. The VPXChunk class in\nWEBP_Support.cpp does not ensure nonzero widths and heights, which\nallows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure\nand application exit) via a crafted .webp file (CVE-2017-18235).\n\nAn issue was discovered in Exempi before 2.4.4. The\nASF_Support::ReadHeaderObject function in ASF_Support.cpp allows remote\nattackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a crafted\n.asf file (CVE-2017-18236).\n\nAn issue was discovered in Exempi before 2.4.3. The\nPostScript_Support::ConvertToDate function in PostScript_Support.cpp\nallows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid pointer\ndereference and application crash) via a crafted .ps file\n(CVE-2017-18237).\n",
