{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-24559","published":"2024-02-05T21:04:42Z","modified":"2025-11-04T19:33:30Z","aliases":["GHSA-6845-xw22-ffxv","PYSEC-2024-147"],"summary":"Vyper SHA3 code generation bug","details":"Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. There is an error in the stack management when compiling the `IR` for `sha3_64`. Concretely, the `height` variable is miscalculated. The vulnerability can't be triggered without writing the `IR` by hand (that is, it cannot be triggered from regular vyper code). `sha3_64` is used for retrieval in mappings. No flow that would cache the `key` was found so the issue shouldn't be possible to trigger when compiling the compiler-generated `IR`. This issue isn't triggered during normal compilation of vyper code so the impact is low. At the time of publication there is no patch available.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-24559.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/c150fc49ee9375a930d177044559b83cb95f7963/vyper/ir/compile_ir.py#L585-L586"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-6845-xw22-ffxv"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-327"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
