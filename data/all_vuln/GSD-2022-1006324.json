This is also known as ZDI-CAN-18333, and public reports of exploitation are available. There are additional reports that indicate that attackers may be making use of an older, known (and fixed) vulnerability and that these newly exploited systems are not correctly patched and vulnerable to older exploits, however it should be noted that the ZDI reference does exist.",
