Introduced in b5dba59e0cf7e2cc4d3b3b1ac5fe81ddf21959eb, patched in 9eac1904d3364254d622bf2c771c4f85cd435fc2, backported to stable in 788d0824269bef539fe31a785b1517882eafed93.(CVE-2023-1295)\n\nA heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux Kernel ipvlan network driver can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\n\nThe out-of-bounds write is caused by missing skb-&gt;cb  initialization in the ipvlan network driver. The vulnerability is reachable if CONFIG_IPVLAN is enabled.\n\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 90cbed5247439a966b645b34eb0a2e037836ea8e.\n\n(CVE-2023-3090)\n\nA use-after-free flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel when processing named and anonymous sets in batch requests, which can lead to performing arbitrary reads and writes in kernel memory. This flaw allows a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2023-3117)\n\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.1-rc8. dpu_crtc_atomic_check in drivers/gpu/drm/msm/disp/dpu1/dpu_crtc.c lacks check of the return value of kzalloc() and will cause the NULL Pointer Dereference.(CVE-2023-3220)\n\nA flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel DECnet networking protocol was found. A remote user could use this flaw to crash the system.(CVE-2023-3338)\n\nA null pointer dereference was found in the Linux kernel&apos;s Integrated Sensor Hub (ISH) driver. This issue could allow a local user to crash the system.(CVE-2023-3358)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kernel","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/kernel&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["bpftool-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.aarch64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.aarch64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["kernel-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python3-perf-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.x86_64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.x86_64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2307.4.0.0210.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2023-1438.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2023-1438"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1295"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3090"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3117"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3220"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3338"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3358"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
