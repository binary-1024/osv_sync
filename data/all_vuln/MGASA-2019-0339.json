  "details": "dbus before 1.10.28, 1.12.x before 1.12.16, and 1.13.x before 1.13.12, as\nused in DBusServer in Canonical Upstart in Ubuntu 14.04 (and in some, less\ncommon, uses of dbus-daemon), allows cookie spoofing because of symlink\nmishandling in the reference implementation of DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 in the\nlibdbus library. (This only affects the DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication\nmechanism.) A malicious client with write access to its own home directory\ncould manipulate a ~/.dbus-keyrings symlink to cause a DBusServer with a\ndifferent uid to read and write in unintended locations. In the worst case,\nthis could result in the DBusServer reusing a cookie that is known to the\nmalicious client, and treating that cookie as evidence that a subsequent\nclient connection came from an attacker-chosen uid, allowing authentication\nbypass (CVE-2019-12749). \n",
