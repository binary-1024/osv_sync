As an experimental feature, Bison can also generate IELR(1) or canonical LR(1) parser tables. Once you are proficient with Bison, you can use it to develop a wide range of language parsers, from those used in simple desk calculators to complex programming languages.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nGNU Bison before 3.7.1 has a use-after-free in _obstack_free in lib/obstack.c (called from gram_lex) when a &apos;\\0&apos; byte is encountered. NOTE: there is a risk only if Bison is used with untrusted input, and the observed bug happens to cause unsafe behavior with a specific compiler/architecture. The bug report was intended to show that a crash may occur in Bison itself, not that a crash may occur in code that is generated by Bison.(CVE-2020-24240)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"bison","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/bison&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.4-2.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["bison-debuginfo-3.6.4-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","bison-debugsource-3.6.4-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","bison-lang-3.6.4-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","bison-devel-3.6.4-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","bison-3.6.4-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["bison-help-3.6.4-2.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["bison-3.6.4-2.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["bison-3.6.4-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bison-devel-3.6.4-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bison-lang-3.6.4-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bison-debugsource-3.6.4-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bison-debuginfo-3.6.4-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1767.json"}},{"package":{"name":"bison","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/bison&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.4-3.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["bison-debuginfo-3.6.4-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","bison-3.6.4-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","bison-debugsource-3.6.4-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","bison-devel-3.6.4-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","bison-lang-3.6.4-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["bison-help-3.6.4-3.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["bison-3.6.4-3.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["bison-debuginfo-3.6.4-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bison-devel-3.6.4-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bison-3.6.4-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bison-lang-3.6.4-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bison-debugsource-3.6.4-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1767.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2022-1767"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24240"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
