Due to an inefficient algorithm in libtasn1, decoding certain DER-encoded certificate data can take excessive time, leading to increased resource consumption. This flaw allows a remote attacker to send a specially crafted certificate, causing GnuTLS to become unresponsive or slow, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gnutls28","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gnutls28?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.1-5+deb11u7"}]}],"versions":["3.7.1-5","3.7.1-5+deb11u1","3.7.1-5+deb11u2","3.7.1-5+deb11u3","3.7.1-5+deb11u4","3.7.1-5+deb11u5","3.7.1-5+deb11u6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-12243.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnutls28","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gnutls28?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.9-2+deb12u4"}]}],"versions":["3.7.9-2","3.7.9-2+deb12u1","3.7.9-2+deb12u2","3.7.9-2+deb12u3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-12243.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnutls28","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gnutls28?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.8.9-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-12243.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnutls28","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gnutls28?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.8.9-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-12243.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-12243"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
