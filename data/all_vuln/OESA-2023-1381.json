This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2023-1073)\r\n\r\nA memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel&apos;s Stream Control Transmission Protocol. This issue may occur when a user starts a malicious networking service and someone connects to this service. This could allow a local user to starve resources, causing a denial of service.(CVE-2023-1074)\r\n\r\nIn nf_tables_updtable, if nf_tables_table_enable returns an error, nft_trans_destroy is called to free the transaction object. nft_trans_destroy() calls list_del(), but the transaction was never placed on a list -- the list head is all zeroes, this results in a NULL pointer dereference.(CVE-2023-1095)\r\n\r\nA use-after-free flaw was found in r592_remove in drivers/memstick/host/r592.c in media access in the Linux Kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker to crash the system at device disconnect, possibly leading to a kernel information leak.(CVE-2023-3141)\r\n\r\nAn out of bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel in relay_file_read_start_pos in kernel/relay.c in the relayfs. This flaw could allow a local attacker to crash the system or leak kernel internal information.(CVE-2023-3268)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.2.
