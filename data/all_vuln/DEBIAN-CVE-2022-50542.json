{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50542","published":"2025-10-07T16:15:38Z","modified":"2025-10-08T09:06:18.651474Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-50542"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: si470x: Fix use-after-free in si470x_int_in_callback()  syzbot reported use-after-free in si470x_int_in_callback() [1].  This indicates that urb->context, which contains struct si470x_device object, is freed when si470x_int_in_callback() is called.  The cause of this issue is that si470x_int_in_callback() is called for freed urb.  si470x_usb_driver_probe() calls si470x_start_usb(), which then calls usb_submit_urb() and si470x_start().  If si470x_start_usb() fails, si470x_usb_driver_probe() doesn't kill urb, but it just frees struct si470x_device object, as depicted below:  si470x_usb_driver_probe()   ...   si470x_start_usb()     ...     usb_submit_urb()     retval = si470x_start()     return retval   if (retval < 0)     free struct si470x_device object, but don't kill urb  This patch fixes this issue by killing urb when si470x_start_usb() fails and urb is submitted.  If si470x_start_usb() fails and urb is not submitted, i.e. submitting usb fails, it just frees struct si470x_device object.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.178-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.103-1","5.10.103-1~bpo10+1","5.10.106-1","5.10.113-1","5.10.120-1","5.10.120-1~bpo10+1","5.10.127-1","5.10.127-2","5.10.127-2~bpo10+1","5.10.136-1","5.10.140-1","5.10.148-1","5.10.149-1","5.10.149-2","5.10.158-1","5.10.158-2","5.10.162-1","5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1","5.10.92-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50542.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.4-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50542.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.4-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50542.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.4-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50542.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-50542"}]}
