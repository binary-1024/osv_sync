As a result, the system tries to lock the mutex whole holding\nthe spinlock.\n\nIt seems, the internal regmap locks are not needed in this driver at all.\nmcp-&gt;lock seems to protect the regmap from concurrent accesses already,\nexcept, probably, in mcp_pinconf_get/set.\n\nmcp23s08_irq_set_type() and mcp23s08_irq_mask/unmask() are called under\nchip_bus_lock(), which calls mcp23s08_irq_bus_lock(). The latter takes\nmcp-&gt;lock and enables regmap caching, so that the potentially slow I2C\naccesses are deferred until chip_bus_unlock().\n\nThe accesses to the regmap from mcp23s08_probe_one() do not need additional\nlocking.\n\nIn all remaining places where the regmap is accessed, except\nmcp_pinconf_get/set(), the driver already takes mcp-&gt;lock.\n\nThis patch adds locking in mcp_pinconf_get/set() and disables internal\nlocking in the regmap config. Among other things, it fixes the sleeping\nin atomic context described above.(CVE-2024-57889)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/smaps: fix race between smaps_hugetlb_range and migration\n\nsmaps_hugetlb_range() handles the pte without holdling ptl, and may be\nconcurrenct with migration, leaing to BUG_ON in pfn_swap_entry_to_page(). \nThe race is as follows.\n\nsmaps_hugetlb_range              migrate_pages\n  huge_ptep_get\n                                   remove_migration_ptes\n\t\t\t\t   folio_unlock\n  pfn_swap_entry_folio\n    BUG_ON\n\nTo fix it, hold ptl lock in smaps_hugetlb_range().(CVE-2025-39754)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kernel","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/kernel&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["bpftool-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-devel-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-headers-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-source-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","perf-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["kernel-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["bpftool-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-devel-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-headers-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-source-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","perf-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-6.6.0-111.0.0.114.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2410.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2410"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-57889"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-39754"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
