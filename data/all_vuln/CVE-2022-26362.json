  "details": "x86 pv: Race condition in typeref acquisition Xen maintains a type reference count for pages, in addition to a regular reference count. This scheme is used to maintain invariants required for Xen's safety, e.g. PV guests may not have direct writeable access to pagetables; updates need auditing by Xen. Unfortunately, the logic for acquiring a type reference has a race condition, whereby a safely TLB flush is issued too early and creates a window where the guest can re-establish the read/write mapping before writeability is prohibited.",
