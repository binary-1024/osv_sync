This may cause the template parser to improperly interpret the contents of &lt;script&gt; contexts, causing actions to be improperly escaped. This may be leveraged to perform an XSS attack.(CVE-2023-39318)\r\n\r\nThe html/template package does not apply the proper rules for handling occurrences of &quot;&lt;script&quot;, &quot;&lt;!--&quot;, and &quot;&lt;/script&quot; within JS literals in &lt;script&gt; contexts. This may cause the template parser to improperly consider script contexts to be terminated early, causing actions to be improperly escaped. This could be leveraged to perform an XSS attack.(CVE-2023-39319)\r\n\r\nLine directives (&quot;//line&quot;) can be used to bypass the restrictions on &quot;//go:cgo_&quot; directives, allowing blocked linker and compiler flags to be passed during compilation. This can result in unexpected execution of arbitrary code when running &quot;go build&quot;. The line directive requires the absolute path of the file in which the directive lives, which makes exploiting this issue significantly more complex.(CVE-2023-39323)\r\n\r\nA malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.(CVE-2023-39325)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"golang","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/golang&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.15.7-36.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["golang-1.15.7-36.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["golang-devel-1.15.7-36.oe1.noarch.rpm","golang-help-1.15.7-36.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["golang-1.15.7-36.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["golang-1.15.7-36.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2023-1789.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/golang&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.15.7-36.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["golang-1.15.7-36.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["golang-help-1.15.7-36.oe1.noarch.rpm","golang-devel-1.15.7-36.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["golang-1.15.7-36.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["golang-1.15.7-36.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2023-1789.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/golang&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.17.3-25.oe2203sp2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["golang-1.17.3-25.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","golang-1.17.3-25.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","golang-1.17.3-25.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["golang-help-1.17.3-25.oe2203.noarch.rpm","golang-devel-1.17.3-25.oe2203.noarch.rpm","golang-devel-1.17.3-25.oe2203sp1.noarch.rpm","golang-help-1.17.3-25.oe2203sp1.noarch.rpm","golang-devel-1.17.3-25.oe2203sp2.noarch.rpm","golang-help-1.17.3-25.oe2203sp2.noarch.rpm"],"src":["golang-1.17.3-25.oe2203.src.rpm","golang-1.17.3-25.oe2203sp1.src.rpm","golang-1.17.3-25.oe2203sp2.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["golang-1.17.3-25.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","golang-1.17.3-25.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","golang-1.17.3-25.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2023-1789.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/golang&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.17.3-25.oe2203sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["golang-1.17.3-25.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["golang-devel-1.17.3-25.oe2203sp1.noarch.rpm","golang-help-1.17.3-25.oe2203sp1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["golang-1.17.3-25.oe2203sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["golang-1.17.3-25.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2023-1789.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/golang&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.17.3-25.oe2203sp2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["golang-1.17.3-25.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["golang-devel-1.17.3-25.oe2203sp2.noarch.rpm","golang-help-1.17.3-25.oe2203sp2.noarch.rpm"],"src":["golang-1.17.3-25.oe2203sp2.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["golang-1.17.3-25.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2023-1789.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2023-1789"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39318"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39319"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39323"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39325"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
