A privileged guest user could use this flaw to\nmount a denial of service (QEMU process crash). (CVE-2015-5278)\n\nQinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered a heap buffer overflow flaw in\nthe NE2000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to\nmount a denial of service (QEMU process crash), or potentially to execute\narbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the hosting QEMU\nprocess. (CVE-2015-5279)\n\nA flaw has been discovered in the QEMU emulator built with Virtual Network\nDevice(virtio-net) support. If the guest's virtio-net driver did not\nsupport big or mergeable receive buffers, an issue could occur while\nreceiving large packets over the tuntap/ macvtap interfaces. An attacker\non the local network could use this flaw to disable the guest's\nnetworking; the user could send a large number of jumbo frames to the\nguest, which could exhaust all receive buffers, and lead to a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2015-7295)\n",
