When using the get_post_logout_redirect and get_post_login_redirect functions, it is possible to bypass URL validation and redirect a user to an arbitrary URL by providing multiple back slashes such as \\\\\\evil.com/path. This vulnerability is only exploitable if an alternative WSGI server other than Werkzeug is used, or the default behaviour of Werkzeug is modified using 'autocorrect_location_header=False. **Note:** Flask-Security is not maintained anymore.","references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/mattupstate/flask-security"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-FLASKSECURITY-1293234"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://snyk.io/blog/url-confusion-vulnerabilities/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00034.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
