This can currently happen in imgu_subdev_set_selection() when the state passed in is NULL, as this method first gets pointers to both the \"try\" and \"active\" states and only then decides which to use.  The same issue has been addressed for imgu_subdev_get_selection() with commit 30d03a0de650 (\"ipu3-imgu: Fix NULL pointer dereference in active selection access\"). However the issue still persists in imgu_subdev_set_selection().  Therefore, apply a similar fix as done in the aforementioned commit to imgu_subdev_set_selection(). To keep things a bit cleaner, introduce helper functions for \"crop\" and \"compose\" access and use them in both imgu_subdev_set_selection() and imgu_subdev_get_selection().","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.4-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50826.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.4-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50826.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.4-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50826.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-50826"}]}
