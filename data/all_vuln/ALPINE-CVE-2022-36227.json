NOTE: the discoverer cites this CWE-476 remark but third parties dispute the code-execution impact: \"In rare circumstances, when NULL is equivalent to the 0x0 memory address and privileged code can access it, then writing or reading memory is possible, which may lead to code execution.\"","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libarchive","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libarchive?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.5.3-r1"}]}],"versions":["2.8.4-r0","2.8.4-r1","2.8.4-r2","2.8.5-r0","3.0.2-r0","3.0.3-r0","3.0.4-r0","3.1.2-r0","3.1.2-r1","3.1.2-r2","3.2.0-r0","3.2.1-r0","3.2.1-r1","3.2.2-r0","3.2.2-r1","3.3.1-r0","3.3.1-r1","3.3.2-r0","3.3.2-r1","3.3.2-r2","3.3.2-r3","3.3.2-r4","3.3.3-r0","3.4.0-r0","3.4.1-r0","3.4.2-r0","3.4.3-r0","3.5.0-r0","3.5.1-r0","3.5.2-r0","3.5.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-36227.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libarchive","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libarchive?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.1-r1"}]}],"versions":["2.8.4-r0","2.8.4-r1","2.8.4-r2","2.8.5-r0","3.0.2-r0","3.0.3-r0","3.0.4-r0","3.1.2-r0","3.1.2-r1","3.1.2-r2","3.2.0-r0","3.2.1-r0","3.2.1-r1","3.2.2-r0","3.2.2-r1","3.3.1-r0","3.3.1-r1","3.3.2-r0","3.3.2-r1","3.3.2-r2","3.3.2-r3","3.3.2-r4","3.3.3-r0","3.4.0-r0","3.4.1-r0","3.4.2-r0","3.4.3-r0","3.5.0-r0","3.5.1-r0","3.5.2-r0","3.5.2-r1","3.5.2-r2","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-36227.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libarchive","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libarchive?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.1-r1"}]}],"versions":["2.8.4-r0","2.8.4-r1","2.8.4-r2","2.8.5-r0","3.0.2-r0","3.0.3-r0","3.0.4-r0","3.1.2-r0","3.1.2-r1","3.1.2-r2","3.2.0-r0","3.2.1-r0","3.2.1-r1","3.2.2-r0","3.2.2-r1","3.3.1-r0","3.3.1-r1","3.3.2-r0","3.3.2-r1","3.3.2-r2","3.3.2-r3","3.3.2-r4","3.3.3-r0","3.4.0-r0","3.4.1-r0","3.4.2-r0","3.4.3-r0","3.5.0-r0","3.5.1-r0","3.5.2-r0","3.5.2-r1","3.5.2-r2","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-36227.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libarchive","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libarchive?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.1-r2"}]}],"versions":["2.8.4-r0","2.8.4-r1","2.8.4-r2","2.8.5-r0","3.0.2-r0","3.0.3-r0","3.0.4-r0","3.1.2-r0","3.1.2-r1","3.1.2-r2","3.2.0-r0","3.2.1-r0","3.2.1-r1","3.2.2-r0","3.2.2-r1","3.3.1-r0","3.3.1-r1","3.3.2-r0","3.3.2-r1","3.3.2-r2","3.3.2-r3","3.3.2-r4","3.3.3-r0","3.4.0-r0","3.4.1-r0","3.4.2-r0","3.4.3-r0","3.5.0-r0","3.5.1-r0","3.5.2-r0","3.5.2-r1","3.5.2-r2","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.1-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-36227.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libarchive","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libarchive?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.1-r2"}]}],"versions":["2.8.4-r0","2.8.4-r1","2.8.4-r2","2.8.5-r0","3.0.2-r0","3.0.3-r0","3.0.4-r0","3.1.2-r0","3.1.2-r1","3.1.2-r2","3.2.0-r0","3.2.1-r0","3.2.1-r1","3.2.2-r0","3.2.2-r1","3.3.1-r0","3.3.1-r1","3.3.2-r0","3.3.2-r1","3.3.2-r2","3.3.2-r3","3.3.2-r4","3.3.3-r0","3.4.0-r0","3.4.1-r0","3.4.2-r0","3.4.3-r0","3.5.0-r0","3.5.1-r0","3.5.2-r0","3.5.2-r1","3.5.2-r2","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.1-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-36227.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libarchive","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libarchive?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.1-r2"}]}],"versions":["2.8.4-r0","2.8.4-r1","2.8.4-r2","2.8.5-r0","3.0.2-r0","3.0.3-r0","3.0.4-r0","3.1.2-r0","3.1.2-r1","3.1.2-r2","3.2.0-r0","3.2.1-r0","3.2.1-r1","3.2.2-r0","3.2.2-r1","3.3.1-r0","3.3.1-r1","3.3.2-r0","3.3.2-r1","3.3.2-r2","3.3.2-r3","3.3.2-r4","3.3.3-r0","3.4.0-r0","3.4.1-r0","3.4.2-r0","3.4.3-r0","3.5.0-r0","3.5.1-r0","3.5.2-r0","3.5.2-r1","3.5.2-r2","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.1-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-36227.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libarchive","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libarchive?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.1-r2"}]}],"versions":["2.8.4-r0","2.8.4-r1","2.8.4-r2","2.8.5-r0","3.0.2-r0","3.0.3-r0","3.0.4-r0","3.1.2-r0","3.1.2-r1","3.1.2-r2","3.2.0-r0","3.2.1-r0","3.2.1-r1","3.2.2-r0","3.2.2-r1","3.3.1-r0","3.3.1-r1","3.3.2-r0","3.3.2-r1","3.3.2-r2","3.3.2-r3","3.3.2-r4","3.3.3-r0","3.4.0-r0","3.4.1-r0","3.4.2-r0","3.4.3-r0","3.5.0-r0","3.5.1-r0","3.5.2-r0","3.5.2-r1","3.5.2-r2","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.1-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-36227.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libarchive","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libarchive?arch=
