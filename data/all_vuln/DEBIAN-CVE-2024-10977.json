For example, a man-in-the-middle attacker could send a long error message that a human or screen-scraper user of psql mistakes for valid query results.  This is probably not a concern for clients where the user interface unambiguously indicates the boundary between one error message and other text.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14, 13.17, and 12.21 are affected.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"postgresql-13","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/postgresql-13?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"13.17-0+deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["13.10-0+deb11u1","13.11-0+deb11u1","13.12-0+deb11u1","13.13-0+deb11u1","13.14-0+deb11u1","13.15-0+deb11u1","13.16-0+deb11u1","13.3-1","13.4-0+deb11u1","13.4-1","13.4-2","13.4-3","13.5-0+deb11u1","13.7-0+deb11u1","13.8-0+deb11u1","13.9-0+deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-10977.json"}},{"package":{"name":"postgresql-15","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/postgresql-15?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"15.9-0+deb12u1"}]}],"versions":["15.3-0+deb12u1","15.3-1","15.4-0+deb12u1","15.4-1","15.4-2","15.4-3","15.5-0+deb12u1","15.6-0+deb12u1","15.7-0+deb12u1","15.8-0+deb12u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-10977.json"}},{"package":{"name":"postgresql-17","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/postgresql-17?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"17.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-10977.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-10977"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
