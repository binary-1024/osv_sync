The selected cipher set was stored in a single \"static\" variable in the library, which has the surprising side-effect that if an application sets up multiple concurrent transfers, the last one that sets the ciphers will accidentally control the set used by all transfers. In a worst-case scenario, this weakens transport security significantly.(CVE-2021-22897)\r\n\r\ncurl 7.7 through 7.76.1 suffers from an information disclosure when the `-t` command line option, known as `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS` in libcurl, is used to send variable=content pairs to TELNET servers. Due to a flaw in the option parser for sending NEW_ENV variables, libcurl could be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based buffer to the server, resulting in potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using a clear-text network protocol.(CVE-2021-22898)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/curl&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.71.1-7.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["curl-7.71.1-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","curl-debugsource-7.71.1-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libcurl-7.71.1-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libcurl-devel-7.71.1-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","curl-debuginfo-7.71.1-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["curl-help-7.71.1-7.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["curl-7.71.1-7.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libcurl-devel-7.71.1-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","curl-debuginfo-7.71.1-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libcurl-7.71.1-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","curl-debugsource-7.71.1-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","curl-7.71.1-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1216.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1216"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22897"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22898"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
