A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data.(CVE-2021-4002)\r\n\r\nIn unix_scm_to_skb of af_unix.c, there is a possible use after free bug due to a race condition. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-196926917References: Upstream kernel(CVE-2021-0920)\r\n\r\nA vulnerability was found in the fs/inode.c:inode_init_owner() function logic of the LInux kernel that allows local users to create files for the XFS file-system with an unintended group ownership and with group execution and SGID permission bits set, in a scenario where a directory is SGID and belongs to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of this group. This can lead to excessive permissions granted in case when they should not. This vulnerability is similar to the previous CVE-2018-13405 and adds the missed fix for the XFS.(CVE-2021-4037)\r\n\r\nA race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.(CVE-2021-20321)\r\n\r\nIn __configfs_open_file of file.c, there is a possible use-after-free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-174049066References: Upstream kernel(CVE-2021-39656)\r\n\r\nIn gadget_dev_desc_UDC_show of configfs.c, there is a possible disclosure of kernel heap memory due to a race condition. This could lead to local information disclosure with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-160822094References: Upstream kernel(CVE-2021-39648)\r\n\r\nThe issue reported to the Linux security team allowed one to read and/or write up to 65kB of kernel memory past buffer boundaries by exploiting lack of limiting of the usb control transfer request wLength in certain gadget functions.(CVE-2021-39685)\r\n\r\npep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak.(CVE-2021-45095)\r\n\r\nA vulnerability was found in btrfs_alloc_tree_b in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c in the Linux kernel due to an improper lock operation in btrfs. In this flaw, a user with a local privilege may cause a denial of service (DOS) due to a deadlock problem.(CVE-2021-4149)\n\nIn the Linux kernel through 5.8.7, local attackers able to inject conntrack netlink configuration could overflow a local buffer, causing crashes or triggering use of incorrect protocol numbers in ctnetlink_parse_tuple_filter in net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_netlink.c, aka CID-1cc5ef91d2ff.(CVE-2020-25211)",
