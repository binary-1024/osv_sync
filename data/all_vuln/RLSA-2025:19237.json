It is often referred to as a data-structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. For performance, Redis works with an in-memory data set. You can persist it either by dumping the data set to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* redis: Lua library commands may lead to integer overflow and potential RCE (CVE-2025-46817)\n\n* Redis: Redis: Authenticated users can execute LUA scripts as a different user (CVE-2025-46818)\n\n* Redis: Redis is vulnerable to DoS via specially crafted LUA scripts (CVE-2025-46819)\n\n* Redis: Redis Lua Use-After-Free may lead to remote code execution (CVE-2025-49844)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"redis","ecosystem":"Rocky Linux:9","purl":"pkg:rpm/rocky-linux/redis?distro=rocky-linux-9-6&epoch=0"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0:6.2.20-1.el9_6"}],"database_specific":{"yum_repository":"AppStream"}}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/resf-osv-data/RLSA-2025:19237.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:19237"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2401258"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2401292"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2401322"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2401324"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}],"credits":[{"name":"Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation"},{"name":"Red Hat"}]}
