In affected versions untrusted notebook can execute code on load. Jupyter Notebook uses a deprecated version of Google Caja to sanitize user inputs. A public Caja bypass can be used to trigger an XSS when a victim opens a malicious ipynb document in Jupyter Notebook. The XSS allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim computer using Jupyter APIs.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"jupyter-notebook","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/jupyter-notebook?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.2.0-1","6.4.12-1","6.4.12-2","6.4.12-2.1","6.4.12-2.2","6.4.13-1","6.4.13-2","6.4.13-3","6.4.13-4","6.4.13-5","6.4.3-1","6.4.4-1","6.4.5-1","6.4.5-2","6.4.5-3","6.4.5-4","6.4.8-1","6.4.8-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-32798.json"}},{"package":{"name":"jupyter-notebook","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/jupyter-notebook?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.4.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-32798.json"}},{"package":{"name":"jupyter-notebook","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/jupyter-notebook?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.4.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-32798.json"}},{"package":{"name":"jupyter-notebook","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/jupyter-notebook?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.4.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-32798.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-32798"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
