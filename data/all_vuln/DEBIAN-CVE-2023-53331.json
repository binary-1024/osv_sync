This unchecked start value means it could be outside the bounds of the buffer, leading to future access panics when written to:   sysdump_panic_event+0x3b4/0x5b8  atomic_notifier_call_chain+0x54/0x90  panic+0x1c8/0x42c  die+0x29c/0x2a8  die_kernel_fault+0x68/0x78  __do_kernel_fault+0x1c4/0x1e0  do_bad_area+0x40/0x100  do_translation_fault+0x68/0x80  do_mem_abort+0x68/0xf8  el1_da+0x1c/0xc0  __raw_writeb+0x38/0x174  __memcpy_toio+0x40/0xac  persistent_ram_update+0x44/0x12c  persistent_ram_write+0x1a8/0x1b8  ramoops_pstore_write+0x198/0x1e8  pstore_console_write+0x94/0xe0  ...  To avoid this, also check if the prz start is 0 during the initialization phase. If not, the next prz sanity check case will discover it (start > size) and zap the buffer back to a sane state.
