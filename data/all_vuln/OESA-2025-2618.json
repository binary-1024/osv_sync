It depends on and reuses most parts of PyMySQL_ . *aiomysql* tries to be like awesome aiopg_ library and preserve same api, look and feel.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\naiomysql is a library for accessing a MySQL database from the asyncio. Prior to version 0.3.0, the client-side settings are not checked before sending local files to MySQL server, which allows obtaining arbitrary files from the client using a rogue server. It is possible to create a rogue MySQL server that emulates authorization, ignores client flags and requests arbitrary files from the client by sending a LOAD_LOCAL instruction packet.
