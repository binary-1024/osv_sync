It can collect, process and ship many kinds of data in near real-time.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nFluentd collects events from various data sources and writes them to files, RDBMS, NoSQL, IaaS, SaaS, Hadoop and so on. A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in non-default configurations of Fluentd allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via specially crafted JSON payloads. Fluentd setups are only affected if the environment variable `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE` is explicitly set to `object`. Please note: The option FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE was introduced in Fluentd version 1.13.2. Earlier versions of Fluentd are not affected by this vulnerability. This issue was patched in version 1.15.3. As a workaround do not use `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE=object`.(CVE-2022-39379)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"rubygem-fluentd","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/rubygem-fluentd&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.14.5-3.oe2203sp3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"noarch":["rubygem-fluentd-1.14.5-3.oe2203sp3.noarch.rpm","rubygem-fluentd-help-1.14.5-3.oe2203sp3.noarch.rpm"],"src":["rubygem-fluentd-1.14.5-3.oe2203sp3.src.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2321.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2321"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39379"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Critical"}}
