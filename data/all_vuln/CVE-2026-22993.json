If an ethtool command that accesses the rss lut is\nattempted immediately after reset, it will result in NULL ptr\ndereference. Also, there is no need to reset the rss lut if the soft reset\ndoes not involve queue count change.\n\nAfter soft reset, set the RSS LUT to default values based on the updated\nqueue count only if the reset was a result of a queue count change and\nthe LUT was not configured by the user. In all other cases, don't touch\nthe LUT.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n** Bring the interface down (if up)\nifconfig eth1 down\n\n** update the queue count (eg., 27->20)\nethtool -L eth1 combined 20\n\n** display the RSS LUT\nethtool -x eth1\n\n[82375.558338] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000\n[82375.558373] #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n[82375.558391] #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n[82375.558408] PGD 0 P4D 0\n[82375.558421] Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI\n<snip>\n[82375.558516] RIP: 0010:idpf_get_rxfh+0x108/0x150 [idpf]\n[82375.558786] Call Trace:\n[82375.558793]  <TASK>\n[82375.558804]  rss_prepare.isra.0+0x187/0x2a0\n[82375.558827]  rss_prepare_data+0x3a/0x50\n[82375.558845]  ethnl_default_doit+0x13d/0x3e0\n[82375.558863]  genl_family_rcv_msg_doit+0x11f/0x180\n[82375.558886]  genl_rcv_msg+0x1ad/0x2b0\n[82375.558902]  ? __pfx_ethnl_default_doit+0x10/0x10\n[82375.558920]  ? __pfx_genl_rcv_msg+0x10/0x10\n[82375.558937]  netlink_rcv_skb+0x58/0x100\n[82375.558957]  genl_rcv+0x2c/0x50\n[82375.558971]  netlink_unicast+0x289/0x3e0\n[82375.558988]  netlink_sendmsg+0x215/0x440\n[82375.559005]  __sys_sendto+0x234/0x240\n[82375.559555]  __x64_sys_sendto+0x28/0x30\n[82375.560068]  x64_sys_call+0x1909/0x1da0\n[82375.560576]  do_syscall_64+0x7a/0xfa0\n[82375.561076]  ? clear_bhb_loop+0x60/0xb0\n[82375.561567]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n<snip>","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"02cbfba1add5bd9088c7d14c6b93b77a6ea8f3bb"},{"fixed":"ab92fa4dd81beaaed4e93a851f7a37c9b2d9776f"},{"fixed":"ebecca5b093895da801b3eba1a55b4ec4027d196"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.18","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5","v6.18-rc6","v6.18-rc7","v6.18.1","v6.18.2","v6.18.3","v6.18.4","v6.18.5","v6.19-rc1","v6.19-rc2","v6.19-rc3","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22993.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.18.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22993.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ab92fa4dd81beaaed4e93a851f7a37c9b2d9776f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ebecca5b093895da801b3eba1a55b4ec4027d196"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22993.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22993"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22993.json"}}
