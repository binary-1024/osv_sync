{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-24768","published":"2026-01-28T20:32:03.500Z","modified":"2026-01-29T02:54:10.995357Z","aliases":["GHSA-3hmw-8mw3-rmpj"],"summary":"NocoDB has Unvalidated Redirect in Login Flow via continueAfterSignIn Parameter","details":"NocoDB is software for building databases as spreadsheets. Prior to version 0.301.0, an unvalidated redirect (open redirect) vulnerability exists in NocoDB’s login flow due to missing validation of the `continueAfterSignIn` parameter. During authentication, NocoDB processes a user-controlled redirect value and conditionally performs client-side navigation without enforcing any restrictions on the destination’s origin, domain or protocol. This allows attackers to redirect authenticated users to arbitrary external websites after login. This vulnerability enables phishing attacks by leveraging user trust in the legitimate NocoDB login flow. While it does not directly expose credentials or bypass authentication, it increases the likelihood of credential theft through social engineering. The issue does not allow arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation, but it undermines authentication integrity. Version 0.301.0 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"046ea02f97485a2da7b98d1f0f9737bada5981b9"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.301.0"}]}}],"versions":["0.10.0","0.10.1","0.10.2","0.10.3","0.10.4","0.10.5","0.10.6","0.100.0","0.100.1","0.100.2","0.101.0","0.101.0-beta.0","0.101.2","0.104.1","0.104.2","0.104.3","0.105.0","0.105.1","0.105.2","0.105.3","0.106.0","0.106.0-beta.0","0.106.0-beta.1","0.106.1","0.107.0","0.107.0-beta.0","0.107.0-beta.1","0.107.1","0.107.2","0.107.3","0.107.4","0.107.5","0.108.0","0.108.0-beta.0","0.108.1","0.109.0","0.109.1","0.109.2","0.109.3","0.109.4","0.109.5","0.109.6","0.109.7","0.11.0","0.11.1","0.11.10","0.11.11","0.11.12","0.11.14","0.11.15","0.11.16","0.11.17","0.11.18","0.11.19","0.11.20","0.11.21","0.11.22","0.11.23","0.11.24","0.11.25","0.11.26","0.11.28","0.11.29","0.11.3","0.11.30","0.11.31","0.11.32","0.11.33","0.11.34","0.11.36","0.11.39","0.11.4","0.11.40","0.11.41","0.11.42","0.11.43","0.11.44","0.11.45","0.11.46","0.11.5","0.11.6","0.11.7","0.11.9","0.111.0","0.111.1","0.111.2","0.111.3","0.111.4","0.200.0","0.202.0","0.202.10","0.202.4","0.202.5","0.202.6","0.202.7","0.202.8","0.202.9","0.203.0","0.203.1","0.203.2","0.204.0","0.204.1","0.204.2","0.204.3","0.204.4","0.204.5","0.204.6","0.204.7","0.204.8","0.204.9","0.205.0","0.205.1","0.207.0","0.207.1","0.207.2","0.207.3","0.250.0","0.250.1","0.250.2","0.251.0","0.251.1","0.251.2","0.251.3","0.252.0","0.253.0","0.255.0","0.255.1","0.255.2","0.256.0","0.257.0","0.257.2","0.258.0","0.258.1","0.258.10","0.258.11","0.258.2","0.258.3","0.260.0","0.260.1","0.260.2","0.260.3","0.260.4","0.260.5","0.260.6","0.260.7","0.261.0","0.262.0","0.262.1","0.262.2","0.262.3","0.262.4","0.262.5","0.263.0","0.263.1","0.263.2","0.263.3","0.263.4","0.263.6","0.263.7","0.263.8","0.264.0","0.264.1","0.264.2","0.264.3","0.264.4","0.264.6","0.264.7","0.264.8","0.264.9","0.265.0","0.265.1","0.300.0","0.4.5","0.4.8","0.4.9","0.80.0","0.81.0","0.81.1","0.82.0","0.83.0","0.83.1","0.83.2","0.83.3","0.83.4","0.83.5","0.83.6","0.83.8","0.84.1","0.84.10","0.84.12","0.84.13","0.84.14","0.84.15","0.84.16","0.84.2","0.84.3","0.84.6","0.84.7","0.84.8","0.84.9","0.9","0.90.0","0.90.1","0.90.10","0.90.11","0.90.2","0.90.3","0.90.4","0.90.5","0.90.7","0.90.8","0.90.9","0.91.0","0.91.1","0.91.10","0.91.6","0.91.7","0.91.8","0.91.9","0.92.0","0.92.1","0.92.2","0.92.3","0.92.4","0.96.0","0.96.1","0.96.2","0.96.4","0.97.0","0.98.1","0.98.2","0.98.3","0.98.4","0.99.0","0.99.1","0.99.2","v0.10.0","v0.4.2","v0.4.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24768.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24768.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/security/advisories/GHSA-3hmw-8mw3-rmpj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24768"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-601"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24768.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
