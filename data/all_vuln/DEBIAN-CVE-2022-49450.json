This means that listen(rxrpc_sock, 32) will cause an oops when the socket is closed because rxrpc_service_prealloc_one() allocated one too many calls and rxrpc_discard_prealloc() won't then be able to get rid of them because it'll think the ring is empty.  rxrpc_release_calls_on_socket() then tries to abort them, but oopses because call->peer isn't yet set.  Fix this by setting the maximum backlog to RXRPC_BACKLOG_MAX - 1 to match the ring capacity.   BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000086  ...
