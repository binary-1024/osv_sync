An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the GIMP \"Despeckle\"  plug-in. The issue occurs due to unchecked multiplication of image dimensions, such as width, height, and bytes-per-pixel (img_bpp), which can result in allocating insufficient memory and subsequently performing out-of-bounds writes. This issue could lead to heap corruption, a potential denial of service (DoS), or arbitrary code execution in certain scenarios.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gimp","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gimp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.10.22-4+deb11u3"}]}],"versions":["2.10.22-4","2.10.22-4+deb11u1","2.10.22-4+deb11u2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-6035.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gimp","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gimp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.10.34-1","2.10.34-1+deb12u1","2.10.34-1+deb12u2","2.10.34-1+deb12u3","2.10.36-1","2.10.36-2","2.10.36-3","2.10.38-1","2.10.38-2","2.99.10-1","2.99.12-1","2.99.12-2","2.99.14-1","2.99.14-2","2.99.16-1","2.99.16-2","2.99.18-1","3.0.0-1","3.0.0-2","3.0.0~RC1-1","3.0.0~RC1-3","3.0.0~RC1-4","3.0.0~RC2-1","3.0.0~RC3-1","3.0.2-1","3.0.2-2","3.0.2-3","3.0.2-3.1","3.0.4-1","3.0.4-2","3.0.4-3","3.0.4-4","3.0.4-5","3.0.4-6","3.0.4-6.1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-6035.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gimp","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gimp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.0.4-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-6035.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gimp","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gimp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.0.4-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-6035.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-6035"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
