  "details": "A flaw was found in GIMP. An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the GIMP \"Despeckle\"  plug-in. The issue occurs due to unchecked multiplication of image dimensions, such as width, height, and bytes-per-pixel (img_bpp), which can result in allocating insufficient memory and subsequently performing out-of-bounds writes. This issue could lead to heap corruption, a potential denial of service (DoS), or arbitrary code execution in certain scenarios.",
