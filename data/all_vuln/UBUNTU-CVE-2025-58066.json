In versions between 1.2.0 and 1.6.1 inclusive servers which allow non-NTS traffic are affected by a denial of service vulnerability, where an attacker can induce a message storm between two NTP servers running ntpd-rs. Client-only configurations are not affected. Affected users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.6.2 as soon as possible.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"rust-ntpd","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/rust-ntpd@1.1.2-1?arch=source&distro=noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0-5","1.1.0-2","1.1.0-3","1.1.1-1","1.1.1-2","1.1.2-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"librust-ntpd-dev","binary_version":"1.1.2-1"},{"binary_name":"ntpd-rs","binary_version":"1.1.2-1"},{"binary_name":"ntpd-rs-metrics","binary_version":"1.1.2-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-58066.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rust-ntpd","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.10","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/rust-ntpd@1.4.0-6?arch=source&distro=questing"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.1.3-1build1","1.4.0-6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"librust-ntpd-dev","binary_version":"1.4.0-6"},{"binary_name":"ntpd-rs","binary_version":"1.4.0-6"},{"binary_name":"ntpd-rs-metrics","binary_version":"1.4.0-6"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-58066.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rust-ntpd","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.04","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/rust-ntpd@1.1.3-1build1?arch=source&distro=plucky"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.1.3-1build1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"librust-ntpd-dev","binary_version":"1.1.3-1build1"},{"binary_name":"ntpd-rs","binary_version":"1.1.3-1build1"},{"binary_name":"ntpd-rs-metrics","binary_version":"1.1.3-1build1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-58066.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-58066"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58066"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-4855-q42w-5vr4"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs/commit/da37cf167736cbd4d7804b1ed7ceb572468298e0"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
