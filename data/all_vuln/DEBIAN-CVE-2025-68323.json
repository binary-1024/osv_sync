{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68323","published":"2025-12-18T15:16:06.103Z","modified":"2025-12-28T05:18:29.262567Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-68323"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: typec: ucsi: fix use-after-free caused by uec->work  The delayed work uec->work is scheduled in gaokun_ucsi_probe() but never properly canceled in gaokun_ucsi_remove(). This creates use-after-free scenarios where the ucsi and gaokun_ucsi structure are freed after ucsi_destroy() completes execution, while the gaokun_ucsi_register_worker() might be either currently executing or still pending in the work queue. The already-freed gaokun_ucsi or ucsi structure may then be accessed.  Furthermore, the race window is 3 seconds, which is sufficiently long to make this bug easily reproducible.
