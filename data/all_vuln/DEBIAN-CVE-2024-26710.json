  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/kasan: Limit KASAN thread size increase to 32KB  KASAN is seen to increase stack usage, to the point that it was reported to lead to stack overflow on some 32-bit machines (see link).  To avoid overflows the stack size was doubled for KASAN builds in commit 3e8635fb2e07 (\"powerpc/kasan: Force thread size increase with KASAN\").  However with a 32KB stack size to begin with, the doubling leads to a 64KB stack, which causes build errors:   arch/powerpc/kernel/switch.S:249: Error: operand out of range (0x000000000000fe50 is not between 0xffffffffffff8000 and 0x0000000000007fff)  Although the asm could be reworked, in practice a 32KB stack seems sufficient even for KASAN builds - the additional usage seems to be in the 2-3KB range for a 64-bit KASAN build.  So only increase the stack for KASAN if the stack size is < 32KB.",
