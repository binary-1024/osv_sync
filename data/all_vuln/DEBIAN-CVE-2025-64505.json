Prior to version 1.6.51, a heap buffer over-read vulnerability exists in libpng's png_do_quantize function when processing PNG files with malformed palette indices. The vulnerability occurs when palette_lookup array bounds are not validated against externally-supplied image data, allowing an attacker to craft a PNG file with out-of-range palette indices that trigger out-of-bounds memory access. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.51.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libpng1.6","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libpng1.6?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.6.37-3+deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["1.6.37-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-64505.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libpng1.6","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libpng1.6?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.6.39-2","1.6.40-1","1.6.40-2","1.6.40-3","1.6.41-1","1.6.42-1","1.6.42-1.1~exp1","1.6.43-1","1.6.43-1exp1","1.6.43-2","1.6.43-3","1.6.43-4","1.6.43-5","1.6.44-1","1.6.44-2","1.6.44-3","1.6.45-1","1.6.46-1","1.6.46-2","1.6.46-3","1.6.46-4","1.6.47-1","1.6.47-1.1","1.6.48-1","1.6.49-1~exp1","1.6.50-1","1.6.50-1~exp1","1.6.51-1","1.6.52-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-64505.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libpng1.6","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libpng1.6?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.6.48-1","1.6.49-1~exp1","1.6.50-1","1.6.50-1~exp1","1.6.51-1","1.6.52-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-64505.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libpng1.6","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libpng1.6?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.6.51-1"}]}],"versions":["1.6.48-1","1.6.49-1~exp1","1.6.50-1","1.6.50-1~exp1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-64505.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-64505"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H"}]}
