It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++ (or other languages, depending on the chosen implementation). Python is also usable as an extension language for applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use scripting or automation interfaces.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nThere is a defect in the CPython &apos;tarfile&apos; module affecting the &apos;TarFile&apos; extraction and entry enumeration APIs. The tar implementation would process tar archives with negative offsets without error, resulting in an infinite loop and deadlock during the parsing of maliciously crafted tar archives.(CVE-2025-8194)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python3&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.9.9-42.oe2203sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python3-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-debug-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-devel-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-unversioned-command-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["python3-help-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp4.noarch.rpm"],"src":["python3-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python3-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-debug-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-devel-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-unversioned-command-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2101.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2101"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-8194"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
