  "details": "The Linux Kernel, the operating system core itself.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nthere was a null pointer dereference in llcp_sock_getname in net/nfc/llcp_sock.c and reproduced it in linux-5.13.0-rc2. An unprivileged user can trigger this bug and cause denial of service.  #Root Cause After creating an nfc socket, bind the address by calling bind(), if LLCP_SAP_MAX was used as SAP, it cause the bind() failed and there would set llcp_sock-&gt;service_name  as NULL.  Although bind() returns an error here, it does not affect calling other socket functions. sock_getname() would invoke llcp_sock_getname(), llcp_sock_getname copied service  name from llcp_sock-&gt;service_name by memcpy but llcp_sock-&gt;service_name is NULL.  #Fix the patch for this issue: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/netdev/net.git/commit/?id=4ac06a1e013c(CVE-2021-3587)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.10. drivers/infiniband/core/ucma.c has a use-after-free because the ctx is reached via the ctx_list in some ucma_migrate_id situations where ucma_close is called, aka CID-f5449e74802c.(CVE-2020-36385)\r\n\r\nThe vgacon subsystem in the Linux kernel before 5.8.10 mishandles software scrollback. There is a vgacon_scrolldelta out-of-bounds read, aka CID-973c096f6a85.(CVE-2020-28097)\r\n\r\nIn kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel before 5.12.13, a branch can be mispredicted (e.g., because of type confusion) and consequently an unprivileged BPF program can read arbitrary memory locations via a side-channel attack, aka CID-9183671af6db.(CVE-2021-33624)\r\n\r\nkernel/module.c in the Linux kernel before 5.12.14 mishandles Signature Verification, aka CID-0c18f29aae7c. Without CONFIG_MODULE_SIG, verification that a kernel module is signed, for loading via init_module, does not occur for a module.sig_enforce=1 command-line argument.(CVE-2021-35039)\r\n\r\nA heap out-of-bounds write affecting Linux since v2.6.19-rc1 was discovered in net/netfilter/x_tables.c. This allows an attacker to gain privileges or cause a DoS (via heap memory corruption) through user name space(CVE-2021-22555)\r\n\r\nA flaw use-after-free in function hci_sock_bound_ioctl() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the way user detaches bluetooth dongle or other way triggers unregister bluetooth device event. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2021-3573)\r\n\r\nImproper access control in BlueZ may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via adjacent access.(CVE-2021-0129)\r\n\r\nnet/can/bcm.c in the Linux kernel through 5.12.10 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory because parts of a data structure are uninitialized.(CVE-2021-34693)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.8.2. fs/io_uring.c has a use-after-free related to io_async_task_func and ctx reference holding, aka CID-6d816e088c35.(CVE-2020-36387)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the CAN BCM networking protocol in the Linux kernel, where a local attacker can abuse a flaw in the CAN subsystem to corrupt memory, crash the system or escalate privileges.(CVE-2021-3609)\r\n\r\nIt was discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly track bounds information for 32 bit registers when performing div and mod operations. A local attacker could use this to possibly execute arbitrary code.(CVE-2021-3600)",
