If you&apos;re using a Python version that implements PEP 706\nthen pip doesn&apos;t use the &quot;vulnerable&quot; fallback code.\n\nMitigations include upgrading to a version of pip that includes the fix, upgrading to a Python version that implements PEP 706 (Python &gt;=3.9.17, &gt;=3.10.12, &gt;=3.11.4, or &gt;=3.12),\napplying the linked patch, or inspecting source distributions (sdists) before installation as is already a best-practice.(CVE-2025-8869)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-pip","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python-pip&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"21.3.1-12.oe2203sp3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"noarch":["python-pip-help-21.3.1-12.oe2203sp3.noarch.rpm","python-pip-wheel-21.3.1-12.oe2203sp3.noarch.rpm","python3-pip-21.3.1-12.oe2203sp3.noarch.rpm"],"src":["python-pip-21.3.1-12.oe2203sp3.src.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2794.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2794"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-8869"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
