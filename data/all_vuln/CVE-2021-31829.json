The specific concern is not protecting the BPF stack area against speculative loads. Also, the BPF stack can contain uninitialized data that might represent sensitive information previously operated on by the kernel.","references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/04/4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/801c6058d14a82179a7ee17a4b532cac6fad067f"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/06/msg00019.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VWCZ6LJLENL2C3URW5ICARTACXPFCFN2/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Y4X2G5YAPYJGI3PFEZZNOTRYI33GOCCZ/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZI7OBCJQDNWMKLBP6MZ5NV4EUTDAMX6Q/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
