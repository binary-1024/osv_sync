  "details": "mod_proxy_wstunnel tunneling of non Upgraded connections: Apache HTTP Server \nversions 2.4.6 to 2.4.46 mod_proxy_wstunnel configured on an URL that is not \nnecessarily Upgraded by the origin server was tunneling the whole connection \nregardless, thus allowing for subsequent requests on the same connection to \npass through with no HTTP validation, authentication or authorization \npossibly configured. (CVE-2019-17567).\n   \nmod_proxy_http NULL pointer dereference: Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.41 \nto 2.4.46 mod_proxy_http can be made to crash (NULL pointer dereference) with \nspecially crafted requests using both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding \nheaders, leading to a Denial of Service (CVE-2020-13950).\n\nmod_auth_digest possible stack overflow by one nul byte: Apache HTTP Server \nversions 2.4.0 to 2.4.46 A specially crafted Digest nonce can cause a stack \noverflow in mod_auth_digest. There is no report of this overflow being \nexploitable, nor the Apache HTTP Server team could create one, though some \nparticular compiler and/or compilation option might make it possible, with \nlimited consequences anyway due to the size (a single byte) and the value \n(zero byte) of the overflow (CVE-2020-35452).\n\nmod_session NULL pointer dereference: Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to \n2.4.46 A specially crafted Cookie header handled by mod_session can cause a \nNULL pointer dereference and crash, leading to a possible Denial Of Service \n(CVE-2021-26690).\n\nmod_session response handling heap overflow: Apache HTTP Server versions \n2.4.0 to 2.4.46 A specially crafted SessionHeader sent by an origin server \ncould cause a heap overflow (CVE-2021-26691).\n\nUnexpected URL matching with 'MergeSlashes OFF': Apache HTTP Server versions \n2.4.39 to 2.4.46 Unexpected matching behavior with 'MergeSlashes \nOFF'(CVE-2021-30641).\n\nNULL pointer dereference on specially crafted HTTP/2 request: Apache HTTP \nServer protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks received request \nheaders against the size limitations as configured for the server and used \nfor the HTTP/1 protocol as well. On violation of these restrictions and HTTP \nresponse is sent to the client with a status code indicating why the request \nwas rejected. This rejection response was not fully initialised in the HTTP/2 \nprotocol handler if the offending header was the very first one received or \nappeared in a a footer. This led to a NULL pointer dereference on initialised \nmemory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 \nrequest is easy to craft and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server. \nThis issue affected mod_http2 1.15.17 and Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47 \nonly. Apache HTTP Server 2.4.47 was never released. (CVE-2021-31618).\n",
