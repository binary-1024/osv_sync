Prior to versions 1.13.5 and 1.14.0, it may happen that policy rules using namespace selector(s) in their match statements are mistakenly not applied during admission review request processing due to a missing error propagation in function `GetNamespaceSelectorsFromNamespaceLister` in `pkg/utils/engine/labels.go`. As a consequence, security-critical mutations and validations are bypassed, potentially allowing attackers with K8s API access to perform malicious operations. This issue has been patched in versions 1.13.5 and 1.14.0.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kyverno","ecosystem":"Bitnami","purl":"pkg:bitnami/kyverno"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.13.5"},{"introduced":"1.14.0-alpha.1"},{"fixed":"1.14.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/bitnami/vulndb/tree/main/data/kyverno/BIT-kyverno-2025-46342.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H"}]}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/commit/3ff923b7756e1681daf73849954bd88516589194"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/security/advisories/GHSA-jrr2-x33p-6hvc"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46342"}],"database_specific":{"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:kyverno:kyverno:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"severity":"High"}}
