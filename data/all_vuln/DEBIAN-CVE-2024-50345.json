The `Request` class, does not parse URI with special characters the same way browsers do. As a result, an attacker can trick a validator relying on the `Request` class to redirect users to another domain. The `Request::create` methods now assert the URI does not contain invalid characters as defined by https://url.spec.whatwg.org/. This issue has been patched in versions 5.4.46, 6.4.14, and 7.1.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"symfony","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/symfony?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.4.19+dfsg-2+deb11u7"}]}],"versions":["4.4.19+dfsg-2","4.4.19+dfsg-2+deb11u1","4.4.19+dfsg-2+deb11u2","4.4.19+dfsg-2+deb11u3","4.4.19+dfsg-2+deb11u4","4.4.19+dfsg-2+deb11u5","4.4.19+dfsg-2+deb11u6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-50345.json"}},{"package":{"name":"symfony","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/symfony?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.4.23+dfsg-1+deb12u3"}]}],"versions":["5.4.23+dfsg-1","5.4.23+dfsg-1+deb12u1","5.4.23+dfsg-1+deb12u2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-50345.json"}},{"package":{"name":"symfony","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/symfony?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.4.14+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-50345.json"}},{"package":{"name":"symfony","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/symfony?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.4.14+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-50345.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-50345"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
