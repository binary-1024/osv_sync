RSI is specified in the bitmap of those registers, but it is missing when zeroing out those registers in the current TDX_HYPERCALL.  It was there when it was originally added in commit 752d13305c78 (\"x86/tdx: Expand __tdx_hypercall() to handle more arguments\"), but was later removed in commit 1e70c680375a (\"x86/tdx: Do not corrupt frame-pointer in __tdx_hypercall()\"), which was correct because %rsi is later restored in the \"pop %rsi\".  However a later commit 7a3a401874be (\"x86/tdx: Drop flags from __tdx_hypercall()\") removed that \"pop %rsi\" but forgot to add the \"xor %rsi, %rsi\" back.  Fix by adding it back.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.6.8-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-52874.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.6.8-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-52874.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-52874"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
