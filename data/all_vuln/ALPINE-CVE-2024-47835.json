{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2024-47835","published":"2024-12-12T02:03:43Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:28:39.886270Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-47835"],"details":"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A null pointer dereference vulnerability has been detected in the parse_lrc function within gstsubparse.c. The parse_lrc function calls strchr() to find the character ']' in the string line. The pointer returned by this call is then passed to g_strdup(). However, if the string line does not contain the character ']', strchr() returns NULL, and a call to g_strdup(start + 1) leads to a null pointer dereference. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-base","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gst-plugins-base?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.24.10-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0-r0","1.0.1-r0","1.0.10-r0","1.0.2-r0","1.0.3-r0","1.0.4-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.6-r0","1.0.7-r0","1.0.8-r0","1.0.9-r0","1.10.4-r0","1.10.4-r1","1.12.0-r0","1.12.1-r0","1.12.1-r1","1.12.1-r2","1.12.3-r0","1.12.3-r1","1.14.0-r0","1.14.0-r1","1.14.1-r0","1.14.2-r0","1.14.4-r0","1.16.0-r0","1.16.1-r0","1.16.2-r0","1.16.2-r1","1.16.2-r2","1.16.2-r3","1.18.1-r0","1.18.2-r0","1.18.3-r0","1.18.4-r0","1.18.4-r1","1.18.5-r0","1.18.6-r0","1.2.0-r0","1.2.1-r0","1.2.2-r0","1.2.3-r0","1.2.4-r0","1.20.1-r0","1.20.2-r0","1.20.3-r0","1.20.3-r1","1.20.4-r0","1.20.4-r1","1.20.5-r0","1.22.0-r0","1.22.0-r1","1.22.1-r0","1.22.1-r1","1.22.11-r0","1.22.2-r0","1.22.3-r0","1.22.4-r0","1.22.5-r0","1.22.6-r0","1.22.7-r0","1.22.8-r0","1.24.3-r0","1.24.9-r0","1.4.0-r0","1.4.1-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.4.3-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.6.1-r0","1.6.3-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.8.1-r0","1.8.1-r1","1.8.1-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-47835.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-base","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gst-plugins-base?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.24.10-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0-r0","1.0.1-r0","1.0.10-r0","1.0.2-r0","1.0.3-r0","1.0.4-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.6-r0","1.0.7-r0","1.0.8-r0","1.0.9-r0","1.10.4-r0","1.10.4-r1","1.12.0-r0","1.12.1-r0","1.12.1-r1","1.12.1-r2","1.12.3-r0","1.12.3-r1","1.14.0-r0","1.14.0-r1","1.14.1-r0","1.14.2-r0","1.14.4-r0","1.16.0-r0","1.16.1-r0","1.16.2-r0","1.16.2-r1","1.16.2-r2","1.16.2-r3","1.18.1-r0","1.18.2-r0","1.18.3-r0","1.18.4-r0","1.18.4-r1","1.18.5-r0","1.18.6-r0","1.2.0-r0","1.2.1-r0","1.2.2-r0","1.2.3-r0","1.2.4-r0","1.20.1-r0","1.20.2-r0","1.20.3-r0","1.20.3-r1","1.20.4-r0","1.20.4-r1","1.20.5-r0","1.22.0-r0","1.22.0-r1","1.22.1-r0","1.22.1-r1","1.22.11-r0","1.22.2-r0","1.22.3-r0","1.22.4-r0","1.22.5-r0","1.22.6-r0","1.22.7-r0","1.22.8-r0","1.24.3-r0","1.24.4-r0","1.24.5-r0","1.24.7-r0","1.24.8-r0","1.24.9-r0","1.4.0-r0","1.4.1-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.4.3-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.6.1-r0","1.6.3-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.8.1-r0","1.8.1-r1","1.8.1-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-47835.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-base","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gst-plugins-base?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.24.10-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0-r0","1.0.1-r0","1.0.10-r0","1.0.2-r0","1.0.3-r0","1.0.4-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.6-r0","1.0.7-r0","1.0.8-r0","1.0.9-r0","1.10.4-r0","1.10.4-r1","1.12.0-r0","1.12.1-r0","1.12.1-r1","1.12.1-r2","1.12.3-r0","1.12.3-r1","1.14.0-r0","1.14.0-r1","1.14.1-r0","1.14.2-r0","1.14.4-r0","1.16.0-r0","1.16.1-r0","1.16.2-r0","1.16.2-r1","1.16.2-r2","1.16.2-r3","1.18.1-r0","1.18.2-r0","1.18.3-r0","1.18.4-r0","1.18.4-r1","1.18.5-r0","1.18.6-r0","1.2.0-r0","1.2.1-r0","1.2.2-r0","1.2.3-r0","1.2.4-r0","1.20.1-r0","1.20.2-r0","1.20.3-r0","1.20.3-r1","1.20.4-r0","1.20.4-r1","1.20.5-r0","1.22.0-r0","1.22.0-r1","1.22.1-r0","1.22.1-r1","1.22.11-r0","1.22.2-r0","1.22.3-r0","1.22.4-r0","1.22.5-r0","1.22.6-r0","1.22.7-r0","1.22.8-r0","1.24.3-r0","1.24.4-r0","1.24.5-r0","1.24.7-r0","1.24.8-r0","1.24.9-r0","1.4.0-r0","1.4.1-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.4.3-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.6.1-r0","1.6.3-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.8.1-r0","1.8.1-r1","1.8.1-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-47835.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2024-47835"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
