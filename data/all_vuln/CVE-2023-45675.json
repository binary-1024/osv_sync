{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-45675","published":"2023-10-20T23:26:45Z","modified":"2025-10-21T02:36:53Z","summary":"0 byte write heap buffer overflow in start_decoder in stb_vorbis","details":"stb_vorbis is a single file MIT licensed library for processing ogg vorbis files. A crafted file may trigger out of bounds write in `f->vendor[len] = (char)'\\0';`. The root cause is that if the len read in `start_decoder` is `-1` and `len + 1` becomes 0 when passed to `setup_malloc`. The `setup_malloc` behaves differently when `f->alloc.alloc_buffer` is pre-allocated. Instead of returning `NULL` as in `malloc` case it shifts the pre-allocated buffer by zero and returns the currently available memory block. This issue may lead to code execution.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-45675.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1.22"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-145_GHSL-2023-151_stb_image_h/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/5736b15f7ea0ffb08dd38af21067c314d6a3aae9/stb_vorbis.c#L3652-L3658"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/5736b15f7ea0ffb08dd38af21067c314d6a3aae9/stb_vorbis.c#L3658"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/5736b15f7ea0ffb08dd38af21067c314d6a3aae9/stb_vorbis.c#L950-L960"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NMXKOKPP4BKTNUTF5KSRDQAWOUILQZNO/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QVABVF4GEM6BYD5L4L64RCRSXUHY6LGN/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UVQ7ONFH5GWLMXYEAJG32A3EUKUCEVCR/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L"}]}
