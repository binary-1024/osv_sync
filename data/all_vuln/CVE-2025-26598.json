  "details": "An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in X.Org and Xwayland. The function GetBarrierDevice() searches for the pointer device based on its device ID and returns the matching value, or supposedly NULL, if no match was found. However, the code will return the last element of the list if no matching device ID is found, which can lead to out-of-bounds memory access.",
