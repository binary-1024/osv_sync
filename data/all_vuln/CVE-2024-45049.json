It is possible to trigger evaluations in Hydra without any authentication. Depending on the size of evaluations, this can impact the availability of systems. The problem can be fixed by applying https://github.com/NixOS/hydra/commit/f73043378907c2c7e44f633ad764c8bdd1c947d5 to any Hydra package. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should deny the `/api/push` route in a reverse proxy. This also breaks the \"Evaluate jobset\" button in the frontend.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-45049.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f73043378907c2c7e44f633ad764c8bdd1c947d5"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/NixOS/hydra/security/advisories/GHSA-xv29-v93r-2f5v"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/NixOS/hydra/commit/f73043378907c2c7e44f633ad764c8bdd1c947d5"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/337766"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://mastodon.delroth.net/@delroth/113029832631860419"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
