  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cxl/pmem: Fix cxl_pmem_region and cxl_memdev leak  When a cxl_nvdimm object goes through a ->remove() event (device physically removed, nvdimm-bridge disabled, or nvdimm device disabled), then any associated regions must also be disabled. As highlighted by the cxl-create-region.sh test [1], a single device may host multiple regions, but the driver was only tracking one region at a time. This leads to a situation where only the last enabled region per nvdimm device is cleaned up properly. Other regions are leaked, and this also causes cxl_memdev reference leaks.  Fix the tracking by allowing cxl_nvdimm objects to track multiple region associations.",
