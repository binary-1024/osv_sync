{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-26698","published":"2024-04-03T15:15:52Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:18:13.660236Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-26698"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  hv_netvsc: Fix race condition between netvsc_probe and netvsc_remove  In commit ac5047671758 (\"hv_netvsc: Disable NAPI before closing the VMBus channel\"), napi_disable was getting called for all channels, including all subchannels without confirming if they are enabled or not.  This caused hv_netvsc getting hung at napi_disable, when netvsc_probe() has finished running but nvdev->subchan_work has not started yet. netvsc_subchan_work() -> rndis_set_subchannel() has not created the sub-channels and because of that netvsc_sc_open() is not running. netvsc_remove() calls cancel_work_sync(&nvdev->subchan_work), for which netvsc_subchan_work did not run.  netif_napi_add() sets the bit NAPI_STATE_SCHED because it ensures NAPI cannot be scheduled. Then netvsc_sc_open() -> napi_enable will clear the NAPIF_STATE_SCHED bit, so it can be scheduled. napi_disable() does the opposite.  Now during netvsc_device_remove(), when napi_disable is called for those subchannels, napi_disable gets stuck on infinite msleep.  This fix addresses this problem by ensuring that napi_disable() is not getting called for non-enabled NAPI struct. But netif_napi_del() is still necessary for these non-enabled NAPI struct for cleanup purpose.
