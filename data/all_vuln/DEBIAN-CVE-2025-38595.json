  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xen: fix UAF in dmabuf_exp_from_pages()  [dma_buf_fd() fixes; no preferences regarding the tree it goes through - up to xen folks]  As soon as we'd inserted a file reference into descriptor table, another thread could close it.  That's fine for the case when all we are doing is returning that descriptor to userland (it's a race, but it's a userland race and there's nothing the kernel can do about it).  However, if we follow fd_install() with any kind of access to objects that would be destroyed on close (be it the struct file itself or anything destroyed by its ->release()), we have a UAF.  dma_buf_fd() is a combination of reserving a descriptor and fd_install(). gntdev dmabuf_exp_from_pages() calls it and then proceeds to access the objects destroyed on close - starting with gntdev_dmabuf itself.  Fix that by doing reserving descriptor before anything else and do fd_install() only when everything had been set up.",
