  "details": "An issue was discovered in ezXML 0.8.2 through 0.8.6. The function ezxml_str2utf8, while parsing a crafted XML file, performs zero-length reallocation in ezxml.c, leading to returning a NULL pointer (in some compilers). After this, the function ezxml_parse_str does not check whether the s variable is not NULL in ezxml.c, leading to a NULL pointer dereference and crash (segmentation fault).",
