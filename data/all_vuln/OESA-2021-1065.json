{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"OESA-2021-1065","published":"2021-03-05T11:02:40Z","modified":"2025-09-03T06:17:11.590384Z","upstream":["CVE-2020-7069","CVE-2020-7070"],"summary":"php security update","details":"PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. PHP attempts to make it easy for developers to write dynamically generated web pages. PHP also offers built-in database integration for several commercial and non-commercial database management systems, so writing a database-enabled webpage with PHP is fairly simple. The most common use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI scripts. The php package contains the module (often referred to as mod_php) which adds support for the PHP language to Apache HTTP Server.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nIn PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.34, 7.3.x below 7.3.23 and 7.4.x below 7.4.11, when PHP is processing incoming HTTP cookie values, the cookie names are url-decoded. This may lead to cookies with prefixes like __Host confused with cookies that decode to such prefix, thus leading to an attacker being able to forge cookie which is supposed to be secure. See also CVE-2020-8184 for more information.(CVE-2020-7070)\r\n\r\nIn PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.34, 7.3.x below 7.3.23 and 7.4.x below 7.4.11, when AES-CCM mode is used with openssl_encrypt() function with 12 bytes IV, only first 7 bytes of the IV is actually used. This can lead to both decreased security and incorrect encryption data.(CVE-2020-7069)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"php","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/php&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.2.10-12.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["php-snmp-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-help-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-pgsql-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-process-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-dbg-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-bcmath-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-common-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-dba-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-embedded-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-odbc-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-debuginfo-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-mysqlnd-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-mbstring-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-opcache-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-recode-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-debugsource-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-xmlrpc-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-ldap-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-xml-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-fpm-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-tidy-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-gd-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-gmp-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-json-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-devel-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-cli-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-pdo-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-enchant-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-soap-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","php-intl-7.2.10-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["php-7.2.10-12.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["php-help-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-dbg-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-devel-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-opcache-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-pdo-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-gd-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-gmp-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-process-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-mbstring-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-soap-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-embedded-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-odbc-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-snmp-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-tidy-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-debuginfo-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-common-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-enchant-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-bcmath-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-json-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-cli-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-fpm-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-intl-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-debugsource-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-dba-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-xml-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-pgsql-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-recode-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-mysqlnd-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-xmlrpc-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","php-ldap-7.2.10-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1065.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1065"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7070"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7069"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
