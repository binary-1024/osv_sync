In versions 0.0.15 and below, an attacker may inject content with ASCII control characters like vertical tabs, ANSI escape sequences, etc., that can create misleading output of the badkeys command-line tool. This impacts scanning DKIM keys (both --dkim and --dkim-dns), SSH keys (--ssh-lines mode), and filenames in various modes. This issue is fixed in version 0.0.16.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/badkeys/badkeys","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e14ecc2f18fbb9bfb0b8b8e170dc10ae55a01212"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.10","v0.0.11","v0.0.12","v0.0.13","v0.0.14","v0.0.15","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-21439.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/21xxx/CVE-2026-21439.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/badkeys/badkeys/commit/635a2f3b1b50a895d8b09ec8629efc06189f349a"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/badkeys/badkeys/commit/de631f69f040974bb5fb442cdab9a1d904c64087"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/badkeys/badkeys/issues/40"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/badkeys/badkeys/security/advisories/GHSA-wjpc-4f29-83h3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-21439"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-150"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/21xxx/CVE-2026-21439.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
