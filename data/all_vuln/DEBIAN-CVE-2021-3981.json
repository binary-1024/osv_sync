This represents a low severity confidentiality issue, as those users can eventually read any encrypted passwords present in grub.cfg. This flaw affects grub2 2.06 and previous versions. This issue has been fixed in grub upstream but no version with the fix is currently released.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"grub2","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/grub2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.04-20","2.06-1","2.06-10","2.06-11","2.06-12","2.06-13","2.06-13+hurd.1","2.06-13+hurd.2","2.06-14","2.06-2","2.06-2+hurd.1","2.06-2+hurd.2","2.06-2+hurd.3","2.06-2+hurd.4","2.06-2+hurd.5","2.06-2+hurd.6","2.06-2+hurd.7","2.06-2+hurd.8","2.06-3","2.06-3~deb10u1","2.06-3~deb10u2","2.06-3~deb10u3","2.06-3~deb10u4","2.06-3~deb11u1","2.06-3~deb11u2","2.06-3~deb11u4","2.06-3~deb11u5","2.06-3~deb11u6","2.06-4","2.06-4+hurd.1","2.06-5","2.06-6","2.06-7","2.06-8","2.06-8+hurd.1","2.06-8.1","2.06-9","2.12-1","2.12-1.1","2.12-1~bpo12+1","2.12-2","2.12-2~deb13u1","2.12-3","2.12-4","2.12-5","2.12-5+hurd.1","2.12-6","2.12-7","2.12-8","2.12-9","2.12-9+hurd.1","2.12~rc1-1","2.12~rc1-10","2.12~rc1-11","2.12~rc1-12","2.12~rc1-13","2.12~rc1-2","2.12~rc1-3","2.12~rc1-6","2.12~rc1-7","2.12~rc1-8","2.12~rc1-9","2.14~git20250718.0e36779-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-3981.json"}},{"package":{"name":"grub2","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/grub2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.06-8"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-3981.json"}},{"package":{"name":"grub2","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/grub2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.06-8"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-3981.json"}},{"package":{"name":"grub2","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/grub2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.06-8"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-3981.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3981"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
