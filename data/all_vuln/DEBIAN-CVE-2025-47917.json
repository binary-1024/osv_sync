{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-47917","published":"2025-07-20T19:15:23Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:20:36.492830Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-47917"],"details":"Mbed TLS before 3.6.4 allows a use-after-free in certain situations of applications that are developed in accordance with the documentation. The function mbedtls_x509_string_to_names() takes a head argument that is documented as an output argument. The documentation does not suggest that the function will free that pointer; however, the function does call mbedtls_asn1_free_named_data_list() on that argument, which performs a deep free(). As a result, application code that uses this function (relying only on documented behavior) is likely to still hold pointers to the memory blocks that were freed, resulting in a high risk of use-after-free or double-free. In particular, the two sample programs x509/cert_write and x509/cert_req are affected (use-after-free if the san string contains more than one DN).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.16.9-0.1+deb11u3"}]}],"versions":["2.16.9-0.1","2.16.9-0.1+deb11u1","2.16.9-0.1+deb11u2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-47917.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.28.3-1","2.28.4-1","2.28.5-1","2.28.6-1","2.28.7-1","2.28.7-1.1","2.28.7-1.1~exp1","2.28.8-1","3.6.0-1","3.6.0-2","3.6.0-3","3.6.2-1","3.6.2-2","3.6.2-3","3.6.3-1","3.6.4-1","3.6.4-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-47917.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.4-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-47917.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.4-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-47917.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-47917"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
