A use-after-free was found in bq24190_remove in drivers/power/supply/bq24190_charger.c. It could allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a race condition.(CVE-2023-33288)\n\nA use after free flaw was found in hfsplus_put_super in fs/hfsplus/super.c in the Linux Kernel. This flaw could allow a local user to cause a denial of service problem.(CVE-2023-2985)\n\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.2.
