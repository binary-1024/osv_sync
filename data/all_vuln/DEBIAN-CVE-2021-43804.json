  "details": "PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In affected versions if the incoming RTCP BYE message contains a reason's length, this declared length is not checked against the actual received packet size, potentially resulting in an out-of-bound read access. This issue affects all users that use PJMEDIA and RTCP. A malicious actor can send a RTCP BYE message with an invalid reason length. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds.",
