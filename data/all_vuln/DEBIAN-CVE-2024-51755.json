In a sandbox, an attacker can access attributes of Array-like objects as they were not checked by the security policy. They are now checked via the property policy and the `__isset()` method is now called after the security check. This is a BC break. This issue has been patched in versions 3.11.2 and 3.14.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"php-twig","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/php-twig?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.14.3-1","2.14.3-1+deb11u1","2.14.3-1+deb11u2","2.14.3-1+deb11u3","2.14.3-1+deb11u4","3.0.0-1","3.0.0-2","3.0.0~beta1-1","3.0.1-1","3.0.3-1","3.0.4-1","3.0.5-1","3.1.1-1","3.10.1-1","3.10.3-1","3.11.0-1","3.13.0-1","3.14.0-1","3.14.0-2","3.14.0-3","3.14.0-4","3.14.2-1","3.14.2-2","3.14.2-3","3.15.0-1","3.15.0-2","3.17.1-1","3.17.1-2","3.18.0-1","3.18.0-2","3.18.0-4","3.18.0-5","3.18.0-6","3.18.0-7","3.19.0-1","3.19.0-1~bootstrap","3.2.1-1","3.20.0-1","3.20.0-1~bootstrap","3.20.0-2","3.21.1-1","3.21.1-2","3.21.1-3","3.3.0-1","3.3.2-1","3.3.3-1","3.3.3-2","3.3.3-2~stage1","3.3.3-3","3.3.4-1","3.3.6-1","3.3.7-1","3.3.8-1","3.3.8-2","3.3.9-1","3.4.1-1","3.4.2-1","3.4.3-1","3.4.3-2","3.5.0-1","3.5.1-1","3.5.1-1~bpo11+1","3.6.0-1","3.6.1-1","3.7.0-1","3.7.1-1","3.7.1-2","3.7.1-3","3.8.0-1","3.8.0-2","3.8.0-3","3.8.0-4","3.9.3-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-51755.json"}},{"package":{"name":"php-twig","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/php-twig?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.10.1-1","3.10.3-1","3.11.0-1","3.13.0-1","3.14.0-1","3.14.0-2","3.14.0-3","3.14.0-4","3.14.2-1","3.14.2-2","3.14.2-3","3.15.0-1","3.15.0-2","3.17.1-1","3.17.1-2","3.18.0-1","3.18.0-2","3.18.0-4","3.18.0-5","3.18.0-6","3.18.0-7","3.19.0-1","3.19.0-1~bootstrap","3.20.0-1","3.20.0-1~bootstrap","3.20.0-2","3.21.1-1","3.21.1-2","3.21.1-3","3.5.1-1","3.5.1-1+deb12u1","3.6.0-1","3.6.1-1","3.7.0-1","3.7.1-1","3.7.1-2","3.7.1-3","3.8.0-1","3.8.0-2","3.8.0-3","3.8.0-4","3.9.3-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-51755.json"}},{"package":{"name":"php-twig","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/php-twig?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.14.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-51755.json"}},{"package":{"name":"php-twig","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/php-twig?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.14.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-51755.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-51755"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
