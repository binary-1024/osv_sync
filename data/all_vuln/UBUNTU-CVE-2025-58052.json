Starting in version 0.9.6 and prior to version 1.2.0, attackers with group manager role can bypass intended restrictions allowing unauthorized access and changes despite role-based controls. Since it requires privileged access initially, exploitation is restricted to malicious insiders or compromised group managers accounts. Version 1.2.0 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"galette","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/galette@0.8+dfsg-1ubuntu1?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.8+dfsg-1","0.8+dfsg-1ubuntu1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"galette","binary_version":"0.8+dfsg-1ubuntu1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-58052.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-58052"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58052"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/galette/galette/security/advisories/GHSA-gp9g-gf56-fcxx"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
