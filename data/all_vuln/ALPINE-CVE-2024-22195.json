{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2024-22195","published":"2024-01-11T03:15:11.200Z","modified":"2025-11-19T06:15:52.514567Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-22195"],"details":"Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Special placeholders in the template allow writing code similar to Python syntax. It is possible to inject arbitrary HTML attributes into the rendered HTML template, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The Jinja `xmlattr` filter can be abused to inject arbitrary HTML attribute keys and values, bypassing the auto escaping mechanism and potentially leading to XSS. It may also be possible to bypass attribute validation checks if they are blacklist-based.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"py3-jinja2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-jinja2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.10-r0","2.10-r1","2.10-r2","2.10-r3","2.10.1-r0","2.10.3-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.11.1-r0","2.11.2-r0","2.11.3-r0","2.11.3-r1","2.5.5-r0","2.5.5-r1","2.5.5-r2","2.5.5-r3","2.6-r0","2.7-r0","2.7-r1","2.7.1-r0","2.7.2-r0","2.7.3-r0","2.8-r0","2.8-r1","2.9.4-r0","2.9.4-r1","2.9.6-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.1-r0","3.0.1-r1","3.0.3-r0","3.0.3-r1","3.1.1-r0","3.1.2-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-22195.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-jinja2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-jinja2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.10-r0","2.10-r1","2.10-r2","2.10-r3","2.10.1-r0","2.10.3-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.11.1-r0","2.11.2-r0","2.11.3-r0","2.11.3-r1","2.5.5-r0","2.5.5-r1","2.5.5-r2","2.5.5-r3","2.6-r0","2.7-r0","2.7-r1","2.7.1-r0","2.7.2-r0","2.7.3-r0","2.8-r0","2.8-r1","2.9.4-r0","2.9.4-r1","2.9.6-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.1-r0","3.0.1-r1","3.0.3-r0","3.0.3-r1","3.1.1-r0","3.1.2-r0","3.1.2-r1","3.1.2-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-22195.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-jinja2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-jinja2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.10-r0","2.10-r1","2.10-r2","2.10-r3","2.10.1-r0","2.10.3-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.11.1-r0","2.11.2-r0","2.11.3-r0","2.11.3-r1","2.5.5-r0","2.5.5-r1","2.5.5-r2","2.5.5-r3","2.6-r0","2.7-r0","2.7-r1","2.7.1-r0","2.7.2-r0","2.7.3-r0","2.8-r0","2.8-r1","2.9.4-r0","2.9.4-r1","2.9.6-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.1-r0","3.0.1-r1","3.0.3-r0","3.0.3-r1","3.1.1-r0","3.1.2-r0","3.1.2-r1","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-22195.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-jinja2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-jinja2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.10-r0","2.10-r1","2.10-r2","2.10-r3","2.10.1-r0","2.10.3-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.11.1-r0","2.11.2-r0","2.11.3-r0","2.11.3-r1","2.5.5-r0","2.5.5-r1","2.5.5-r2","2.5.5-r3","2.6-r0","2.7-r0","2.7-r1","2.7.1-r0","2.7.2-r0","2.7.3-r0","2.8-r0","2.8-r1","2.9.4-r0","2.9.4-r1","2.9.6-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.1-r0","3.0.1-r1","3.0.3-r0","3.0.3-r1","3.1.1-r0","3.1.2-r0","3.1.2-r1","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-22195.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-jinja2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-jinja2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.10-r0","2.10-r1","2.10-r2","2.10-r3","2.10.1-r0","2.10.3-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.11.1-r0","2.11.2-r0","2.11.3-r0","2.11.3-r1","2.5.5-r0","2.5.5-r1","2.5.5-r2","2.5.5-r3","2.6-r0","2.7-r0","2.7-r1","2.7.1-r0","2.7.2-r0","2.7.3-r0","2.8-r0","2.8-r1","2.9.4-r0","2.9.4-r1","2.9.6-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.1-r0","3.0.1-r1","3.0.3-r0","3.0.3-r1","3.1.1-r0","3.1.2-r0","3.1.2-r1","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-22195.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-jinja2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-jinja2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.10-r0","2.10-r1","2.10-r2","2.10-r3","2.10.1-r0","2.10.3-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.11.1-r0","2.11.2-r0","2.11.3-r0","2.11.3-r1","2.5.5-r0","2.5.5-r1","2.5.5-r2","2.5.5-r3","2.6-r0","2.7-r0","2.7-r1","2.7.1-r0","2.7.2-r0","2.7.3-r0","2.8-r0","2.8-r1","2.9.4-r0","2.9.4-r1","2.9.6-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.1-r0","3.0.1-r1","3.0.3-r0","3.0.3-r1","3.1.1-r0","3.1.2-r0","3.1.2-r1","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-22195.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2024-22195"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
