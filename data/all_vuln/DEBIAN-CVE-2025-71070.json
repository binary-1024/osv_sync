{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-71070","published":"2026-01-13T16:16:06.413Z","modified":"2026-01-14T11:11:05.160866Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-71070"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ublk: clean up user copy references on ublk server exit  If a ublk server process releases a ublk char device file, any requests dispatched to the ublk server but not yet completed will retain a ref value of UBLK_REFCOUNT_INIT. Before commit e63d2228ef83 (\"ublk: simplify aborting ublk request\"), __ublk_fail_req() would decrement the reference count before completing the failed request. However, that commit optimized __ublk_fail_req() to call __ublk_complete_rq() directly without decrementing the request reference count. The leaked reference count incorrectly allows user copy and zero copy operations on the completed ublk request. It also triggers the WARN_ON_ONCE(refcount_read(&io->ref)) warnings in ublk_queue_reinit() and ublk_deinit_queue(). Commit c5c5eb24ed61 (\"ublk: avoid ublk_io_release() called after ublk char dev is closed\") already fixed the issue for ublk devices using UBLK_F_SUPPORT_ZERO_COPY or UBLK_F_AUTO_BUF_REG. However, the reference count leak also affects UBLK_F_USER_COPY, the other reference-counted data copy mode. Fix the condition in ublk_check_and_reset_active_ref() to include all reference-counted data copy modes. This ensures that any ublk requests still owned by the ublk server when it exits have their reference counts reset to 0.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.57-1","6.12.57-1~bpo12+1","6.12.63-1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.10-1","6.16.11-1","6.16.12-1","6.16.12-1~bpo13+1","6.16.12-2","6.16.3-1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16.5-1","6.16.6-1","6.16.7-1","6.16.8-1","6.16.9-1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1","6.17.10-1","6.17.11-1","6.17.12-1","6.17.13-1","6.17.13-1~bpo13+1","6.17.2-1~exp1","6.17.5-1~exp1","6.17.6-1","6.17.7-1","6.17.7-2","6.17.8-1","6.17.8-1~bpo13+1","6.17.9-1","6.18.1-1~exp1","6.18.2-1~exp1","6.18.3-1","6.18~rc4-1~exp1","6.18~rc4-1~exp2","6.18~rc5-1~exp1","6.18~rc6-1~exp1","6.18~rc7-1~exp1","6.19~rc4-1~exp1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-71070.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-71070"}]}
