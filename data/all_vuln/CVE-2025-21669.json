  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvsock/virtio: discard packets if the transport changes\n\nIf the socket has been de-assigned or assigned to another transport,\nwe must discard any packets received because they are not expected\nand would cause issues when we access vsk->transport.\n\nA possible scenario is described by Hyunwoo Kim in the attached link,\nwhere after a first connect() interrupted by a signal, and a second\nconnect() failed, we can find `vsk->transport` at NULL, leading to a\nNULL pointer dereference.",
