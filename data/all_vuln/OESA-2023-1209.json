This flaw allows a local user to crash the system. Only if patch 390031c94211 (&quot;coredump: Use the vma snapshot in fill_files_note&quot;) not applied yet, then kernel could be affected.(CVE-2023-1249)\r\n\r\nA null pointer dereference issue was found in the unix protocol in net/unix/diag.c in Linux before 6.0. In unix_diag_get_exact, the newly allocated skb does not have sk, leading to null pointer. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially cause a denial of service.\r\n\r\nReference:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/netdev/CAO4mrfdvyjFpokhNsiwZiP-wpdSD0AStcJwfKcKQdAALQ9_2Qw@mail.gmail.com/\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/netdev/e04315e7c90d9a75613f3993c2baf2d344eef7eb.camel@redhat.com/\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20221127012412.37969-3-kuniyu@amazon.com/T/(CVE-2023-28327)\r\n\r\n\nKernel: A denial of service issue in  az6027 driver in\ndrivers/media/usb/dev-usb/az6027.c(CVE-2023-28328)\r\n\r\nA slab-out-of-bound read problem was found in brcmf_get_assoc_ies in drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/cfg80211.c in the Linux Kernel. This issue could occur when assoc_info-&gt;req_len data is bigger than the size of the buffer, defined as WL_EXTRA_BUF_MAX, leading to a denial of service.(CVE-2023-1380)\r\n\r\ndo_tls_getsockopt in net/tls/tls_main.c in the Linux kernel through 6.2.6 lacks a lock_sock call, leading to a race condition (with a resultant use-after-free or NULL pointer dereference).(CVE-2023-28466)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel before 6.1.3, fs/ntfs3/inode.c does not validate the attribute name offset. An unhandled page fault may occur.(CVE-2022-48424)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel before 6.1.3, fs/ntfs3/record.c does not validate resident attribute names. An out-of-bounds write may occur.(CVE-2022-48423)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel through 6.2.7, fs/ntfs3/inode.c has an invalid kfree because it does not validate MFT flags before replaying logs.(CVE-2022-48425)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in KVM. When calling the KVM_GET_DEBUGREGS ioctl, on 32-bit systems, there might be some uninitialized portions of the kvm_debugregs structure that could be copied to userspace, causing an information leak.(CVE-2023-1513)\r\n\r\nUse After Free vulnerability in Linux kernel traffic control index filter (tcindex) allows Privilege Escalation. The imperfect hash area can be updated while packets are traversing, which will cause a use-after-free when &apos;tcf_exts_exec()&apos; is called with the destroyed tcf_ext.
