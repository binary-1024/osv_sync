  "details": "Use ImageMagick to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images. It can read and write images in a variety of formats (over 200) including PNG, JPEG, GIF, HEIC, TIFF, DPX, EXR, WebP, Postscript, PDF, and SVG. Use ImageMagick to resize, flip, mirror, rotate, distort, shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various special effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and B\u00e9zier curves.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/quantum-private.h. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger a heap buffer overflow. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially lead to an impact to data integrity as well. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.(CVE-2020-27752)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in ImageMagick in versions before 7.0.11. A potential cipher leak when the calculate signatures in TransformSignature is possible. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.(CVE-2021-20313)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in ImageMagick in versions before 7.0.11, where a division by zero in sRGBTransformImage() in the MagickCore/colorspace.c may trigger undefined behavior via a crafted image file that is submitted by an attacker processed by an application using ImageMagick. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-20311)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in ImageMagick in versions 7.0.11, where an integer overflow in WriteTHUMBNAILImage of coders/thumbnail.c may trigger undefined behavior via a crafted image file that is submitted by an attacker and processed by an application using ImageMagick. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-20312)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in ImageMagick in versions before 7.0.11 and before 6.9.12, where a division by zero in WaveImage() of MagickCore/visual-effects.c may trigger undefined behavior via a crafted image file submitted to an application using ImageMagick. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-20309)\r\n\r\nIn ImageMagick versions before 7.0.9-0, there are outside the range of representable values of type &apos;float&apos; at MagickCore/quantize.c.(CVE-2020-27769)",
