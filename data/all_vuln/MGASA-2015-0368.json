  "details": "Updated qemu packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nQemu emulator built with the RTL8139 emulation support is vulnerable to an\ninformation leakage flaw. It could occur while processing network packets\nunder RTL8139 controller's C+ mode of operation. A guest user could use this\nflaw to read uninitialised Qemu heap memory up to 65K bytes (CVE-2015-5165).\n\nQemu emulator built with the VNC display driver is vulnerable to an infinite\nloop issue. It could occur while processing a CLIENT_CUT_TEXT message with\nspecially crafted payload message. A privileged guest user could use this flaw\nto crash the Qemu process on the host, resulting in DoS (CVE-2015-5239).\n\nQemu emulator built with the e1000 NIC emulation support is vulnerable to an\ninfinite loop issue. It could occur while processing transmit descriptor data\nwhen sending a network packet. A privileged user inside guest could use this\nflaw to crash the Qemu instance resulting in DoS (CVE-2015-6815).\n\nQemu emulator built with the IDE disk and CD/DVD-ROM emulation support is\nvulnerable to a divide by zero issue. It could occur while executing an IDE\ncommand WIN_READ_NATIVE_MAX to determine the maximum size of a drive. A\nprivileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu instance\nresulting in DoS (CVE-2015-6855).\n",
