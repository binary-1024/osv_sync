Note that sock_release() is synchronous but fput() usually delays the final close and clean-up.  The delay is not consequential in the other cases that were changed but handshake_req_destroy_test1 is testing that handshake_req_cancel() followed by closing the file actually does call the ->hp_destroy method. Thus the PTR_EQ test at the end has to be sure that the final close is complete before it checks the pointer.  We cannot use a completion here because if ->hp_destroy is never called (ie, there is an API bug) then the test will hang.
