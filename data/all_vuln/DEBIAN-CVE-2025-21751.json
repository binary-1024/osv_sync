  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5: HWS, change error flow on matcher disconnect  Currently, when firmware failure occurs during matcher disconnect flow, the error flow of the function reconnects the matcher back and returns an error, which continues running the calling function and eventually frees the matcher that is being disconnected. This leads to a case where we have a freed matcher on the matchers list, which in turn leads to use-after-free and eventual crash.  This patch fixes that by not trying to reconnect the matcher back when some FW command fails during disconnect.  Note that we're dealing here with FW error. We can't overcome this problem. This might lead to bad steering state (e.g. wrong connection between matchers), and will also lead to resource leakage, as it is the case with any other error handling during resource destruction.  However, the goal here is to allow the driver to continue and not crash the machine with use-after-free error.",
