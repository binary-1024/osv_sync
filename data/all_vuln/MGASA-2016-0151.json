  "details": "Updated samba packages fix security vulnerability:\n\nJouni Knuutinen discovered that Samba contained multiple flaws in the\nDCE/RPC implementation. A remote attacker could use this issue to perform\na denial of service, downgrade secure connections by performing a man in\nthe middle attack, or possibly execute arbitrary code (CVE-2015-5370).\n\nStefan Metzmacher discovered that Samba contained multiple flaws in the\nNTLMSSP authentication implementation. A remote attacker could use this\nissue to downgrade connections to plain text by performing a man in the\nmiddle attack (CVE-2016-2110).\n\nAlberto Solino discovered that a Samba domain controller would establish a\nsecure connection to a server with a spoofed computer name. A remote\nattacker could use this issue to obtain sensitive information\n(CVE-2016-2111).\n\nStefan Metzmacher discovered that the Samba LDAP implementation did not\nenforce integrity protection. A remote attacker could use this issue to\nhijack LDAP connections by performing a man in the middle attack\n(CVE-2016-2112).\n\nStefan Metzmacher discovered that Samba did not enable integrity protection\nfor IPC traffic. A remote attacker could use this issue to perform a man in\nthe middle attack (CVE-2016-2115).\n\nStefan Metzmacher discovered that Samba incorrectly handled the MS-SAMR and\nMS-LSAD protocols. A remote attacker could use this flaw with a man in the\nmiddle attack to impersonate users and obtain sensitive information from\nthe Security Account Manager database. This flaw is known as Badlock\n(CVE-2016-2118).\n",
