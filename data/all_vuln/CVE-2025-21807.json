  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: fix queue freeze vs limits lock order in sysfs store methods\n\nqueue_attr_store() always freezes a device queue before calling the\nattribute store operation. For attributes that control queue limits, the\nstore operation will also lock the queue limits with a call to\nqueue_limits_start_update(). However, some drivers (e.g. SCSI sd) may\nneed to issue commands to a device to obtain limit values from the\nhardware with the queue limits locked. This creates a potential ABBA\ndeadlock situation if a user attempts to modify a limit (thus freezing\nthe device queue) while the device driver starts a revalidation of the\ndevice queue limits.\n\nAvoid such deadlock by not freezing the queue before calling the\n->store_limit() method in struct queue_sysfs_entry and instead use the\nqueue_limits_commit_update_frozen helper to freeze the queue after taking\nthe limits lock.\n\nThis also removes taking the sysfs lock for the store_limit method as\nit doesn't protect anything here, but creates even more nesting.\nHopefully it will go away from the actual sysfs methods entirely soon.\n\n(commit log adapted from a similar patch from  Damien Le Moal)",
