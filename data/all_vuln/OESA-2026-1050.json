It handles all requests in a single, non-blocking, I/O-driven process and keeps meta data and implements negative caching of failed requests.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA flaw was found in Squid. The limits applied for validation of HTTP response headers are applied before caching. However, Squid may grow a cached HTTP response header beyond the configured maximum size, causing a stall or crash of the worker process when a large header is retrieved from the disk cache, resulting in a denial of service.(CVE-2023-5824)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"squid","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/squid&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.9-29.oe2203sp3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["squid-4.9-29.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","squid-debuginfo-4.9-29.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","squid-debugsource-4.9-29.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["squid-4.9-29.oe2203sp3.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["squid-4.9-29.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","squid-debuginfo-4.9-29.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","squid-debugsource-4.9-29.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2026-1050.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2026-1050"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-5824"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
