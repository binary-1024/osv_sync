  "details": "It was reported that rpc.gssd in nfs-utils is vulnerable to DNS spoofing due\nto it depending on PTR resolution for GSSAPI authentication. Because of this,\nif a user where able to poison DNS to a victim's computer, they would be able\nto trick rpc.gssd into talking to another server (perhaps with less security)\nthan the intended server (with stricter security). If the victim has write\naccess to the second (less secure) server, and the attacker has read access\n(when they normally might not on the secure server), the victim could write\nfiles to that server, which the attacker could obtain (when normally they\nwould not be able to). To the victim this is transparent because the victim's\ncomputer asks the KDC for a ticket to the second server due to reverse DNS\nresolution; in this case Krb5 authentication does not fail because the victim\nis talking to the \"correct\" server (CVE-2013-1923).\n",
