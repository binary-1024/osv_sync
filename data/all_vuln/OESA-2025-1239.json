  "details": "JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter offering all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook, terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a flexible and powerful user interface.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nJupyterLab is an extensible environment for interactive and reproducible computing, based on the Jupyter Notebook and Architecture. This vulnerability depends on user interaction by opening a malicious Markdown file using JupyterLab preview feature. A malicious user can access any data that the attacked user has access to as well as perform arbitrary requests acting as the attacked user. JupyterLab version 4.0.11 has been patched. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable the table of contents extension.(CVE-2024-22420)",
