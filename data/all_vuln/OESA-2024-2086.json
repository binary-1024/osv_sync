The issue only affects NGINX if it is built with the ngx_http_mp4_module and the mp4 directive is used in the configuration file. Additionally, the attack is possible only if an attacker can trigger the processing of a specially crafted mp4 file with the ngx_http_mp4_module.  Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.(CVE-2024-7347)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nginx","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/nginx&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.21.5-5.oe2003sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["nginx-1.21.5-5.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","nginx-debuginfo-1.21.5-5.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","nginx-debugsource-1.21.5-5.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","nginx-mod-devel-1.21.5-5.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","nginx-mod-http-image-filter-1.21.5-5.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","nginx-mod-http-perl-1.21.5-5.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","nginx-mod-http-xslt-filter-1.21.5-5.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","nginx-mod-mail-1.21.5-5.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","nginx-mod-stream-1.21.5-5.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["nginx-all-modules-1.21.5-5.oe2003sp4.noarch.rpm","nginx-filesystem-1.21.5-5.oe2003sp4.noarch.rpm"],"src":["nginx-1.21.5-5.oe2003sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["nginx-1.21.5-5.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","nginx-debuginfo-1.21.5-5.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","nginx-debugsource-1.21.5-5.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","nginx-mod-devel-1.21.5-5.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","nginx-mod-http-image-filter-1.21.5-5.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","nginx-mod-http-perl-1.21.5-5.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","nginx-mod-http-xslt-filter-1.21.5-5.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","nginx-mod-mail-1.21.5-5.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","nginx-mod-stream-1.21.5-5.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-2086.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2024-2086"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7347"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
