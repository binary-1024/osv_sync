  "details": "Updated firefox and libwebp packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nUnexpected data returned from the Safe Browsing API could have led to memory\ncorruption and a potentially exploitable crash (CVE-2023-1945).\n\nA website could have obscured the fullscreen notification by using a\ncombination of window.open, fullscreen requests, window.name assignments, and\nsetInterval calls. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing\nattacks (CVE-2023-29533).\n\nFollowing a Garbage Collector compaction, weak maps may have been accessed\nbefore they were correctly traced. This resulted in memory corruption and a\npotentially exploitable crash (CVE-2023-29535).\n\nAn attacker could, via JavaScript code, cause the memory manager to\nincorrectly free a pointer that addresses attacker-controlled memory,\nresulting in an assertion, memory corruption, or a potentially exploitable\ncrash (CVE-2023-29536).\n\nWhen handling the filename directive in the Content-Disposition header, the\nfilename would be truncated if the filename contained a NULL character. This\ncould have led to reflected file download attacks potentially tricking users\nto install malware (CVE-2023-29539).\n\nFirefox did not properly handle downloads of files ending in .desktop, which\ncan be interpreted to run attacker-controlled commands (CVE-2023-29541).\n\nMozilla developers Andrew Osmond, Sebastian Hengst, Andrew McCreight, and the\nMozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox ESR 102.9.\nSome of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that\nwith enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary\ncode (CVE-2023-29550).\n\nA double-free in libwebp could have led to memory corruption and a\npotentially exploitable crash (MFSA-TMP-2023-0001).\n",
