NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2018-19296, but arose because 6.1.8 fixed a functionality problem in which UNC pathnames were always considered unreadable by PHPMailer, even in safe contexts. As an unintended side effect, this fix eliminated the code that blocked addAttachment exploitation.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libphp-phpmailer","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:22.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libphp-phpmailer@6.2.0-2?arch=source&distro=jammy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.2.0-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"libphp-phpmailer","binary_version":"6.2.0-2"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2020/UBUNTU-CVE-2020-36326.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-36326"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/commit/e2e07a355ee8ff36aba21d0242c5950c56e4c6f9"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-36326"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
