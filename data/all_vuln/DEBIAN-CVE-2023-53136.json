Issue is that queue_oob() calls maybe_add_creds() which potentially holds a reference on a pid.  But skb->destructor is not set (either directly or by calling unix_scm_to_skb())  This means that subsequent kfree_skb() or consume_skb() would leak this reference.  In this fix, I chose to fully support scm even for the OOB message.
