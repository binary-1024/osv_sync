The `cfGetPrinterAttributes5` function in `libcupsfilters` does not sanitize IPP attributes returned from an IPP server. When these IPP attributes are used, for instance, to generate a PPD file, this can lead to attacker controlled data to be provided to the rest of the CUPS system.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"cups-filters","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:20.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/cups-filters@1.27.4-1ubuntu0.4?arch=source&distro=focal"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.27.4-1ubuntu0.4"}]}],"versions":["1.25.11-0ubuntu1","1.25.11-1","1.25.12-1","1.25.13-1","1.26.0-1","1.26.1-1","1.26.2-1","1.27.0-1","1.27.0-2","1.27.1-1","1.27.1-2","1.27.1-3","1.27.2-1","1.27.3-1","1.27.4-1","1.27.4-1ubuntu0.2","1.27.4-1ubuntu0.3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"cups-browsed","binary_version":"1.27.4-1ubuntu0.4"},{"binary_name":"cups-filters","binary_version":"1.27.4-1ubuntu0.4"},{"binary_name":"cups-filters-core-drivers","binary_version":"1.27.4-1ubuntu0.4"},{"binary_name":"libcupsfilters-dev","binary_version":"1.27.4-1ubuntu0.4"},{"binary_name":"libcupsfilters1","binary_version":"1.27.4-1ubuntu0.4"},{"binary_name":"libfontembed-dev","binary_version":"1.27.4-1ubuntu0.4"},{"binary_name":"libfontembed1","binary_version":"1.27.4-1ubuntu0.4"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2024/UBUNTU-CVE-2024-47076.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cups-filters","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:22.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/cups-filters@1.28.15-0ubuntu1.4?arch=source&distro=jammy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.28.15-0ubuntu1.4"}]}],"versions":["1.28.10-2","1.28.11-1","1.28.11-2","1.28.12-1","1.28.13-0ubuntu1","1.28.14-1","1.28.15-0ubuntu1","1.28.15-0ubuntu1.2","1.28.15-0ubuntu1.3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"cups-browsed","binary_version":"1.28.15-0ubuntu1.4"},{"binary_name":"cups-filters","binary_version":"1.28.15-0ubuntu1.4"},{"binary_name":"cups-filters-core-drivers","binary_version":"1.28.15-0ubuntu1.4"},{"binary_name":"libcupsfilters-dev","binary_version":"1.28.15-0ubuntu1.4"},{"binary_name":"libcupsfilters1","binary_version":"1.28.15-0ubuntu1.4"},{"binary_name":"libfontembed-dev","binary_version":"1.28.15-0ubuntu1.4"},{"binary_name":"libfontembed1","binary_version":"1.28.15-0ubuntu1.4"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2024/UBUNTU-CVE-2024-47076.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libcupsfilters","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libcupsfilters@2.0.0-0ubuntu7.1?arch=source&distro=noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.0.0-0ubuntu7.1"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-0ubuntu1","2.0.0-0ubuntu6","2.0.0-0ubuntu7"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"libcupsfilters-dev","binary_version":"2.0.0-0ubuntu7.1"},{"binary_name":"libcupsfilters-tests","binary_version":"2.0.0-0ubuntu7.1"},{"binary_name":"libcupsfilters2-common","binary_version":"2.0.0-0ubuntu7.1"},{"binary_name":"libcupsfilters2t64","binary_version":"2.0.0-0ubuntu7.1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2024/UBUNTU-CVE-2024-47076.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-47076"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47076"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libcupsfilters/security/advisories/GHSA-w63j-6g73-wmg5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7043-1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7044-1"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/blog/cups-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-fix-available"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7043-4"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N"},{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
