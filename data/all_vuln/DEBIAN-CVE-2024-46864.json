For the hyperv case, since a new cpuhp state was introduced it would return 0. However, in hv_machine_shutdown(), the cpuhp_remove_state() call is conditioned upon \"hyperv_init_cpuhp > 0\". This will never be true and so hv_cpu_die() won't be called on all CPUs. This means the VP assist page won't be reset. When the kexec kernel tries to setup the VP assist page again, the hypervisor corrupts the memory region of the old VP assist page causing a panic in case the kexec kernel is using that memory elsewhere. This was originally fixed in commit dfe94d4086e4 (\"x86/hyperv: Fix kexec panic/hang issues\").  Get rid of hyperv_init_cpuhp entirely since we are no longer using a dynamic cpuhp state and use CPUHP_AP_HYPERV_ONLINE directly with cpuhp_remove_state().","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.10.11-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-46864.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.10.11-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-46864.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-46864"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
