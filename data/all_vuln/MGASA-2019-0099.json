  "details": "A flaw was found in the way spice-client processed certain messages sent\nfrom the server. An attacker, having control of malicious spice-server,\ncould use this flaw to crash the client or execute arbitrary code with\npermissions of the user running the client. spice-gtk versions through\n0.34 are believed to be vulnerable. (CVE-2017-12194)\n\nA vulnerability was discovered in SPICE before version 0.14.1 where the\ngenerated code used for demarshalling messages lacked sufficient bounds\nchecks. A malicious client or server, after authentication, could send\nspecially crafted messages to its peer which would result in a crash or,\npotentially, other impacts. (CVE-2018-10873)\n\nMultiple integer overflow and buffer overflow issues were discovered in\nspice-client's handling of LZ compressed frames. A malicious server could\ncause the client to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2018-10893)\n",
