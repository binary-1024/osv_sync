{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53706","published":"2025-10-22T14:15:45Z","modified":"2025-10-23T09:03:37.872058Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-53706"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/vmemmap/devdax: fix kernel crash when probing devdax devices  commit 4917f55b4ef9 (\"mm/sparse-vmemmap: improve memory savings for compound devmaps\") added support for using optimized vmmemap for devdax devices.  But how vmemmap mappings are created are architecture specific.  For example, powerpc with hash translation doesn't have vmemmap mappings in init_mm page table instead they are bolted table entries in the hardware page table  vmemmap_populate_compound_pages() used by vmemmap optimization code is not aware of these architecture-specific mapping.  Hence allow architecture to opt for this feature.  I selected architectures supporting HUGETLB_PAGE_OPTIMIZE_VMEMMAP option as also supporting this feature.  This patch fixes the below crash on ppc64.
