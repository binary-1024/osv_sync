  "details": "A flaw was found in libsoup. The implementation of HTTP range requests is vulnerable to a resource consumption attack. This flaw allows a malicious client to request the same range many times in a single HTTP request, causing the server to use large amounts of memory. This does not allow for a full denial of service.",
