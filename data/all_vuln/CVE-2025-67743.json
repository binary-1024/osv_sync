{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-67743","published":"2025-12-23T00:01:19.309Z","modified":"2026-01-28T19:53:58.491734Z","aliases":["GHSA-9c54-gxh7-ppjc"],"summary":"Local Deep Research is Vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Download Service","details":"Local Deep Research is an AI-powered research assistant for deep, iterative research. In versions from 1.3.0 to before 1.3.9, the download service (download_service.py) makes HTTP requests using raw requests.get() without utilizing the application's SSRF protection (safe_requests.py). This can allow attackers to access internal services and attempt to reach cloud provider metadata endpoints (AWS/GCP/Azure), as well as perform internal network reconnaissance, by submitting malicious URLs through the API, depending on the deployment and surrounding controls. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.9.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/learningcircuit/local-deep-research","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b79089ff30c5d9ae77e6b903c408e1c26ad5c055"}]}],"versions":["0.6.7","v0.4.4","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.5.5","v0.5.6","v0.5.7","v0.5.9","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.4","v0.6.5","v0.6.6","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.10","v1.1.11","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.1.7","v1.1.8","v1.1.9","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.10","v1.2.11","v1.2.12","v1.2.13","v1.2.14","v1.2.15","v1.2.16","v1.2.17","v1.2.18","v1.2.19","v1.2.2","v1.2.20","v1.2.21","v1.2.22","v1.2.23","v1.2.24","v1.2.25","v1.2.26","v1.2.27","v1.2.28","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.2.9","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.3.7","v1.3.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-67743.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67743.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/LearningCircuit/local-deep-research/commit/b79089ff30c5d9ae77e6b903c408e1c26ad5c055"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/LearningCircuit/local-deep-research/security/advisories/GHSA-9c54-gxh7-ppjc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-67743"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-918"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67743.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
