An off-by-one error when processing malformed TLS-CBC ciphertext could cause the receiving side to include in the HMAC computation exactly 64K bytes of data following the record buffer, aka an over-read. The MAC comparison will subsequently fail and the connection will be closed. This could be used for denial of service. No information leak occurs.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/botan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.6.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.5.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-9860.json"}},{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/botan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.6.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.5.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-9860.json"}},{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/botan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.6.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.5.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-9860.json"}},{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/botan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.6.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.5.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-9860.json"}},{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/botan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.6.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.5.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-9860.json"}},{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/botan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.6.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.5.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-9860.json"}},{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/botan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.6.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.5.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-9860.json"}},{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/botan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.6.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.5.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-9860.json"}},{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/botan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.6.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.5.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-9860.json"}},{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/botan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.6.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.5.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-9860.json"}},{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/botan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.6.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.5.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-9860.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2018-9860"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
