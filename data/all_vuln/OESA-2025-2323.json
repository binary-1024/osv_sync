The user can run the packaged app without installing a Python interpreter or any modules.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nDue to a special entry being appended to sys.path during the bootstrap process of a PyInstaller-frozen application, and due to the bootstrap script attempting to load an optional module for bytecode decryption while this entry is still present in sys.path, an application built with PyInstaller &lt; 6.0.0 may be tricked by an unprivileged attacker into executing arbitrary python code. The attacker can create a directory or zip archive next to the executable with a specific name format, resulting in local privilege escalation when the executable runs with elevated privileges.(CVE-2025-59042)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-pyinstaller","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python-pyinstaller&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.13.0-3.oe2403sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python-pyinstaller-debuginfo-5.13.0-3.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","python-pyinstaller-debugsource-5.13.0-3.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","python-pyinstaller-help-5.13.0-3.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","python3-pyinstaller-5.13.0-3.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["python-pyinstaller-5.13.0-3.oe2403sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python-pyinstaller-debuginfo-5.13.0-3.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","python-pyinstaller-debugsource-5.13.0-3.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","python-pyinstaller-help-5.13.0-3.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","python3-pyinstaller-5.13.0-3.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2323.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2323"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59042"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
