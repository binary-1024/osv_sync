In versions 2.4.2 and prior, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability would allow a remote attacker to launch a denial of service (DoS) attack. A buffer overflow vulnerability in the function `format_log_line` could allow remote attackers to cause a DoS on the affected system. Exploitation of the vulnerability can be triggered when the configuration file `cupsd.conf` sets the value of `loglevel `to `DEBUG`. No known patches or workarounds exist at time of publication.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-32324.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups/security/advisories/GHSA-cxc6-w2g7-69p7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00001.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-122","CWE-787"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
