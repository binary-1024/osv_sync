  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: light: Add check for array bounds in veml6075_read_int_time_ms  The array contains only 5 elements, but the index calculated by veml6075_read_int_time_index can range from 0 to 7, which could lead to out-of-bounds access. The check prevents this issue.  Coverity Issue CID 1574309: (#1 of 1): Out-of-bounds read (OVERRUN) overrun-local: Overrunning array veml6075_it_ms of 5 4-byte elements at element index 7 (byte offset 31) using index int_index (which evaluates to 7)  This is hardening against potentially broken hardware. Good to have but not necessary to backport.",
