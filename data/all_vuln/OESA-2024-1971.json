BIND includes a DNS server (named), which resolves host names to IP addresses; a resolver library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating properly.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols and provides an openly redistributable reference implementation of the major components of the Domain Name System. This package includes the components to operate a DNS server.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nResolver caches and authoritative zone databases that hold significant numbers of RRs for the same hostname (of any RTYPE) can suffer from degraded performance as content is being added or updated, and also when handling client queries for this name.\nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.11.0 through 9.11.37, 9.16.0 through 9.16.50, 9.18.0 through 9.18.27, 9.19.0 through 9.19.24, 9.11.4-S1 through 9.11.37-S1, 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.50-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.27-S1.(CVE-2024-1737)\r\n\r\nIf a server hosts a zone containing a &quot;KEY&quot; Resource Record, or a resolver DNSSEC-validates a &quot;KEY&quot; Resource Record from a DNSSEC-signed domain in cache, a client can exhaust resolver CPU resources by sending a stream of SIG(0) signed requests.\nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.0.0 through 9.11.37, 9.16.0 through 9.16.50, 9.18.0 through 9.18.27, 9.19.0 through 9.19.24, 9.9.3-S1 through 9.11.37-S1, 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.49-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.27-S1.(CVE-2024-1975)\r\n\r\nClient queries that trigger serving stale data and that also require lookups in local authoritative zone data may result in an assertion failure.\nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.13 through 9.16.50, 9.18.0 through 9.18.27, 9.19.0 through 9.19.24, 9.11.33-S1 through 9.11.37-S1, 9.16.13-S1 through 9.16.50-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.27-S1.(CVE-2024-4076)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"bind","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/bind&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["bind-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","bind-chroot-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","bind-debuginfo-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","bind-debugsource-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","bind-devel-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","bind-dnssec-utils-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","bind-libs-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-devel-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-libs-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-utils-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","bind-utils-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["bind-dnssec-doc-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.noarch.rpm","bind-license-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.noarch.rpm","python3-bind-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.noarch.rpm"],"src":["bind-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["bind-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","bind-chroot-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","bind-debuginfo-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","bind-debugsource-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","bind-devel-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","bind-dnssec-utils-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","bind-libs-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-devel-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-libs-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-utils-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","bind-utils-9.16.23-23.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-1971.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2024-1971"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1737"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1975"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-4076"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
