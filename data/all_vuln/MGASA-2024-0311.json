  "details": "An issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.78.5, and 2.79.x and\n2.80.x before 2.80.1. When a GDBus-based client subscribes to signals\nfrom a trusted system service such as NetworkManager on a shared\ncomputer, other users of the same computer can send spoofed D-Bus\nsignals that the GDBus-based client will wrongly interpret as having\nbeen sent by the trusted system service. This could lead to the\nGDBus-based client behaving incorrectly, with an application-dependent\nimpact. (CVE-2024-34397)\n",
