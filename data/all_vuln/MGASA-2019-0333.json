  "summary": "Updated kernel-linus packages fix security vulnerabilities",
  "details": "This kernel-linus update is based on the upstream 5.3.11 and fixes at least\nthe following security issues:\n\nInsufficient access control in a subsystem for Intel (R) processor graphics\nmay allow an authenticated user to potentially enable escalation of\nprivilege via local access (CVE-2019-0155).\n\nA Spectre SWAPGS gadget was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of\nsystem interrupts. An attacker with local access could use this information\nto reveal private data through a Spectre like side channel (CVE-2019-1125).\n\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel\u2019s Bluetooth implementation of UART.\nAn attacker with local access and write permissions to the Bluetooth\nhardware could use this flaw to issue a specially crafted ioctl function\ncall and cause the system to crash (CVE-2019-10207).\n\nTSX Asynchronous Abort condition on some CPUs utilizing speculative\nexecution may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable\ninformation disclosure via a side channel with local access\n(CVE-2019-11135).\n\nImproper invalidation for page table updates by a virtual guest operating\nsystem for multiple Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to\npotentially enable denial of service of the host system via local access\n(CVE-2018-12207). \n\nFor proper mitigations and fixes for theese issues, a microcode update is\nalso needed, either with a bios/uefi update from your hardware vendor or\nby installing the microcode-0.20191112-1.mga7.nonfree update (mga#25688).\n\nThere is heap-based buffer overflow in the marvell wifi chip driver that\nallows local users to cause a denial of service(system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code (CVE-2019-14814, CVE-2019-14815, CVE-2019-14816).\n\nAn out-of-bounds access issue was found in the way Linux kernel's KVM\nhypervisor implements the Coalesced MMIO write operation. It operates on\nan MMIO ring buffer 'struct kvm_coalesced_mmio' object, wherein write\nindices 'ring->first' and 'ring->last' value could be supplied by a host\nuser-space process. An unprivileged host user or process with access to\n'/dev/kvm' device could use this flaw to crash the host kernel, resulting\nin a denial of service or potentially escalating privileges on the system\n(CVE-2019-14821).\n\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Linux kernel's vhost\nfunctionality that translates virtqueue buffers to IOVs, logged the buffer\ndescriptors during migration. A privileged guest user able to pass\ndescriptors with invalid length to the host when migration is underway,\ncould use this flaw to increase their privileges on the host\n(CVE-2019-14835).\n\nIn the Linux kernel before 5.2.14, rds6_inc_info_copy in net/rds/recv.c\nallows attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory\nbecause tos and flags fields are not initialized (CVE-2019-16714)\n\nrtl_p2p_noa_ie in drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtlwifi/ps.c in the Linux\nkernel through 5.3.6 lacks a certain upper-bound check, leading to a\nbuffer overflow (CVE-2019-17666)\n\nFor other upstream fixes in this update, see the referenced changelogs.\n",
