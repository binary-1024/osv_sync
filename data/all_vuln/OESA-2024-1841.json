  "details": "Exiv2 is a Cross-platform C++ library and a command line utility to manage image metadata. It provides fast and easy read and write access to the Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata and the ICC Profile embedded within digital images in various formats.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nExiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.2. The vulnerability is in the parser for the ASF video format, which was a new feature in v0.28.0. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted video file. The bug is fixed in version v0.28.3.(CVE-2024-39695)",
