NOTE: it could be argued that this vulnerability is caused by a problem in PHP (CVE-2006-1549) and the proper fix should be in PHP; if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"phpmyadmin","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/phpmyadmin?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4:2.10.0.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2007-1325.json"}},{"package":{"name":"phpmyadmin","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/phpmyadmin?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4:2.10.0.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2007-1325.json"}},{"package":{"name":"phpmyadmin","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/phpmyadmin?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4:2.10.0.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2007-1325.json"}},{"package":{"name":"phpmyadmin","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/phpmyadmin?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4:2.10.0.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2007-1325.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1325"}]}
