Specially crafted MXIT data sent via the server could potentially result in an out-of-bounds read. A malicious user, server, or man-in-the-middle attacker can send an invalid size for a file transfer which will trigger an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. This could result in a denial of service or copy data from memory to the file, resulting in an information leak if the file is sent to another user.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"pidgin","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/pidgin?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.11.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2016-2372.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pidgin","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/pidgin?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.11.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2016-2372.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pidgin","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/pidgin?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.11.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2016-2372.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pidgin","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/pidgin?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.11.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2016-2372.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2372"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H"}]}
