  "details": "When a BigInt was right-shifted the backing store was not properly cleared,\nallowing uninitialized memory to be read (CVE-2020-16042).\n\nCertain blit values provided by the user were not properly constrained leading\nto a heap buffer overflow in WebGL on some video drivers (CVE-2020-26971).\n\nCertain input to the CSS Sanitizer confused it, resulting in incorrect\ncomponents being removed. This could have been used as a sanitizer bypass\n(CVE-2020-26973).\n\nWhen flex-basis was used on a table wrapper, a StyleGenericFlexBasis object\ncould have been incorrectly cast to the wrong type. This resulted in a heap\nuser-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash\n(CVE-2020-26974).\n\nUsing techniques that built on the slipstream research, a malicious webpage\ncould have exposed both an internal network's hosts as well as services running\non the user's local machine (CVE-2020-26978).\n\nWhen an extension with the proxy permission registered to receive <all_urls>,\nthe proxy.onRequest callback was not triggered for view-source URLs. While web\ncontent cannot navigate to such URLs, a user opening View Source could have\ninadvertently leaked their IP address (CVE-2020-35111).\n\nMozilla developer Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in\nThunderbird 78.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and\nwe presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to\nrun arbitrary code (CVE-2020-35113).\n",
