  "details": "The Linux Kernel, the operating system core itself.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nIntel microprocessor generations 6 to 8 are affected by a new Spectre variant that is able to bypass their retpoline mitigation in the kernel to leak arbitrary data. An attacker with unprivileged user access can hijack return instructions to achieve arbitrary speculative code execution under certain microarchitecture-dependent conditions.(CVE-2022-29901)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel Traffic Control (TC) subsystem. Using a specific networking configuration (redirecting egress packets to ingress using TC action &quot;mirred&quot;) a local unprivileged user could trigger a CPU soft lockup (ABBA deadlock) when the transport protocol in use (TCP or SCTP) does a retransmission, resulting in a denial of service condition.(CVE-2022-4269)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free may be triggered in asus_kbd_backlight_set when plugging/disconnecting in a malicious USB device, which advertises itself as an Asus device. Similarly to the previous known CVE-2023-25012, but in asus devices, the work_struct may be scheduled by the LED controller while the device is disconnecting, triggering a use-after-free on the struct asus_kbd_leds *led structure. A malicious USB device may exploit the issue to cause memory corruption with controlled data.(CVE-2023-1079)\r\n\r\n\nKernel: denial of service in tipc_conn_close(CVE-2023-1382)\r\n\r\ndo_tls_getsockopt in net/tls/tls_main.c in the Linux kernel through 6.2.6 lacks a lock_sock call, leading to a race condition (with a resultant use-after-free or NULL pointer dereference).(CVE-2023-28466)\r\n\r\nUse After Free vulnerability in Linux kernel traffic control index filter (tcindex) allows Privilege Escalation. The imperfect hash area can be updated while packets are traversing, which will cause a use-after-free when &apos;tcf_exts_exec()&apos; is called with the destroyed tcf_ext. A local attacker user can use this vulnerability to elevate its privileges to root. This issue affects Linux Kernel: from 4.14 before git commit ee059170b1f7e94e55fa6cadee544e176a6e59c2.(CVE-2023-1281)",
