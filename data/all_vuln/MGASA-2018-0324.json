  "details": "This kernel update is based on the upstream 4.14.56 and fixes at least\nthe following security issues:\n\nkernel KVM before versions kernel 4.16, kernel 4.16-rc7, kernel 4.17-rc1,\nkernel 4.17-rc2 and kernel 4.17-rc3 is vulnerable to a flaw in the way the\nLinux kernel's KVM hypervisor handled exceptions delivered after a stack\nswitch operation via Mov SS or Pop SS instructions. During the stack switch\noperation, the processor did not deliver interrupts and exceptions, rather\nthey are delivered once the first instruction after the stack switch is\nexecuted. An unprivileged KVM guest user could use this flaw to crash the\nguest or, potentially, escalate their privileges in the guest\n(CVE-2018-1087).\n\nLinux kernel vhost since version 4.8 does not properly initialize memory in\nmessages passed between virtual guests and the host operating system in the\nvhost/vhost.c:vhost_new_msg() function. This can allow local privileged\nusers to read some kernel memory contents when reading from the\n/dev/vhost-net device file (CVE-2018-1118).\n\nIn some circumstances, some operating systems or hypervisors may not expect\nor properly handle an Intel architecture hardware debug exception. The error\nappears to be due to developer interpretation of existing documentation for\ncertain Intel architecture interrupt/exception instructions, namely MOV SS\nand POP SS. An authenticated attacker may be able to read sensitive data in\nmemory or control low-level operating system functions (CVE-2018-8897).\n\nLinux kernel is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the \nfs/ext4/xattr.c:ext4_xattr_set_entry() function. An attacker could exploit\nthis by operating on a mounted crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-10840).\n\nA flaw was found in Linux kernel ext4 File System. A use-after-free in\next4_ext_remove_space() when mounting and operating a crafted ext4 image\n(CVE-2018-10876).\n\nLinux kernel ext4 filesystem is vulnerable to an out-of-bound access in the\next4_ext_drop_refs() function when operating on a crafted ext4 filesystem\nimage (CVE-2018-10877).\n\nA flaw was found in Linux kernel ext4 filesystem. A local user can cause a\nuse-after-free in ext4_xattr_set_entry function and so a denial of service\nor possibly unspecified other impact by when renaming a file in a crafted\next4 filesystem image (CVE-2018-10879).\n\nA flaw was found in Linux kernel ext4 filesystem code. A stack-out-of-bounds\nwrite in ext4_update_inline_data() is possible when mounting and writing to\na crafted ext4 image. An attacker could use this to cause  a system crash\nand a denial of service (CVE-2018-10880).\n\nA flaw was found in Linux kernel ext4 filesystem. A local user can cause an\nout-of-bound access in ext4_get_group_info function and so a denial of\nservice and a system crash by mounting and operating on a crafted ext4\nfilesystem image (CVE-2018-10881).\n\nA flaw was found in Linux kernel ext4 File System. An out-of-bound write\nwhen unmounting a crafted ext4 image in fs/jbd2/transaction.c. An attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) (CVE-2018-10882).\n\nA flaw was found in Linux kernel ext4 File System. An out-of-bound write in\njbd2_journal_dirty_metadata() that kernel cannot handle when mounting and\noperating a crafted ext4 image. An attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) (CVE-2018-10883).\n\nIn the Linux kernel 4.13 through 4.16.11, ext4_read_inline_data() in\nfs/ext4/inline.c performs a memcpy with an untrusted length value in certain\ncircumstances involving a crafted filesystem that stores the system.data\nextended attribute value in a dedicated inode (CVE-2018-11412).\n\nThe inode_init_owner function in fs/inode.c in the Linux kernel through\n4.17.4 allows local users to create files with an unintended group\nownership, in a scenario where a directory is SGID to a certain group and\nis writable by a user who is not a member of that group. Here, the\nnon-member can trigger creation of a plain file whose group ownership is\nthat group. The intended behavior was that the non-member can trigger\ncreation of a directory (but not a plain file) whose group ownership is\nthat group. The non-member can escalate privileges by making the plain\nfile executable and SGID (CVE-2018-13405).\n\nOther changes in this update:\n\n* WireGuard has been updated to 0.0.20180708.\n* enable Mellanox5 support (mga#23263)\n* enable SMARTPQI support (mga#23305)\n* ext4: check for allocation block validity with block group locked,\n  fixes possible data corruption under heavy load\n* Add PCI ID for Cannon Lake PCH-LP and Ice Lake LP AHCI\n\nFor other upstream fixes in this update, see the referenced changelogs.\n",
