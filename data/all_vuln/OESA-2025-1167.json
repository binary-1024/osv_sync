This flaw allows a malicious user to randomly cause an uninitialized buffer length variable with a zeroed buffer to be returned in FIPS mode. It may also be possible to force a false positive match between non-equal hashes when comparing a trusted computed hmac sum to an untrusted input sum if an attacker can send a zeroed buffer in place of a pre-computed sum.  It is also possible to force a derived key to be all zeros instead of an unpredictable value.  This may have follow-on implications for the Go TLS stack.(CVE-2024-9355)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"etcd","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/etcd&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.4.14-15.oe2403sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["etcd-3.4.14-15.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["etcd-3.4.14-15.oe2403sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["etcd-3.4.14-15.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1167.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-1167"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9355"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
