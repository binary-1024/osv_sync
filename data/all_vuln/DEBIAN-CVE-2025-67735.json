In versions prior to 4.1.129.Final and 4.2.8.Final, the `io.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpRequestEncoder` has a CRLF injection with the request URI when constructing a request. This leads to request smuggling when `HttpRequestEncoder` is used without proper sanitization of the URI. Any application / framework using `HttpRequestEncoder` can be subject to be abused to perform request smuggling using CRLF injection. Versions 4.1.129.Final and 4.2.8.Final fix the issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"netty","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/netty?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:4.1.48-10","1:4.1.48-11","1:4.1.48-12","1:4.1.48-13","1:4.1.48-14","1:4.1.48-4","1:4.1.48-4+deb11u1","1:4.1.48-4+deb11u2","1:4.1.48-5","1:4.1.48-6","1:4.1.48-7","1:4.1.48-8","1:4.1.48-9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-67735.json"}},{"package":{"name":"netty","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/netty?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:4.1.48-10","1:4.1.48-11","1:4.1.48-12","1:4.1.48-13","1:4.1.48-14","1:4.1.48-7","1:4.1.48-7+deb12u1","1:4.1.48-8","1:4.1.48-9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-67735.json"}},{"package":{"name":"netty","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/netty?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:4.1.48-10","1:4.1.48-11","1:4.1.48-12","1:4.1.48-13","1:4.1.48-14"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-67735.json"}},{"package":{"name":"netty","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/netty?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:4.1.48-10","1:4.1.48-11","1:4.1.48-12","1:4.1.48-13","1:4.1.48-14"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-67735.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-67735"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
