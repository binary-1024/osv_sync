It causes use-after-free bug. Moreover, if alloc_skb() fails, urb->context becomes NULL but rx_buf is not freed and there can be a memory leak.  The patch removes unnecessary nskb and makes skb processing more clear: it is supposed that ath9k_htc_rx_msg() either frees old skb or passes its managing to another callback function.
