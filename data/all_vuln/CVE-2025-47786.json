Version 2.5.13 has a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that allows any registered user to construct malicious JavaScript, inducing all website users to click. In `/admin/comment.php`, the parameter `perpage_num` is not validated and is directly stored in the `admin_commend_perpage_num` field of the `emlog_options` table in the database. Moreover, the output is not filtered, resulting in the direct output of malicious code. As of time of publication, it is unclear if a patch exists.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-47786.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/emlog/emlog/security/advisories/GHSA-82qc-9vg7-2c6c"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:A/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N/E:P"}]}
