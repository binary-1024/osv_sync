{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49771","published":"2025-05-01T15:16:00Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:15:58.139165Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-49771"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dm ioctl: fix misbehavior if list_versions races with module loading  __list_versions will first estimate the required space using the \"dm_target_iterate(list_version_get_needed, &needed)\" call and then will fill the space using the \"dm_target_iterate(list_version_get_info, &iter_info)\" call. Each of these calls locks the targets using the \"down_read(&_lock)\" and \"up_read(&_lock)\" calls, however between the first and second \"dm_target_iterate\" there is no lock held and the target modules can be loaded at this point, so the second \"dm_target_iterate\" call may need more space than what was the first \"dm_target_iterate\" returned.  The code tries to handle this overflow (see the beginning of list_version_get_info), however this handling is incorrect.  The code sets \"param->data_size = param->data_start + needed\" and \"iter_info.end = (char *)vers+len\" - \"needed\" is the size returned by the first dm_target_iterate call; \"len\" is the size of the buffer allocated by userspace.  \"len\" may be greater than \"needed\"; in this case, the code will write up to \"len\" bytes into the buffer, however param->data_size is set to \"needed\", so it may write data past the param->data_size value. The ioctl interface copies only up to param->data_size into userspace, thus part of the result will be truncated.  Fix this bug by setting \"iter_info.end = (char *)vers + needed;\" - this guarantees that the second \"dm_target_iterate\" call will write only up to the \"needed\" buffer and it will exit with \"DM_BUFFER_FULL_FLAG\" if it overflows the \"needed\" space - in this case, userspace will allocate a larger buffer and retry.  Note that there is also a bug in list_version_get_needed - we need to add \"strlen(tt->name) + 1\" to the needed size, not \"strlen(tt->name)\".","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.158-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.103-1","5.10.103-1~bpo10+1","5.10.106-1","5.10.113-1","5.10.120-1","5.10.120-1~bpo10+1","5.10.127-1","5.10.127-2","5.10.127-2~bpo10+1","5.10.136-1","5.10.140-1","5.10.148-1","5.10.149-1","5.10.149-2","5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1","5.10.92-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49771.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49771.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49771.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49771.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-49771"}]}
