It includes support to read, modify and write XML and HTML files. There is DTDs support this includes parsing and validation even with complex DtDs, either at parse time or later once the document has been modified. The output can be a simple SAX stream or and in-memory DOM like representations. In this case one can use the built-in XPath and XPointer implementation to select sub nodes or ranges. A flexible Input/Output mechanism is available, with existing HTTP and FTP modules and combined to an URI library.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA use-after-free vulnerability was found in libxml2. This issue occurs when parsing XPath elements under certain circumstances when the XML schematron has the &lt;sch:name path=&quot;...&quot;/&gt; schema elements. This flaw allows a malicious actor to craft a malicious XML document used as input for libxml, resulting in the program&apos;s crash using libxml or other possible undefined behaviors.(CVE-2025-49794)\n\nA NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was found in libxml2 when processing XPath XML expressions. This flaw allows an attacker to craft a malicious XML input to libxml2, leading to a denial of service.(CVE-2025-49795)\n\nA vulnerability was found in libxml2. Processing certain sch:name elements from the input XML file can trigger a memory corruption issue. This flaw allows an attacker to craft a malicious XML input file that can lead libxml to crash, resulting in a denial of service or other possible undefined behavior due to sensitive data being corrupted in memory.(CVE-2025-49796)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libxml2","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/libxml2&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.11.5-8.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libxml2-2.11.5-8.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","libxml2-debuginfo-2.11.5-8.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","libxml2-debugsource-2.11.5-8.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","libxml2-devel-2.11.5-8.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","python3-libxml2-2.11.5-8.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["libxml2-help-2.11.5-8.oe2403.noarch.rpm"],"src":["libxml2-2.11.5-8.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libxml2-2.11.5-8.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","libxml2-debuginfo-2.11.5-8.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","libxml2-debugsource-2.11.5-8.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","libxml2-devel-2.11.5-8.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","python3-libxml2-2.11.5-8.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1768.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-1768"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49794"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49795"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49796"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Critical"}}
