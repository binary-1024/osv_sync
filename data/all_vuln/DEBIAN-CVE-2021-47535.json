Unfortunately, we didn't change the memory allocation for the array. That leads to a KASAN warning (this was on the chromeos-5.4 kernel, which has the problematic commit backported to it):    BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in _a6xx_get_gmu_registers+0x144/0x430   Write of size 8 at addr ffffff80c89432b0 by task A618-worker/209   CPU: 5 PID: 209 Comm: A618-worker Tainted: G        W         5.4.156-lockdep #22   Hardware name: Google Lazor Limozeen without Touchscreen (rev5 - rev8) (DT)   Call trace:    dump_backtrace+0x0/0x248    show_stack+0x20/0x2c    dump_stack+0x128/0x1ec    print_address_description+0x88/0x4a0    __kasan_report+0xfc/0x120    kasan_report+0x10/0x18    __asan_report_store8_noabort+0x1c/0x24    _a6xx_get_gmu_registers+0x144/0x430    a6xx_gpu_state_get+0x330/0x25d4    msm_gpu_crashstate_capture+0xa0/0x84c    recover_worker+0x328/0x838    kthread_worker_fn+0x32c/0x574    kthread+0x2dc/0x39c    ret_from_fork+0x10/0x18    Allocated by task 209:    __kasan_kmalloc+0xfc/0x1c4    kasan_kmalloc+0xc/0x14    kmem_cache_alloc_trace+0x1f0/0x2a0    a6xx_gpu_state_get+0x164/0x25d4    msm_gpu_crashstate_capture+0xa0/0x84c    recover_worker+0x328/0x838    kthread_worker_fn+0x32c/0x574    kthread+0x2dc/0x39c    ret_from_fork+0x10/0x18","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.84-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47535.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.15.15-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47535.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.15.15-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47535.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.15.15-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47535.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-47535"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
