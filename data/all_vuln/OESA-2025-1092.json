The purpose of Infinispan is to expose a data structure that is highly concurrent, designed ground-up to make the most of modern multi-processor/multi-core architectures while at the same time providing distributed cache capabilities.  At its core Infinispan exposes a Cache interface which extends java.util.Map. It is also optionally is backed by a peer-to-peer network architecture to distribute state efficiently around a data grid.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability was found in Infinispan such that the invokeAccessibly method from the public class ReflectionUtil allows any application class to invoke private methods in any class with Infinispan s privileges. The attacker can use reflection to introduce new, malicious behavior into the application.(CVE-2019-10174)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"infinispan","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/infinispan&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.2.4-13.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"noarch":["infinispan-8.2.4-13.oe2403.noarch.rpm","infinispan-help-8.2.4-13.oe2403.noarch.rpm"],"src":["infinispan-8.2.4-13.oe2403.src.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1092.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-1092"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10174"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
