  "details": "Infinispan is an extremely scalable, highly available data grid platform - 100% open source, and written in Java. The purpose of Infinispan is to expose a data structure that is highly concurrent, designed ground-up to make the most of modern multi-processor/multi-core architectures while at the same time providing distributed cache capabilities.  At its core Infinispan exposes a Cache interface which extends java.util.Map. It is also optionally is backed by a peer-to-peer network architecture to distribute state efficiently around a data grid.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability was found in Infinispan such that the invokeAccessibly method from the public class ReflectionUtil allows any application class to invoke private methods in any class with Infinispan s privileges. The attacker can use reflection to introduce new, malicious behavior into the application.(CVE-2019-10174)",
