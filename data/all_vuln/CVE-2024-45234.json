{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-45234","published":"2024-08-24T23:15:04Z","modified":"2025-09-06T13:01:49Z","details":"An issue was discovered in Fort before 1.6.3. A malicious RPKI repository that descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) an ROA or a Manifest containing a signedAttrs encoded in non-canonical form. This bypasses Fort's BER decoder, reaching a point in the code that panics when faced with data not encoded in DER. Because Fort is an RPKI Relying Party, a panic can lead to Route Origin Validation unavailability, which can lead to compromised routing.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nicmx.github.io/FORT-validator/CVE.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
