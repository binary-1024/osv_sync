  "details": "Updated ntp packages fix security vulnerability:\n\nA flaw was found in the way ntpd processed certain remote configuration\npackets. An attacker could use a specially crafted package to cause ntpd to\ncrash if the attacker had authenticated access to remote ntpd configuration\n(CVE-2015-5146).\n\nIt was found that ntpd could crash due to an uninitialized variable when\nprocessing malformed logconfig configuration commands, for example,\nntpq -c \":config logconfig a\" (CVE-2015-5194).\n\nIt was found that ntpd exits with a segmentation fault when a statistics\ntype that was not enabled during compilation (e.g. timingstats) is\nreferenced by the statistics or filegen configuration command, for example,\nntpq -c ':config statistics timingstats'\nntpq -c ':config filegen timingstats' (CVE-2015-5195).\n\nIt was found that the :config command can be used to set the pidfile and\ndriftfile paths without any restrictions. A remote attacker could use\nthis flaw to overwrite a file on the file system with a file containing\nthe pid of the ntpd process (immediately) or the current estimated drift\nof the system clock (in hourly intervals). For example,\nntpq -c ':config pidfile /tmp/ntp.pid'\nntpq -c ':config driftfile /tmp/ntp.drift' (CVE-2015-5196).\n\nIt was discovered that sntp would hang in an infinite loop when a\ncrafted NTP packet was received, related to the conversion of the\nprecision value in the packet to double (CVE-2015-5219).\n",
