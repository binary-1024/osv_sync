  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/cio: fix out-of-bounds access on cio_ignore free  The channel-subsystem-driver scans for newly available devices whenever device-IDs are removed from the cio_ignore list using a command such as:    echo free >/proc/cio_ignore  Since an I/O device scan might interfer with running I/Os, commit 172da89ed0ea (\"s390/cio: avoid excessive path-verification requests\") introduced an optimization to exclude online devices from the scan.  The newly added check for online devices incorrectly assumes that an I/O-subchannel's drvdata points to a struct io_subchannel_private. For devices that are bound to a non-default I/O subchannel driver, such as the vfio_ccw driver, this results in an out-of-bounds read access during each scan.  Fix this by changing the scan logic to rely on a driver-independent online indication. For this we can use struct subchannel->config.ena, which is the driver's requested subchannel-enabled state. Since I/Os can only be started on enabled subchannels, this matches the intent of the original optimization of not scanning devices where I/O might be running.",
