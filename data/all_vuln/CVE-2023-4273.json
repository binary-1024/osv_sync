The vulnerability exists in the implementation of the file name reconstruction function, which is responsible for reading file name entries from a directory index and merging file name parts belonging to one file into a single long file name. Since the file name characters are copied into a stack variable, a local privileged attacker could use this flaw to overflow the kernel stack.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:6583"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4273"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2221609"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://dfir.ru/2023/08/23/cve-2023-4273-a-vulnerability-in-the-linux-exfat-driver/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0002/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5480"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5492"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00027.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/344H6HO6SSC4KT7PDFXSDIXKMKHISSGF/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3TYLSJ2SAI7RF56ZLQ5CQWCJLVJSD73Q/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
