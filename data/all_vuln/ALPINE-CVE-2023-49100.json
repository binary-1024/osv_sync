The input parameter passed in register x1 is not validated well enough in the function sdei_interrupt_bind. The parameter is passed to a call to plat_ic_get_interrupt_type. It can be any arbitrary value passing checks in the function plat_ic_is_sgi. A compromised Normal World (Linux kernel) can enable a root-privileged attacker to issue arbitrary SMC calls. Using this primitive, he can control the content of registers x0 through x6, which are used to send parameters to TF-A. Out-of-bounds addresses can be read in the context of TF-A (EL3). Because the read value is never returned to non-secure memory or in registers, no leak is possible. An attacker can still crash TF-A, however.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"arm-trusted-firmware","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/arm-trusted-firmware?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.8.14-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.1-r0","2.2-r0","2.3-r0","2.5-r0","2.5-r1","2.5-r2","2.5-r3","2.6-r0","2.6-r1","2.7.0-r0","2.7.0-r1","2.7.0-r2","2.7.0-r3","2.8.0-r0","2.8.0-r1","2.8.0-r2","2.8.6-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-49100.json"}},{"package":{"name":"arm-trusted-firmware","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/arm-trusted-firmware?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.8.14-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.1-r0","2.2-r0","2.3-r0","2.5-r0","2.5-r1","2.5-r2","2.5-r3","2.6-r0","2.6-r1","2.7.0-r0","2.7.0-r1","2.7.0-r2","2.7.0-r3","2.8.0-r0","2.8.0-r1","2.8.0-r2","2.8.12-r0","2.8.13-r0","2.8.6-r0","2.8.8-r0","2.8.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-49100.json"}},{"package":{"name":"arm-trusted-firmware","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/arm-trusted-firmware?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.8.14-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.1-r0","2.2-r0","2.3-r0","2.5-r0","2.5-r1","2.5-r2","2.5-r3","2.6-r0","2.6-r1","2.7.0-r0","2.7.0-r1","2.7.0-r2","2.7.0-r3","2.8.0-r0","2.8.0-r1","2.8.0-r2","2.8.12-r0","2.8.13-r0","2.8.6-r0","2.8.8-r0","2.8.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-49100.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2023-49100"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
