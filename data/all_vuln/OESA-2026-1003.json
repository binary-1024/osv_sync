The GIMP offers many tools and filters, and provides a large image manipulation toolbox, including channel operations and layers, effects, subpixel imaging and antialiasing, and conversions, together with multilevel undo. The GIMP offers a scripting facility, but many of the included scripts rely on fonts that we cannot distribute.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability has been found in GIMP (Image Processing Software) and classified as critical. The CWE definition for the vulnerability is CWE-122. A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc(). As an impact it is known to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Applying the patch 03575ac8cbb0ef3103b0a15d6598475088dcc15e is able to eliminate this problem.(CVE-2025-15059)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gimp","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/gimp&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.0.2-7.oe2403sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["gimp-3.0.2-7.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","gimp-debuginfo-3.0.2-7.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","gimp-debugsource-3.0.2-7.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","gimp-devel-3.0.2-7.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","gimp-extension-goat-excercises-3.0.2-7.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","gimp-libs-3.0.2-7.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","gimp-plugin-aa-3.0.2-7.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","gimp-plugin-python3-3.0.2-7.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","gimp-vala-3.0.2-7.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["gimp-3.0.2-7.oe2403sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["gimp-3.0.2-7.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","gimp-debuginfo-3.0.2-7.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","gimp-debugsource-3.0.2-7.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","gimp-devel-3.0.2-7.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","gimp-extension-goat-excercises-3.0.2-7.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","gimp-libs-3.0.2-7.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","gimp-plugin-aa-3.0.2-7.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","gimp-plugin-python3-3.0.2-7.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","gimp-vala-3.0.2-7.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2026-1003.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2026-1003"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-15059"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
