{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2019-17075","published":"2019-10-01T21:15:11Z","modified":"2025-08-09T19:01:28Z","details":"An issue was discovered in write_tpt_entry in drivers/infiniband/hw/cxgb4/mem.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.2. The cxgb4 driver is directly calling dma_map_single (a DMA function) from a stack variable. This could allow an attacker to trigger a Denial of Service, exploitable if this driver is used on an architecture for which this stack/DMA interaction has security relevance.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155212/Slackware-Security-Advisory-Slackware-14.2-kernel-Updates.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/03/msg00001.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Nov/11"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4208-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4210-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4211-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4211-2/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4226-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20191001165611.GA3542072%40kroah.com"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
