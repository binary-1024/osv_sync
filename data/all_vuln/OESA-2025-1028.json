It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++ (or other languages, depending on the chosen implementation). Python is also usable as an extension language for applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use scripting or automation interfaces.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nThe urllib.parse.urlsplit() and urlparse() functions improperly validated bracketed hosts (`[]`), allowing hosts that weren&apos;t IPv6 or IPvFuture. This behavior was not conformant to RFC 3986 and potentially enabled SSRF if a URL is processed by more than one URL parser.(CVE-2024-11168)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python3&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.9.9-36.oe2203sp3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python3-3.9.9-36.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","python3-debug-3.9.9-36.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.9.9-36.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.9.9-36.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","python3-devel-3.9.9-36.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","python3-unversioned-command-3.9.9-36.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["python3-help-3.9.9-36.oe2203sp3.noarch.rpm"],"src":["python3-3.9.9-36.oe2203sp3.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python3-3.9.9-36.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","python3-debug-3.9.9-36.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.9.9-36.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.9.9-36.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","python3-devel-3.9.9-36.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","python3-unversioned-command-3.9.9-36.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1028.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-1028"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-11168"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Low"}}
