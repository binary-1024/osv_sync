  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  misc: fastrpc: Fix use-after-free and race in fastrpc_map_find  Currently, there is a race window between the point when the mutex is unlocked in fastrpc_map_lookup and the reference count increasing (fastrpc_map_get) in fastrpc_map_find, which can also lead to use-after-free.  So lets merge fastrpc_map_find into fastrpc_map_lookup which allows us to both protect the maps list by also taking the &fl->lock spinlock and the reference count, since the spinlock will be released only after. Add take_ref argument to make this suitable for all callers.",
