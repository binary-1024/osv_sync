  "details": "XSS via `.py` file containing script tag interpreted as HTML\n\n## Summary\n\nA vulnerability exists in the file preview/browsing feature of the application, where files with a `.py` extension that contain JavaScript code wrapped in `<script>` tags may be interpreted and executed as HTML in certain modes. This leads to a stored XSS vulnerability.\n\n## Affected Versions\n\n* <= 4.0.0-rc.3\n\n## PoC\n\nCreate a `.py` file with arbitrary JavaScript content wrapped in `<script>` tags. For example:\n\n```javascript\n<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>\n```\n\nWhen a victim views the file in browsing mode (e.g., a rendered preview), the JavaScript is executed in the browser context.\n\n--- \n\n## Attack vector\n\nAn attacker can place such a `.py` file in the system via remote channels, such as:\n* Convincing a webmaster to download or upload the file; \n* Tricking users into accessing a file link via public URLs.\n\n## Required permissions\n\n* None, if public or visitor access is enabled.\n* If the file is uploaded by a user with elevated permissions, potential privilege boundaries may be crossed.\n\n## User interaction\n\nYes. The user must manually click to switch to the browsing or preview mode to trigger the script. And seems only when using `ISO-8859-1` encoding.\n\n## Scope\n\n* Unchanged `(S:U)` - The attack does not cross system or privilege boundaries in general.\n* \u26a0\ufe0f Controversial edge case: If sensitive preview files are accessible due to misconfiguration, scope could be considered Changed `(S:C)`.\n\n## Impact\n\n* Confidentiality: User information including cookies, login state, and localStorage may be accessed. Some files that only can be viewed via this user will leak too.\n* Integrity & Availability: Not directly impacted.\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations\n\n* Treat all previewed file types (including non-HTML like .py) as plain text unless explicitly sanitized.\n* Disable rendering modes that can interpret user-uploaded content as HTML.\n\n## Timeline\n\n| Date | Event |\n|------|-------|\n| 2025-06-17 | Vulnerability reported |\n| 2025-06-17 | Comminuty Manager confirmed |\n| 2025-06-17 | Fixed |\n\n# Credits\n\n* Discovered by: @zyk2507\n* Reported to: [The OpenList Team](https://github.com/OpenListTeam)\n* Analyzed and confirmed by: @jyxjjj\n* Fixed by: @cxw620\n* Fixed in: `4.0.0-rc.4`",
