{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50740","published":"2025-12-24T13:16:00.703Z","modified":"2025-12-25T11:10:49.858937Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-50740"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath9k: hif_usb: fix memory leak of urbs in ath9k_hif_usb_dealloc_tx_urbs()  Syzkaller reports a long-known leak of urbs in ath9k_hif_usb_dealloc_tx_urbs().  The cause of the leak is that usb_get_urb() is called but usb_free_urb() (or usb_put_urb()) is not called inside usb_kill_urb() as urb->dev or urb->ep fields have not been initialized and usb_kill_urb() returns immediately.  The patch removes trying to kill urbs located in hif_dev->tx.tx_buf because hif_dev->tx.tx_buf is not supposed to contain urbs which are in pending state (the pending urbs are stored in hif_dev->tx.tx_pending). The tx.tx_lock is acquired so there should not be any changes in the list.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.178-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.103-1","5.10.103-1~bpo10+1","5.10.106-1","5.10.113-1","5.10.120-1","5.10.120-1~bpo10+1","5.10.127-1","5.10.127-2","5.10.127-2~bpo10+1","5.10.136-1","5.10.140-1","5.10.148-1","5.10.149-1","5.10.149-2","5.10.158-1","5.10.158-2","5.10.162-1","5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1","5.10.92-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50740.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.4-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50740.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.4-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50740.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.4-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50740.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-50740"}]}
