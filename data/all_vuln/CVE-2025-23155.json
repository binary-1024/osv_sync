  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: stmmac: Fix accessing freed irq affinity_hint\n\nIn stmmac_request_irq_multi_msi(), a pointer to the stack variable\ncpu_mask is passed to irq_set_affinity_hint(). This value is stored in\nirq_desc->affinity_hint, but once stmmac_request_irq_multi_msi()\nreturns, the pointer becomes dangling.\n\nThe affinity_hint is exposed via procfs with S_IRUGO permissions,\nallowing any unprivileged process to read it. Accessing this stale\npointer can lead to:\n\n- a kernel oops or panic if the referenced memory has been released and\n  unmapped, or\n- leakage of kernel data into userspace if the memory is re-used for\n  other purposes.\n\nAll platforms that use stmmac with PCI MSI (Intel, Loongson, etc) are\naffected.",
