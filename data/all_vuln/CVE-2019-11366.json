It does not lock the thread_list_mutex mutex before assigning the current thread data structure. As a result, the daemon is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to a NULL pointer dereference. If thread_data is NULL when assigned to current, and modified by another thread before a certain tftpd_list.c check, there is a crash when dereferencing current->next.","references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/advisories/atftpd-multiple-vulnerabilities"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202003-14"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://sourceforge.net/p/atftp/code/ci/382f76a90b44f81fec00e2f609a94def4a5d3580/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4438"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/05/msg00012.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/May/16"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4540-1/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
