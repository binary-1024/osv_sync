This could lead to out-of-bounds read access and potentially,\nmemory corruption, CVE-2025-4087.\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 137, Thunderbird 137, Firefox ESR\n128.9, and Thunderbird 128.9. Some of these bugs showed evidence of\nmemory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these\ncould have been exploited to run arbitrary code, CVE-2025-4091.\nMemory safety bug present in Firefox ESR 128.9, and Thunderbird 128.9.\nThis bug showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with\nenough effort this could have been exploited to run arbitrary code,\nCVE-2025-4093.\n",
