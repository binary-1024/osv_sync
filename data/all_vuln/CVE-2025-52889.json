When using an ACL on a device connected to a bridge, Incus version 6.12 and 6.13 generates nftables rules for local services (DHCP, DNS...) that partially bypass security options `security.mac_filtering`, `security.ipv4_filtering` and `security.ipv6_filtering`. This can lead to DHCP pool exhaustion and opens the door for other attacks.
