{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-24783","published":"2026-01-27T22:04:18.006Z","modified":"2026-01-29T06:51:05.804541Z","aliases":["GHSA-x5m4-43jf-hh65"],"summary":"soroban-fixed-point-math has Incorrect Rounding and Overflow Handling in Signed Fixed-Point Math with Negatives","details":"soroban-fixed-point-math is a fixed-point math library for Soroban smart contacts. In versions 1.3.0 and 1.4.0, the `mulDiv(x, y, z)` function incorrectly handled cases where both the intermediate product $x * y$ and the divisor $z$ were negative. The logic assumed that if the intermediate product was negative, the final result must also be negative, neglecting the sign of $z$. This resulted in rounding being applied in the wrong direction for cases where both $x * y$ and $z$ were negative. The functions most at risk are `fixed_div_floor` and `fixed_div_ceil`, as they often use non-constant numbers as the divisor $z$ in `mulDiv`.  This error is present in all signed `FixedPoint` and `SorobanFixedPoint` implementations, including `i64`, `i128`, and `I256`. Versions 1.3.1 and 1.4.1 contain a patch. No known workarounds for this issue are available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/script3/soroban-fixed-point-math","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c9233f7094198a49ed66a4d75786a8a3755c936a"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24783.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24783.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/script3/soroban-fixed-point-math/commit/c9233f7094198a49ed66a4d75786a8a3755c936a"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/script3/soroban-fixed-point-math/releases/tag/v1.3.1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/script3/soroban-fixed-point-math/releases/tag/v1.4.1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/script3/soroban-fixed-point-math/security/advisories/GHSA-x5m4-43jf-hh65"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24783"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-682"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24783.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
