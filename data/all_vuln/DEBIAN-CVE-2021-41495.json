NOTE: While correct that validation is missing, an error can only occur due to an exhaustion of memory. If the user can exhaust memory, they are already privileged. Further, it should be practically impossible to construct an attack which can target the memory exhaustion to occur at exactly this place","affected":[{"package":{"name":"numpy","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/numpy?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:1.19.5-1","1:1.20.0-1","1:1.20.2-1","1:1.21.2-1","1:1.21.2-2","1:1.21.2-3","1:1.21.4-1","1:1.21.4-2","1:1.21.5-1","1:1.21.5-2","1:1.22.1-1","1:1.23.1-1","1:1.23.2-1","1:1.23.3-1","1:1.23.5-1","1:1.23.5-2","1:1.24.0-1","1:1.24.1-1","1:1.24.1-2","1:1.24.2-1","1:1.24.2-1~hurd.1","1:1.24.2-2","1:1.24.2-2+hurd.1","1:1.24.2-3","1:1.26.3-1","1:1.26.3-2","1:1.26.4+ds-1","1:1.26.4+ds-10","1:1.26.4+ds-11","1:1.26.4+ds-12","1:1.26.4+ds-13","1:1.26.4+ds-2","1:1.26.4+ds-3","1:1.26.4+ds-4","1:1.26.4+ds-5","1:1.26.4+ds-6","1:1.26.4+ds-7","1:1.26.4+ds-8","1:1.26.4+ds-9","1:1.26.4+ds-9~exp1","1:2.1.0+ds-1","1:2.1.0+ds-2","1:2.1.1+ds-1","1:2.1.1+ds-2","1:2.1.1+ds-3","1:2.1.2+ds-1","1:2.1.3+ds-1","1:2.1.3+ds-2","1:2.2.0+ds-1","1:2.2.1+ds-1","1:2.2.1+ds-2","1:2.2.2+ds-1","1:2.2.2+ds-2","1:2.2.3+ds-1","1:2.2.3+ds-2","1:2.2.3+ds-3","1:2.2.3+ds-4","1:2.2.3+ds-5","1:2.2.4+ds-1","1:2.2.4+ds-1.1","1:2.2.4+ds-1.2","1:2.3.2+ds-1","1:2.3.3+ds-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-41495.json"}},{"package":{"name":"numpy","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/numpy?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:1.24.2-1","1:1.24.2-1+deb12u1","1:1.24.2-2","1:1.24.2-2+hurd.1","1:1.24.2-3","1:1.26.3-1","1:1.26.3-2","1:1.26.4+ds-1","1:1.26.4+ds-10","1:1.26.4+ds-11","1:1.26.4+ds-12","1:1.26.4+ds-13","1:1.26.4+ds-2","1:1.26.4+ds-3","1:1.26.4+ds-4","1:1.26.4+ds-5","1:1.26.4+ds-6","1:1.26.4+ds-7","1:1.26.4+ds-8","1:1.26.4+ds-9","1:1.26.4+ds-9~exp1","1:2.1.0+ds-1","1:2.1.0+ds-2","1:2.1.1+ds-1","1:2.1.1+ds-2","1:2.1.1+ds-3","1:2.1.2+ds-1","1:2.1.3+ds-1","1:2.1.3+ds-2","1:2.2.0+ds-1","1:2.2.1+ds-1","1:2.2.1+ds-2","1:2.2.2+ds-1","1:2.2.2+ds-2","1:2.2.3+ds-1","1:2.2.3+ds-2","1:2.2.3+ds-3","1:2.2.3+ds-4","1:2.2.3+ds-5","1:2.2.4+ds-1","1:2.2.4+ds-1.1","1:2.2.4+ds-1.2","1:2.3.2+ds-1","1:2.3.3+ds-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-41495.json"}},{"package":{"name":"numpy","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/numpy?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:2.2.4+ds-1","1:2.2.4+ds-1.1","1:2.2.4+ds-1.2","1:2.3.2+ds-1","1:2.3.3+ds-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-41495.json"}},{"package":{"name":"numpy","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/numpy?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:2.2.4+ds-1","1:2.2.4+ds-1.1","1:2.2.4+ds-1.2","1:2.3.2+ds-1","1:2.3.3+ds-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-41495.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-41495"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
