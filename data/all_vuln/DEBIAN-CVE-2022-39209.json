{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-39209","published":"2022-09-15T18:15:12Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:17:14.273157Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-39209"],"details":"cmark-gfm is GitHub's fork of cmark, a CommonMark parsing and rendering library and program in C. In versions prior to 0.29.0.gfm.6 a polynomial time complexity issue in cmark-gfm's autolink extension may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service. Users may verify the patch by running `python3 -c 'print(\"![l\"* 100000 + \"\\n\")' | ./cmark-gfm -e autolink`, which will resource exhaust on unpatched cmark-gfm but render correctly on patched cmark-gfm. This vulnerability has been patched in 0.29.0.gfm.6. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable the use of the autolink extension.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"cmark-gfm","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/cmark-gfm?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.29.0.gfm.0-6","0.29.0.gfm.13-1","0.29.0.gfm.13-2","0.29.0.gfm.13-3","0.29.0.gfm.13-4","0.29.0.gfm.13-7","0.29.0.gfm.2-1","0.29.0.gfm.2-2","0.29.0.gfm.3-3","0.29.0.gfm.6-2","0.29.0.gfm.6-2.1","0.29.0.gfm.6-3","0.29.0.gfm.6-4","0.29.0.gfm.6-5","0.29.0.gfm.6-6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not
