When processing extremely long passwords, an internal size calculation can overflow due to improper use of signed integers. This results in incorrect memory allocation on the stack, followed by unsafe memory copying. As a result, applications using libsoup may crash unexpectedly, creating a denial-of-service risk.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libsoup2.4","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libsoup2.4?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.72.0-2","2.72.0-2+deb11u1","2.72.0-2+deb11u2","2.72.0-2+deb11u3","2.72.0-3","2.72.0-4","2.74.0-1","2.74.0-2","2.74.0-3","2.74.1-1","2.74.2-1","2.74.2-2","2.74.2-3","2.74.3-1","2.74.3-10","2.74.3-10.1","2.74.3-11","2.74.3-2","2.74.3-3","2.74.3-3.1~exp1","2.74.3-3.1~exp2","2.74.3-3.1~exp3","2.74.3-5","2.74.3-6","2.74.3-7","2.74.3-8","2.74.3-8.1","2.74.3-9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-0719.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libsoup2.4","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libsoup2.4?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.74.3-1","2.74.3-1+deb12u1","2.74.3-10","2.74.3-10.1","2.74.3-11","2.74.3-2","2.74.3-3","2.74.3-3.1~exp1","2.74.3-3.1~exp2","2.74.3-3.1~exp3","2.74.3-5","2.74.3-6","2.74.3-7","2.74.3-8","2.74.3-8.1","2.74.3-9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-0719.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libsoup2.4","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libsoup2.4?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.74.3-10.1","2.74.3-11"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-0719.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libsoup3","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libsoup3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.2.2-2","3.2.3-0+deb12u1","3.2.3-0+deb12u2","3.3.1-1","3.4.0-1","3.4.1-1","3.4.2-1","3.4.2-2","3.4.2-3","3.4.2-4","3.4.3-1","3.4.4-1","3.4.4-2","3.4.4-3","3.4.4-4","3.4.4-5","3.5.2-1","3.6.0-1","3.6.0-2","3.6.0-3","3.6.0-4","3.6.1-1","3.6.4-1","3.6.4-2","3.6.4-3","3.6.5-1","3.6.5-2","3.6.5-3","3.6.5-4","3.6.5-5","3.6.5-6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-0719.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libsoup3","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libsoup3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.6.5-3","3.6.5-4","3.6.5-5","3.6.5-6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-0719.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libsoup3","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libsoup3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.6.5-3","3.6.5-4","3.6.5-5","3.6.5-6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-0719.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2026-0719"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
