The resolution introduces a new Required Permission for referencing remote resources, restricting configuration of these components to privileged users. The permission prevents unprivileged users from configuring Processors and Controller Services annotated with the new Reference Remote Resources restriction. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 1.23.0 is the recommended mitigation.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nifi","ecosystem":"Bitnami","purl":"pkg:bitnami/nifi"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.2"},{"last_affected":"1.22.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/bitnami/vulndb/tree/main/data/nifi/BIT-nifi-2023-36542.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/43"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/29/1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/swnly3dzhhq9zo3rofc8djq77stkhbof"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://nifi.apache.org/security.html#CVE-2023-36542"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36542"}],"database_specific":{"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:apache:nifi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"severity":"High"}}
