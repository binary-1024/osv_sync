  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tipc: wait and exit until all work queues are done  On some host, a crash could be triggered simply by repeating these commands several times:    # modprobe tipc   # tipc bearer enable media udp name UDP1 localip 127.0.0.1   # rmmod tipc    [] BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffffffffc096bb00   [] Workqueue: events 0xffffffffc096bb00   [] Call Trace:   []  ? process_one_work+0x1a7/0x360   []  ? worker_thread+0x30/0x390   []  ? create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0   []  ? kthread+0x116/0x130   []  ? kthread_flush_work_fn+0x10/0x10   []  ? ret_from_fork+0x35/0x40  When removing the TIPC module, the UDP tunnel sock will be delayed to release in a work queue as sock_release() can't be done in rtnl_lock(). If the work queue is schedule to run after the TIPC module is removed, kernel will crash as the work queue function cleanup_beareri() code no longer exists when trying to invoke it.  To fix it, this patch introduce a member wq_count in tipc_net to track the numbers of work queues in schedule, and  wait and exit until all work queues are done in tipc_exit_net().",
