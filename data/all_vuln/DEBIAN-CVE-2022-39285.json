This then allows a malicious user to provide code that will execute when a user views the specific log on the \"view=log\" page. This vulnerability allows an attacker to store code within the logs that will be executed when loaded by a legitimate user. These actions will be performed with the permission of the victim. This could lead to data loss and/or further exploitation including account takeover. This issue has been addressed in versions `1.36.27` and `1.37.24`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable database logging.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"zoneminder","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/zoneminder?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.34.23-1","1.36.10+dfsg1-1","1.36.11+dfsg1-1","1.36.11+dfsg1-1~bpo11+1","1.36.12+dfsg1-1","1.36.13+dfsg1-1","1.36.14+dfsg1-1","1.36.14+dfsg1-1~bpo11+1","1.36.15+dfsg1-1","1.36.17+dfsg1-1","1.36.19+dfsg1-1","1.36.24+dfsg1-1","1.36.24+dfsg1-1~bpo11+1","1.36.26+dfsg1-1","1.36.26+dfsg1-1~bpo11+1","1.36.31+dfsg1-1","1.36.32+dfsg1-1","1.36.33+dfsg1-1","1.36.35+dfsg1-1","1.36.5+dfsg1-1","1.36.7+dfsg1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-39285.json"}},{"package":{"name":"zoneminder","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/zoneminder?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.36.31+dfsg1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-39285.json"}},{"package":{"name":"zoneminder","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/zoneminder?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.36.31+dfsg1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-39285.json"}},{"package":{"name":"zoneminder","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/zoneminder?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.36.31+dfsg1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-39285.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39285"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
