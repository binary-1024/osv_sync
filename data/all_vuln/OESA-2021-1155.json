This flaw allows an attacker who can provide a crafted input file to cairo&apos;s image-compositor (for example, by convincing a user to open a file in an application using cairo, or if an application uses cairo on untrusted input) to cause a stack buffer overflow -&gt; out-of-bounds WRITE. The highest impact from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-35492)",
