Versions 2.12 and prior contain a stack buffer overflow vulnerability that affects PJSUA2 users or users that call the API `pjmedia_sdp_print(), pjmedia_sdp_media_print()`. Applications that do not use PJSUA2 and do not directly call `pjmedia_sdp_print()` or `pjmedia_sdp_media_print()` should not be affected. A patch is available on the `master` branch of the `pjsip/pjproject` GitHub repository. There are currently no known workarounds.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"pjproject","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/pjproject?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.12.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.1-r0","1.10-r0","1.4-r0","1.4-r1","1.6-r0","1.6-r1","1.6-r2","2.0-r0","2.1-r0","2.11-r0","2.11.1-r0","2.11.1-r1","2.11.1-r2","2.12-r0","2.2-r0","2.2.1-r0","2.3-r0","2.4-r0","2.4.5-r0","2.5.5-r0","2.5.5-r1","2.5.5-r2","2.5.5-r3","2.5.5-r4","2.7.2-r0","2.7.2-r1","2.7.2-r2","2.7.2-r3","2.7.2-r4","2.8-r0","2.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-24764.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pjproject","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/pjproject?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.12.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.1-r0","1.10-r0","1.4-r0","1.4-r1","1.6-r0","1.6-r1","1.6-r2","2.0-r0","2.1-r0","2.11-r0","2.11.1-r0","2.11.1-r1","2.11.1-r2","2.12-r0","2.2-r0","2.2.1-r0","2.3-r0","2.4-r0","2.4.5-r0","2.5.5-r0","2.5.5-r1","2.5.5-r2","2.5.5-r3","2.5.5-r4","2.7.2-r0","2.7.2-r1","2.7.2-r2","2.7.2-r3","2.7.2-r4","2.8-r0","2.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-24764.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pjproject","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/pjproject?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.12.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.1-r0","1.10-r0","1.4-r0","1.4-r1","1.6-r0","1.6-r1","1.6-r2","2.0-r0","2.1-r0","2.11-r0","2.11.1-r0","2.11.1-r1","2.11.1-r2","2.12-r0","2.2-r0","2.2.1-r0","2.3-r0","2.4-r0","2.4.5-r0","2.5.5-r0","2.5.5-r1","2.5.5-r2","2.5.5-r3","2.5.5-r4","2.7.2-r0","2.7.2-r1","2.7.2-r2","2.7.2-r3","2.7.2-r4","2.8-r0","2.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-24764.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pjproject","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/pjproject?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.12.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.1-r0","1.10-r0","1.4-r0","1.4-r1","1.6-r0","1.6-r1","1.6-r2","2.0-r0","2.1-r0","2.11-r0","2.11.1-r0","2.11.1-r1","2.11.1-r2","2.12-r0","2.2-r0","2.2.1-r0","2.3-r0","2.4-r0","2.4.5-r0","2.5.5-r0","2.5.5-r1","2.5.5-r2","2.5.5-r3","2.5.5-r4","2.7.2-r0","2.7.2-r1","2.7.2-r2","2.7.2-r3","2.7.2-r4","2.8-r0","2.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-24764.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pjproject","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/pjproject?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.12.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.1-r0","1.10-r0","1.4-r0","1.4-r1","1.6-r0","1.6-r1","1.6-r2","2.0-r0","2.1-r0","2.11-r0","2.11.1-r0","2.11.1-r1","2.11.1-r2","2.12-r0","2.2-r0","2.2.1-r0","2.3-r0","2.4-r0","2.4.5-r0","2.5.5-r0","2.5.5-r1","2.5.5-r2","2.5.5-r3","2.5.5-r4","2.7.2-r0","2.7.2-r1","2.7.2-r2","2.7.2-r3","2.7.2-r4","2.8-r0","2.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-24764.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pjproject","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/pjproject?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.12.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.1-r0","1.10-r0","1.4-r0","1.4-r1","1.6-r0","1.6-r1","1.6-r2","2.0-r0","2.1-r0","2.11-r0","2.11.1-r0","2.11.1-r1","2.11.1-r2","2.12-r0","2.2-r0","2.2.1-r0","2.3-r0","2.4-r0","2.4.5-r0","2.5.5-r0","2.5.5-r1","2.5.5-r2","2.5.5-r3","2.5.5-r4","2.7.2-r0","2.7.2-r1","2.7.2-r2","2.7.2-r3","2.7.2-r4","2.8-r0","2.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-24764.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pjproject","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/pjproject?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.12.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.1-r0","1.10-r0","1.4-r0","1.4-r1","1.6-r0","1.6-r1","1.6-r2","2.0-r0","2.1-r0","2.11-r0","2.11.1-r0","2.11.1-r1","2.11.1-r2","2.12-r0","2.2-r0","2.2.1-r0","2.3-r0","2.4-r0","2.4.5-r0","2.5.5-r0","2.5.5-r1","2.5.5-r2","2.5.5-r3","2.5.5-r4","2.7.2-r0","2.7.2-r1","2.7.2-r2","2.7.2-r3","2.7.2-r4","2.8-r0","2.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-24764.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2022-24764"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
