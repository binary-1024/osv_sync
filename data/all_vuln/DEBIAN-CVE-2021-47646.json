{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47646","published":"2025-02-26T06:37:06Z","modified":"2025-10-14T04:25:31.986653Z","upstream":["CVE-2021-47646"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert \"Revert \"block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges\"\"  A crash [1] happened to be triggered in conjunction with commit 2d52c58b9c9b (\"block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges\"). The latter was then reverted by commit ebc69e897e17 (\"Revert \"block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges\"\"). Yet, the reverted commit was not the one introducing the bug. In fact, it actually triggered a UAF introduced by a different commit, and now fixed by commit d29bd41428cf (\"block, bfq: reset last_bfqq_created on group change\").  So, there is no point in keeping commit 2d52c58b9c9b (\"block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges\") out. This commit restores it.
