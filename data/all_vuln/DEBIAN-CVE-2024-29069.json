{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-29069","published":"2024-07-25T20:15:04Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:18:21.094177Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-29069"],"details":"In snapd versions prior to 2.62, snapd failed to properly check the destination of symbolic links when extracting a snap. The snap format  is a squashfs file-system image and so can contain symbolic links and other file types. Various file entries within the snap squashfs image (such as icons and desktop files etc) are directly read by snapd when it is extracted. An attacker who could convince a user to install a malicious snap which contained symbolic links at these paths could then  cause snapd to write out the contents of the symbolic link destination into a world-readable directory. This in-turn could allow an unprivileged user to gain access to privileged information.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"snapd","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/snapd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.49-1","2.49-1+deb11u1","2.49-1+deb11u2","2.51.7-1","2.51.7-2","2.54.1-1","2.54.3-1","2.54.3-1.1","2.57.6-1","2.59.5-1","2.60.2-1","2.61.1-1","2.61.2-1","2.61.2-2","2.62-1","2.62-2","2.62-3","2.62-4","2.62-5","2.63-1","2.63-2","2.63-3","2.63-4","2.65.1-1","2.65.3-1","2.66.1-1","2.66.1-2","2.67-1","2.68.3-2","2.68.3-3","2.71-1","2.71-2","2.71-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-29069.json"}},{"package":{"name":"snapd","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/snapd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.57.6-1","2.59.5-1","2.60.2-1","2.61.1-1","2.61.2-1","2.61.2-2","2.62-1","2.62-2","2.62-3","2.62-4","2.62-5","2.63-1","2.63-2","2.63-3","2.63-4","2.65.1-1","2.65.3-1","2.66.1-1","2.66.1-2","2.67-1","2.68.3-2","2.68.3-3","2.71-1","2.71-2","2.71-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-29069.json"}},{"package":{"name":"snapd","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/snapd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.62-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-29069.json"}},{"package":{"name":"snapd","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/snapd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.62-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-29069.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-29069"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
