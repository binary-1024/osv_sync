This allows non-root users to mount a FUSE file system with the 'allow_other' mount option regardless of whether 'user_allow_other' is set in the fuse configuration. An attacker may use this flaw to mount a FUSE file system, accessible by other users, and trick them into accessing files on that file system, possibly causing Denial of Service or other unspecified effects.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"fuse","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/fuse?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.8.1-r0","2.8.1-r1","2.8.4-r0","2.8.5-r0","2.8.5-r1","2.8.5-r2","2.8.6-r0","2.8.7-r0","2.9.0-r0","2.9.1-r0","2.9.1-r1","2.9.2-r0","2.9.3-r0","2.9.3-r1","2.9.3-r2","2.9.3-r3","2.9.4-r0","2.9.4-r1","2.9.4-r2","2.9.6-r0","2.9.7-r0","2.9.7-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-10906.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fuse","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/fuse?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.8.1-r0","2.8.1-r1","2.8.4-r0","2.8.5-r0","2.8.5-r1","2.8.5-r2","2.8.6-r0","2.8.7-r0","2.9.0-r0","2.9.1-r0","2.9.1-r1","2.9.2-r0","2.9.3-r0","2.9.3-r1","2.9.3-r2","2.9.3-r3","2.9.4-r0","2.9.4-r1","2.9.4-r2","2.9.6-r0","2.9.7-r0","2.9.7-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-10906.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fuse","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/fuse?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.8.1-r0","2.8.1-r1","2.8.4-r0","2.8.5-r0","2.8.5-r1","2.8.5-r2","2.8.6-r0","2.8.7-r0","2.9.0-r0","2.9.1-r0","2.9.1-r1","2.9.2-r0","2.9.3-r0","2.9.3-r1","2.9.3-r2","2.9.3-r3","2.9.4-r0","2.9.4-r1","2.9.4-r2","2.9.6-r0","2.9.7-r0","2.9.7-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-10906.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fuse","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/fuse?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.8.1-r0","2.8.1-r1","2.8.4-r0","2.8.5-r0","2.8.5-r1","2.8.5-r2","2.8.6-r0","2.8.7-r0","2.9.0-r0","2.9.1-r0","2.9.1-r1","2.9.2-r0","2.9.3-r0","2.9.3-r1","2.9.3-r2","2.9.3-r3","2.9.4-r0","2.9.4-r1","2.9.4-r2","2.9.6-r0","2.9.7-r0","2.9.7-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-10906.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fuse","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/fuse?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.8.1-r0","2.8.1-r1","2.8.4-r0","2.8.5-r0","2.8.5-r1","2.8.5-r2","2.8.6-r0","2.8.7-r0","2.9.0-r0","2.9.1-r0","2.9.1-r1","2.9.2-r0","2.9.3-r0","2.9.3-r1","2.9.3-r2","2.9.3-r3","2.9.4-r0","2.9.4-r1","2.9.4-r2","2.9.6-r0","2.9.7-r0","2.9.7-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-10906.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fuse","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/fuse?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.8.1-r0","2.8.1-r1","2.8.4-r0","2.8.5-r0","2.8.5-r1","2.8.5-r2","2.8.6-r0","2.8.7-r0","2.9.0-r0","2.9.1-r0","2.9.1-r1","2.9.2-r0","2.9.3-r0","2.9.3-r1","2.9.3-r2","2.9.3-r3","2.9.4-r0","2.9.4-r1","2.9.4-r2","2.9.6-r0","2.9.7-r0","2.9.7-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-10906.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fuse","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/fuse?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.8.1-r0","2.8.1-r1","2.8.4-r0","2.8.5-r0","2.8.5-r1","2.8.5-r2","2.8.6-r0","2.8.7-r0","2.9.0-r0","2.9.1-r0","2.9.1-r1","2.9.2-r0","2.9.3-r0","2.9.3-r1","2.9.3-r2","2.9.3-r3","2.9.4-r0","2.9.4-r1","2.9.4-r2","2.9.6-r0","2.9.7-r0","2.9.7-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-10906.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fuse","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/fuse?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.8.1-r0","2.8.1-r1","2.8.4-r0","2.8.5-r0","2.8.5-r1","2.8.5-r2","2.8.6-r0","2.8.7-r0","2.9.0-r0","2.9.1-r0","2.9.1-r1","2.9.2-r0","2.9.3-r0","2.9.3-r1","2.9.3-r2","2.9.3-r3","2.9.4-r0","2.9.4-r1","2.9.4-r2","2.9.6-r0","2.9.7-r0","2.9.7-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-10906.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fuse","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/fuse?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.8.1-r0","2.8.1-r1","2.8.4-r0","2.8.5-r0","2.8.5-r1","2.8.5-r2","2.8.6-r0","2.8.7-r0","2.9.0-r0","2.9.1-r0","2.9.1-r1","2.9.2-r0","2.9.3-r0","2.9.3-r1","2.9.3-r2","2.9.3-r3","2.9.4-r0","2.9.4-r1","2.9.4-r2","2.9.6-r0","2.9.7-r0","2.9.7-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-10906.json"}},{"package":{"name":
