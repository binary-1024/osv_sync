{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-21925","published":"2025-04-01T16:15:23Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:20:17.156878Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-21925"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  llc: do not use skb_get() before dev_queue_xmit()  syzbot is able to crash hosts [1], using llc and devices not supporting IFF_TX_SKB_SHARING.  In this case, e1000 driver calls eth_skb_pad(), while the skb is shared.  Simply replace skb_get() by skb_clone() in net/llc/llc_s_ac.c  Note that e1000 driver might have an issue with pktgen, because it does not clear IFF_TX_SKB_SHARING, this is an orthogonal change.  We need to audit other skb_get() uses in net/llc.  [1]  kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c:2178 !
