Holding a reference to an inode is not allowed unless we ensure the superblock stays alive, which fsnotify does by keeping the watched_objects count elevated, so iput() must happen before the watched_objects decrement. This can lead to a UAF of something like sb->s_fs_info in tmpfs, but the UAF is hard to hit because race orderings that oops are more likely, thanks to the CHECK_DATA_CORRUPTION() block in generic_shutdown_super().  Also, ensure that fsnotify_put_sb_watched_objects() doesn't call fsnotify_sb_watched_objects() on a superblock that may have already been freed, which would cause a UAF read of sb->s_fsnotify_info.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-53143.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-53143.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-53143"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
