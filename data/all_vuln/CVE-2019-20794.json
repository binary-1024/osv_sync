A user can create their own PID namespace, and mount a FUSE filesystem. Upon interaction with this FUSE filesystem, if the userspace component is terminated via a kill of the PID namespace's pid 1, it will result in a hung task, and resources being permanently locked up until system reboot. This can result in resource exhaustion.","references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/08/24/1"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/sargun/fuse-example"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200608-0001/"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://sourceforge.net/p/fuse/mailman/message/36598753/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
