This vulnerability affects Firefox &amp;lt; 134, Firefox ESR &amp;lt; 128.6, and Firefox ESR &amp;lt; 115.19.(CVE-2025-0238)\r\n\r\nWhen using Alt-Svc, ALPN did not properly validate certificates when the original server is redirecting to an insecure site. This vulnerability affects Firefox &amp;lt; 134 and Firefox ESR &amp;lt; 128.6.(CVE-2025-0239)\r\n\r\nParsing a JavaScript module as JSON could, under some circumstances, cause cross-compartment access, which may result in a use-after-free. This vulnerability affects Firefox &amp;lt; 134 and Firefox ESR &amp;lt; 128.6.(CVE-2025-0240)\r\n\r\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 133, Thunderbird 133, Firefox ESR 128.5, and Thunderbird 128.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox &amp;lt; 134 and Firefox ESR &amp;lt; 128.6.(CVE-2025-0243)",
