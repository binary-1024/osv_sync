This vulnerability affects Firefox &amp;lt; 134, Firefox ESR &amp;lt; 128.6, and Firefox ESR &amp;lt; 115.19.(CVE-2025-0238)\r\n\r\nWhen using Alt-Svc, ALPN did not properly validate certificates when the original server is redirecting to an insecure site. This vulnerability affects Firefox &amp;lt; 134 and Firefox ESR &amp;lt; 128.6.(CVE-2025-0239)\r\n\r\nParsing a JavaScript module as JSON could, under some circumstances, cause cross-compartment access, which may result in a use-after-free.
