Specifically, the fields usbdev_intf0 and usbdev_intf1 are not protected by the users counter (ictx->users). During probe, imon_init_intf0 or imon_init_intf1 increments the usb_device reference count depending on the interface. However, during disconnect, usb_put_dev is called unconditionally, regardless of actual usage.  As a result, if vfd_write or other operations are still in progress after disconnect, this can lead to a use-after-free of the usb_device pointer.

Add early return with -ENODEV in send_packet(), vfd_write(), lcd_write() and display_open() if the device is no longer present.  Set and read ictx->disconnected under ictx->lock to ensure memory synchronization. Acquire the lock in imon_disconnect() before setting the flag to synchronize with any ongoing operations.  Ensure writers exit early and safely after disconnect before the USB core proceeds with cleanup.
