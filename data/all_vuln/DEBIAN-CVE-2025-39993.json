Specifically, the fields usbdev_intf0 and usbdev_intf1 are not protected by the users counter (ictx->users). During probe, imon_init_intf0 or imon_init_intf1 increments the usb_device reference count depending on the interface. However, during disconnect, usb_put_dev is called unconditionally, regardless of actual usage.  As a result, if vfd_write or other operations are still in progress after disconnect, this can lead to a use-after-free of the usb_device pointer.  Thread 1 vfd_write                      Thread 2 imon_disconnect                                         ...                                         if                                           usb_put_dev(ictx->usbdev_intf0)                                         else                                           usb_put_dev(ictx->usbdev_intf1) ... while   send_packet     if       pipe = usb_sndintpipe(         ictx->usbdev_intf0) UAF     else       pipe = usb_sndctrlpipe(         ictx->usbdev_intf0, 0) UAF  Guard access to usbdev_intf0 and usbdev_intf1 after disconnect by checking ictx->disconnected in all writer paths. Add early return with -ENODEV in send_packet(), vfd_write(), lcd_write() and display_open() if the device is no longer present.  Set and read ictx->disconnected under ictx->lock to ensure memory synchronization. Acquire the lock in imon_disconnect() before setting the flag to synchronize with any ongoing operations.  Ensure writers exit early and safely after disconnect before the USB core proceeds with cleanup.
