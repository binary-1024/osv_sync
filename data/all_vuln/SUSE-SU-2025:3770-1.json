The problem is that livepatch packages for already released kernels  are built in exactly the same build environment as the initial livepatch.  The BS (Build Service) installs the build environment using the given  _buildinfo-*.xml and ignores BuildRequires. But the BuildRequires are  later checked by rpmbuild tool. It would complain when new dependencies  were added.  Unfortunately, kernel-syms-rt does not exist on SLE16. This was the main  motivation for the above mentioned commit.  But the package kernel-syms is empty. Its only purpose is to add other  dependencies. Replace it by opencoding the dependencies.  Note that the kernel devel files are historically split into various  packages, kernel-&lt;flavor&gt;-devel, kernel-devel-&lt;flavor&gt;, and  even kernel-devel. But it is enough to require kernel-&lt;flavor&gt;-devel  because it requires the other devel files on its own. This seems  to be true back to SLE15-SP4 at minimum.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kernel-livepatch-SLE15-SP6_Update_14","ecosystem":"SUSE:Linux Enterprise Live Patching 15 SP6","purl":"pkg:rpm/suse/kernel-livepatch-SLE15-SP6_Update_14&distro=SUSE%20Linux%20Enterprise%20Live%20Patching%2015%20SP6"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2-150600.2.1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"kernel-livepatch-6_4_0-150600_23_65-default":"2-150600.2.1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/security/osv/SUSE-SU-2025:3770-1.json"}},{"package":{"name":"kernel-livepatch-SLE15-SP7_Update_3","ecosystem":"SUSE:Linux Enterprise Live Patching 15 SP7","purl":"pkg:rpm/suse/kernel-livepatch-SLE15-SP7_Update_3&distro=SUSE%20Linux%20Enterprise%20Live%20Patching%2015%20SP7"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2-150700.2.1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"kernel-livepatch-6_4_0-150700_53_11-default":"2-150700.2.1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/security/osv/SUSE-SU-2025:3770-1.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.suse.com/support/update/announcement/2025/suse-su-20253770-1/"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.suse.com/1248108"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.suse.com/1248376"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.suse.com/1248673"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.suse.com/1249534"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-38499"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-38566"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-38678"}]}
