  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: storvsc: Fix handling of virtual Fibre Channel timeouts  Hyper-V provides the ability to connect Fibre Channel LUNs to the host system and present them in a guest VM as a SCSI device. I/O to the vFC device is handled by the storvsc driver. The storvsc driver includes a partial integration with the FC transport implemented in the generic portion of the Linux SCSI subsystem so that FC attributes can be displayed in /sys.  However, the partial integration means that some aspects of vFC don't work properly. Unfortunately, a full and correct integration isn't practical because of limitations in what Hyper-V provides to the guest.  In particular, in the context of Hyper-V storvsc, the FC transport timeout function fc_eh_timed_out() causes a kernel panic because it can't find the rport and dereferences a NULL pointer. The original patch that added the call from storvsc_eh_timed_out() to fc_eh_timed_out() is faulty in this regard.  In many cases a timeout is due to a transient condition, so the situation can be improved by just continuing to wait like with other I/O requests issued by storvsc, and avoiding the guaranteed panic. For a permanent failure, continuing to wait may result in a hung thread instead of a panic, which again may be better.  So fix the panic by removing the storvsc call to fc_eh_timed_out().  This allows storvsc to keep waiting for a response.  The change has been tested by users who experienced a panic in fc_eh_timed_out() due to transient timeouts, and it solves their problem.  In the future we may want to deprecate the vFC functionality in storvsc since it can't be fully fixed. But it has current users for whom it is working well enough, so it should probably stay for a while longer.",
