The root cause is udp_abort() racing with close(). Both racing functions acquire the socket lock, but udp{v6}_destroy_sock() release it before performing destructive actions.  We can't easily extend the socket lock scope to avoid the race, instead use the SOCK_DEAD flag to prevent udp_abort from doing any action when the critical race happens.
