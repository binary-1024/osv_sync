{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53713","published":"2025-10-22T14:15:45Z","modified":"2025-10-23T09:03:37.729750Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-53713"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: sme: Use STR P to clear FFR context field in streaming SVE mode  The FFR is a predicate register which can vary between 16 and 256 bits in size depending upon the configured vector length. When saving the SVE state in streaming SVE mode, the FFR register is inaccessible and so commit 9f5848665788 (\"arm64/sve: Make access to FFR optional\") simply clears the FFR field of the in-memory context structure. Unfortunately, it achieves this using an unconditional 8-byte store and so if the SME vector length is anything other than 64 bytes in size we will either fail to clear the entire field or, worse, we will corrupt memory immediately following the structure. This has led to intermittent kfence splats in CI [1] and can trigger kmalloc Redzone corruption messages when running the 'fp-stress' kselftest:   | =============================================================================  | BUG kmalloc-1k (Not tainted): kmalloc Redzone overwritten  | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |  | 0xffff000809bf1e22-0xffff000809bf1e27 @offset=7714.

Replace the 8-byte store with a store of a predicate register which has been zero-initialised with PFALSE, ensuring that the entire field is cleared in memory.
