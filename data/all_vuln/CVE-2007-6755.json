{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2007-6755","published":"2013-10-11T22:55:33Z","modified":"2025-08-09T19:01:26Z","details":"The NIST SP 800-90A default statement of the Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generation (Dual_EC_DRBG) algorithm contains point Q constants with a possible relationship to certain \"skeleton key\" values, which might allow context-dependent attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging knowledge of those values.  NOTE: this is a preliminary CVE for Dual_EC_DRBG; future research may provide additional details about point Q and associated attacks, and could potentially lead to a RECAST or REJECT of this CVE.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/09/stop-using-nsa-influence-code-in-our-product-rsa-tells-customers/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/rsa-warns-developers-against-its-own.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/the-many-flaws-of-dualecdrbg.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://rump2007.cr.yp.to/15-shumow.pdf"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://threatpost.com/in-wake-of-latest-crypto-revelations-everything-is-suspect"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/63657"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/11/the_strange_sto.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://stream.wsj.com/story/latest-headlines/SS-2-63399/SS-2-332655/"}]}
