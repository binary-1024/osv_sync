Under specific timing conditions, buffers allocated with `Buffer.alloc` and other `TypedArray` instances like `Uint8Array` may contain leftover data from previous operations, allowing in-process secrets like tokens or passwords to leak or causing data corruption. While exploitation typically requires precise timing or in-process code execution, it can become remotely exploitable when untrusted input influences workload and timeouts, leading to potential confidentiality and integrity impact.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nodejs","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.23","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nodejs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"24.13.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["22.11.0-r0","22.11.0-r1","22.11.0-r2","22.13.1-r0","22.13.1-r1","22.13.1-r2","22.13.1-r3","22.13.1-r4","22.13.1-r5","22.16.0-r0","22.16.0-r1","22.16.0-r2","22.16.0-r3","22.19.0-r3","22.19.0-r4","22.21.0-r0","24.11.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-55131.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2025-55131"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
