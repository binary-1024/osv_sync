The only way execution between\nnormal/ordered functions is synchronized is via the WORK_DONE_BIT,\nunfortunately the used bitops don&apos;t guarantee any ordering whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThis manifested as seemingly inexplicable crashes on ARM64, where\nasync_chunk::inode is seen as non-null in async_cow_submit which causes\nsubmit_compressed_extents to be called and crash occurs because\nasync_chunk::inode suddenly became NULL. The call trace was similar to:\r\n\r\n    pc : submit_compressed_extents+0x38/0x3d0\n    lr : async_cow_submit+0x50/0xd0\n    sp : ffff800015d4bc20\r\n\r\n    &lt;registers omitted for brevity&gt;\r\n\r\n    Call trace:\n     submit_compressed_extents+0x38/0x3d0\n     async_cow_submit+0x50/0xd0\n     run_ordered_work+0xc8/0x280\n     btrfs_work_helper+0x98/0x250\n     process_one_work+0x1f0/0x4ac\n     worker_thread+0x188/0x504\n     kthread+0x110/0x114\n     ret_from_fork+0x10/0x18\r\n\r\nFix this by adding respective barrier calls which ensure that all\naccesses preceding setting of WORK_DONE_BIT are strictly ordered before\nsetting the flag. At the same time add a read barrier after reading of\nWORK_DONE_BIT in run_ordered_work which ensures all subsequent loads\nwould be strictly ordered after reading the bit. This in turn ensures\nare all accesses before WORK_DONE_BIT are going to be strictly ordered\nbefore any access that can occur in ordered_func.(CVE-2021-47189)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nnet: dpaa2-eth: fix use-after-free in dpaa2_eth_remove\r\n\r\nAccess to netdev after free_netdev() will cause use-after-free bug.\nMove debug log before free_netdev() call to avoid it.(CVE-2021-47204)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nusb: host: ohci-tmio: check return value after calling platform_get_resource()\r\n\r\nIt will cause null-ptr-deref if platform_get_resource() returns NULL,\nwe need check the return value.(CVE-2021-47206)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nvsock: remove vsock from connected table when connect is interrupted by a signal\r\n\r\nvsock_connect() expects that the socket could already be in the\nTCP_ESTABLISHED state when the connecting task wakes up with a signal\npending. If this happens the socket will be in the connected table, and\nit is not removed when the socket state is reset. In this situation it&apos;s\ncommon for the process to retry connect(), and if the connection is\nsuccessful the socket will be added to the connected table a second\ntime, corrupting the list.\r\n\r\nPrevent this by calling vsock_remove_connected() if a signal is received\nwhile waiting for a connection. This is harmless if the socket is not in\nthe connected table, and if it is in the table then removing it will\nprevent list corruption from a double add.\r\n\r\nNote for backporting: this patch requires d5afa82c977e (&quot;vsock: correct\nremoval of socket from the list&quot;), which is in all current stable trees\nexcept 4.9.y.(CVE-2022-48786)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nnet: ieee802154: at86rf230: Stop leaking skb&apos;s\r\n\r\nUpon error the ieee802154_xmit_complete() helper is not called.

While this was happening the driver has\nalready initialized the local epfile in ffs_func_eps_disable\nwhich is now freed and waiting to acquire the spinlock. Once\nspinlock is acquired the driver proceeds with the stale value\nof epfile and tries to free the already freed read buffer\ncausing use-after-free.\r\n\r\nFollowing is the illustration of the race:\r\n\r\n      CPU1                                  CPU2\r\n\r\n   ffs_func_eps_disable\n   epfiles (local copy)\n\t\t\t\t\tffs_epfile_release\n\t\t\t\t\tffs_data_closed\n\t\t\t\t\tif (last file closed)\n\t\t\t\t\tffs_data_reset\n\t\t\t\t\tffs_data_clear\n\t\t\t\t\tffs_epfiles_destroy\nspin_lock\ndereference epfiles\r\n\r\nFix this races by taking epfiles local copy &amp; assigning it under\nspinlock and if epfiles(local) is null then update it in ffs-&gt;epfiles\nthen finally destroy it.\nExtending the scope further from the race, protecting the ep related\nstructures, and concurrent accesses.(CVE-2022-48822)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nNFSD: Fix ia_size underflow\r\n\r\niattr::ia_size is a loff_t, which is a signed 64-bit type. NFSv3 and\nNFSv4 both define file size as an unsigned 64-bit type. Thus there\nis a range of valid file size values an NFS client can send that is\nalready larger than Linux can handle.\r\n\r\nCurrently decode_fattr4() dumps a full u64 value into ia_size. If\nthat value happens to be larger than S64_MAX, then ia_size\nunderflows. I&apos;m about to fix up the NFSv3 behavior as well, so let&apos;s\ncatch the underflow in the common code path: nfsd_setattr().(CVE-2022-48828)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nInput: aiptek - properly check endpoint type\r\n\r\nSyzbot reported warning in usb_submit_urb() which is caused by wrong\nendpoint type.
