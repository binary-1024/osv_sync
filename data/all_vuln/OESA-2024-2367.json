In other words, the Tx buffer data on channel B is corrupted\nwith data from channel A.\r\n\r\nThe problem appeared since commit 4409df5866b7 (&quot;serial: sc16is7xx: change\nEFR lock to operate on each channels&quot;), which changed the EFR locking to\noperate on each channel instead of chip-wise.\r\n\r\nThis commit has introduced a regression, because the EFR lock is used not\nonly to protect the EFR registers access, but also, in a very obscure and\nundocumented way, to protect access to the data buffer, which is shared by\nthe Tx and Rx handlers, but also by each channel of the IC.\r\n\r\nFix this regression first by switching to kfifo_out_linear_ptr() in\nsc16is7xx_handle_tx() to eliminate the need for a shared Rx/Tx buffer.\r\n\r\nSecondly, replace the chip-wise Rx buffer with a separate Rx buffer for\neach channel.(CVE-2024-44951)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nmemcg_write_event_control(): fix a user-triggerable oops\r\n\r\nwe are *not* guaranteed that anything past the terminating NUL\nis mapped (let alone initialized with anything sane).(CVE-2024-45021)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\npinctrl: single: fix potential NULL dereference in pcs_get_function()\r\n\r\npinmux_generic_get_function() can return NULL and the pointer &apos;function&apos;\nwas dereferenced without checking against NULL. Add checking of pointer\n&apos;function&apos; in pcs_get_function().\r\n\r\nFound by code review.(CVE-2024-46685)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nthunderbolt: Mark XDomain as unplugged when router is removed\r\n\r\nI noticed that when we do discrete host router NVM upgrade and it gets\nhot-removed from the PCIe side as a result of NVM firmware authentication,\nif there is another host connected with enabled paths we hang in tearing\nthem down. This is due to fact that the Thunderbolt networking driver\nalso tries to cleanup the paths and ends up blocking in\ntb_disconnect_xdomain_paths() waiting for the domain lock.\r\n\r\nHowever, at this point we already cleaned the paths in tb_stop() so\nthere is really no need for tb_disconnect_xdomain_paths() to do that\nanymore. Furthermore it already checks if the XDomain is unplugged and\nbails out early so take advantage of that and mark the XDomain as\nunplugged when we remove the parent router.(CVE-2024-46702)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nublk_drv: fix NULL pointer dereference in ublk_ctrl_start_recovery()\r\n\r\nWhen two UBLK_CMD_START_USER_RECOVERY commands are submitted, the\nfirst one sets &apos;ubq-&gt;ubq_daemon&apos;

To fix the bug, recheck the inode-&gt;i_count after holding i_lock. Because in the most scenarios, the first check is valid, and the overhead of spin_lock() can be reduced.  If there is any misunderstanding, please let me know, thanks.  [1]: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/000000000000eabe1d0619c48986@google.com/ [2]: The reason might be 1.

This series addresses three potential issues with empty b-tree nodes that can occur with corrupted filesystem images, including one recently discovered by syzbot.   This patch (of 3):  If a b-tree is broken on the device, and the b-tree height is greater than 2 (the level of the root node is greater than 1) even if the number of child nodes of the b-tree root is 0, a NULL pointer dereference occurs in nilfs_btree_prepare_insert(), which is called from nilfs_btree_insert().  This is because, when the number of child nodes of the b-tree root is 0, nilfs_btree_do_lookup() does not set the block buffer head in any of path[x].bp_bh, leaving it as the initial value of NULL, but if the level of the b-tree root node is greater than 1, nilfs_btree_get_nonroot_node(), which accesses the buffer memory of path[x].bp_bh, is called.  Fix this issue by adding a check to nilfs_btree_root_broken(), which performs sanity checks when reading the root node from the device, to detect this inconsistency.

This happens because file system can not filter out the positive number returned by the LSM prog using IS_ERR, and misinterprets this positive number as a file pointer.  Given that hook file_alloc_security never returned positive number before the introduction of BPF LSM, and other BPF LSM hooks may encounter similar issues, this patch adds LSM return value check in verifier, to ensure no unexpected value is returned.(CVE-2024-47703)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Check link_res-&gt;hpo_dp_link_enc before using it  [WHAT &amp; HOW] Functions dp_enable_link_phy and dp_disable_link_phy can pass link_res without initializing hpo_dp_link_enc and it is necessary to check for null before dereferencing.  This fixes 2 FORWARD_NULL issues reported by Coverity.(CVE-2024-47704)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: fix potential invalid pointer dereference in blk_add_partition  The blk_add_partition() function initially used a single if-condition (IS_ERR(part)) to check for errors when adding a partition. This was modified to handle the specific case of -ENXIO separately, allowing the function to proceed without logging the error in this case. However, this change unintentionally left a path where md_autodetect_dev() could be called without confirming that part is a valid pointer.  This commit separates the error handling logic by splitting the initial if-condition, improving code readability and handling specific error scenarios explicitly. The function now distinguishes the general error case from -ENXIO without altering the existing behavior of md_autodetect_dev() calls.(CVE-2024-47705)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommufd: Protect against overflow of ALIGN() during iova allocation  Userspace can supply an iova and uptr such that the target iova alignment becomes really big and ALIGN() overflows which corrupts the selected area range during allocation.

The handle_mmio() function checks if the #VE exception occurred in the kernel and rejects the operation if it did not.  However, userspace can deceive the kernel into performing MMIO on its behalf. For example, if userspace can point a syscall to an MMIO address, syscall does get_user() or put_user() on it, triggering MMIO #VE. The kernel will treat the #VE as in-kernel MMIO.  Ensure that the target MMIO address is within the kernel before decoding instruction.(CVE-2024-47727)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  padata: use integer wrap around to prevent deadlock on seq_nr overflow  When submitting more than 2^32 padata objects to padata_do_serial, the current sorting implementation incorrectly sorts padata objects with overflowed seq_nr, causing them to be placed before existing objects in the reorder list. This leads to a deadlock in the serialization process as padata_find_next cannot match padata-&gt;seq_nr and pd-&gt;processed because the padata instance with overflowed seq_nr will be selected next.  To fix this, we use an unsigned integer wrap around to correctly sort padata objects in scenarios with integer overflow.(CVE-2024-47739)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware_loader: Block path traversal  Most firmware names are hardcoded strings, or are constructed from fairly constrained format strings where the dynamic parts are just some hex numbers or such.  However, there are a couple codepaths in the kernel where firmware file names contain string components that are passed through from a device or semi-privileged userspace; the ones I could find (not counting interfaces that require root privileges) are:   - lpfc_sli4_request_firmware_update() seems to construct the firmware    filename from &quot;ModelName&quot;, a string that was previously parsed out of    some descriptor (&quot;Vital Product Data&quot;) in lpfc_fill_vpd()  - nfp_net_fw_find() seems to construct a firmware filename from a model    name coming from nfp_hwinfo_lookup(pf-&gt;hwinfo, &quot;nffw.partno&quot;), which I    think parses some descriptor that was read from the device.    (But this case likely isn&apos;t exploitable because the format string looks    like &quot;netronome/nic_%s&quot;, and there shouldn&apos;t be any *folders* starting    with &quot;netronome/nic_&quot;. The previous case was different because there,    the &quot;%s&quot; is *at the start* of the format string.)  - module_flash_fw_schedule() is reachable from the    ETHTOOL_MSG_MODULE_FW_FLASH_ACT netlink command, which is marked as    GENL_UNS_ADMIN_PERM (meaning CAP_NET_ADMIN inside a user namespace is    enough to pass the privilege check), and takes a userspace-provided    firmware name.    (But I think to reach this case, you need to have CAP_NET_ADMIN over a    network namespace that a special kind of ethernet device is mapped into,    so I think this is not a viable attack path in practice.)  Fix it by rejecting any firmware names containing &quot;..&quot; path components.  For what it&apos;s worth, I went looking and haven&apos;t found any USB device drivers that use the firmware loader dangerously.(CVE-2024-47742)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: Use dedicated mutex to protect kvm_usage_count to avoid deadlock  Use a dedicated mutex to guard kvm_usage_count to fix a potential deadlock on x86 due to a chain of locks and SRCU synchronizations.  Translating the below lockdep splat, CPU1 #6 will wait on CPU0 #1, CPU0 #8 will wait on CPU2 #3, and CPU2 #7 will wait on CPU1 #4 (if there&apos;s a writer, due to the fairness of r/w semaphores).      CPU0                     CPU1                     CPU2 1   lock(&amp;kvm-&gt;slots_lock); 2                                                     lock(&amp;vcpu-&gt;mutex); 3                                                     lock(&amp;kvm-&gt;srcu); 4                            lock(cpu_hotplug_lock); 5                            lock(kvm_lock); 6                            lock(&amp;kvm-&gt;slots_lock); 7                                                     lock(cpu_hotplug_lock); 8   sync(&amp;kvm-&gt;srcu);  Note, there are likely more potential deadlocks in KVM x86, e.g. the same pattern of taking cpu_hotplug_lock outside of kvm_lock likely exists with __kvmclock_cpufreq_notifier():    cpuhp_cpufreq_online()   |   -&gt; cpufreq_online()      |      -&gt; cpufreq_gov_performance_limits()         |         -&gt; __cpufreq_driver_target()            |            -&gt; __target_index()               |               -&gt; cpufreq_freq_transition_begin()                  |                  -&gt; cpufreq_notify_transition()                     |                     -&gt; ... __kvmclock_cpufreq_notifier()  But, actually triggering such deadlocks is beyond rare due to the combination of dependencies and timings involved.  E.g. the cpufreq notifier is only used on older CPUs without a constant TSC, mucking with the NX hugepage mitigation while VMs are running is very uncommon, and doing so while also onlining/offlining a CPU (necessary to generate contention on cpu_hotplug_lock) would be even more unusual.  The most robust solution to the general cpu_hotplug_lock issue is likely to switch vm_list to be an RCU-protected list, e.g. so that x86&apos;s cpufreq notifier doesn&apos;t to take kvm_lock.  For now, settle for fixing the most blatant deadlock, as switching to an RCU-protected list is a much more involved change, but add a comment in locking.rst to call out that care needs to be taken when walking holding kvm_lock and walking vm_list.    ======================================================   WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected   6.10.0-smp--c257535a0c9d-pip #330 Tainted: G S         O   ------------------------------------------------------   tee/35048 is trying to acquire lock:   ff6a80eced71e0a8 (&amp;kvm-&gt;slots_lock){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: set_nx_huge_pages+0x179/0x1e0 [kvm]    but task is already holding lock:   ffffffffc07abb08 (kvm_lock){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: set_nx_huge_pages+0x14a/0x1e0 [kvm]    which lock already depends on the new lock.     the existing dependency chain (in reverse order) is:    -&gt; #3 (kvm_lock){+.+.}-{3:3}:          __mutex_lock+0x6a/0xb40          mutex_lock_nested+0x1f/0x30          kvm_dev_ioctl+0x4fb/0xe50 [kvm]          __se_sys_ioctl+0x7b/0xd0          __x64_sys_ioctl+0x21/0x30          x64_sys_call+0x15d0/0x2e60          do_syscall_64+0x83/0x160          entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e    -&gt; #2 (cpu_hotplug_lock){++++}-{0:0}:          cpus_read_lock+0x2e/0xb0          static_key_slow_inc+0x16/0x30          kvm_lapic_set_base+0x6a/0x1c0 [kvm]          kvm_set_apic_base+0x8f/0xe0 [kvm]          kvm_set_msr_common+0x9ae/0xf80 [kvm]          vmx_set_msr+0xa54/0xbe0 [kvm_intel]          __kvm_set_msr+0xb6/0x1a0 [kvm]          kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl+0xeca/0x10c0 [kvm]          kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x485/0x5b0 [kvm]          __se_sys_ioctl+0x7b/0xd0          __x64_sys_ioctl+0x21/0x30          x64_sys_call+0x15d0/0x2e60          do_syscall_64+0x83/0x160          entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e    -&gt; #1 (&amp;kvm-&gt;srcu){.+.+}-{0:0}:          __synchronize_srcu+0x44/0x1a0        ---truncated---(CVE-2024-47744)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vhost_vdpa: assign irq bypass producer token correctly  We used to call irq_bypass_unregister_producer() in vhost_vdpa_setup_vq_irq() which is problematic as we don&apos;t know if the token pointer is still valid or not.  Actually, we use the eventfd_ctx as the token so the life cycle of the token should be bound to the VHOST_SET_VRING_CALL instead of vhost_vdpa_setup_vq_irq() which could be called by set_status().  Fixing this by setting up irq bypass producer&apos;s token when handling VHOST_SET_VRING_CALL and un-registering the producer before calling vhost_vring_ioctl() to prevent a possible use after free as eventfd could have been released in vhost_vring_ioctl().

The use of EFI_LOADER_DATA here results in the region being left unreserved in the E820 memory map constructed by the EFI stub, and this is the memory description that is passed on to the incoming kernel by kexec, which is therefore unaware that the region should be reserved.  Even though the utility of the TPM2 event log after a kexec is questionable, any corruption might send the parsing code off into the weeds and crash the kernel.

However, i2c_set_clientdata() is only being set at the end of the probe function which means that we&apos;ll get a NULL pointer dereference in case the probe function fails early.(CVE-2024-49871)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i3c: master: svc: Fix use after free vulnerability in svc_i3c_master Driver Due to Race Condition  In the svc_i3c_master_probe function, &amp;master-&gt;hj_work is bound with svc_i3c_master_hj_work, &amp;master-&gt;ibi_work is bound with svc_i3c_master_ibi_work. And svc_i3c_master_ibi_work  can start the hj_work, svc_i3c_master_irq_handler can start the ibi_work.  If we remove the module which will call svc_i3c_master_remove to make cleanup, it will free master-&gt;base through i3c_master_unregister while the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:  CPU0                                         CPU1                                      | svc_i3c_master_hj_work svc_i3c_master_remove               | i3c_master_unregister(&amp;master-&gt;base)| device_unregister(&amp;master-&gt;dev)     | device_release                      | //free master-&gt;base                 |                                     | i3c_master_do_daa(&amp;master-&gt;base)                                     | //use master-&gt;base  Fix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with the cleanup in svc_i3c_master_remove.(CVE-2024-49874)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ocfs2: fix possible null-ptr-deref in ocfs2_set_buffer_uptodate  When doing cleanup, if flags without OCFS2_BH_READAHEAD, it may trigger NULL pointer dereference in the following ocfs2_set_buffer_uptodate() if bh is NULL.(CVE-2024-49877)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm: omapdrm: Add missing check for alloc_ordered_workqueue  As it may return NULL pointer and cause NULL pointer dereference.

But after reallocating and successfully initializing the path, we don&apos;t update *orig_path, in which case the caller gets a valid path but a NULL ppath, and this may cause a NULL pointer dereference or a path memory leak. For example:  ext4_split_extent   path = *ppath = 2000   ext4_find_extent     if (depth &gt; path[0].p_maxdepth)       kfree(path = 2000);       *orig_path = path = NULL;       path = kcalloc() = 3000   ext4_split_extent_at(*ppath = NULL)     path = *ppath;     ex = path[depth].p_ext;     // NULL pointer dereference!  ================================================================== BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000010 CPU: 6 UID: 0 PID: 576 Comm: fsstress Not tainted 6.11.0-rc2-dirty #847 RIP: 0010:ext4_split_extent_at+0x6d/0x560 Call Trace:  &lt;TASK&gt;  ext4_split_extent.isra.0+0xcb/0x1b0  ext4_ext_convert_to_initialized+0x168/0x6c0  ext4_ext_handle_unwritten_extents+0x325/0x4d0  ext4_ext_map_blocks+0x520/0xdb0  ext4_map_blocks+0x2b0/0x690  ext4_iomap_begin+0x20e/0x2c0 [...] ==================================================================  Therefore, *orig_path is updated when the extent lookup succeeds, so that the caller can safely use path or *ppath.(CVE-2024-49881)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: fix double brelse() the buffer of the extents path  In ext4_ext_try_to_merge_up(), set path[1].p_bh to NULL after it has been released, otherwise it may be released twice.

Similar to ext4_split_extent_at(), we use *ppath directly as an input to ext4_ext_show_leaf(). Fix a spelling error by the way.  Same problem in ext4_ext_handle_unwritten_extents(). Since &apos;path&apos; is only used in ext4_ext_show_leaf(), remove &apos;path&apos; and use *ppath directly.  This issue is triggered only when EXT_DEBUG is defined and therefore does not affect functionality.(CVE-2024-49889)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Initialize get_bytes_per_element&apos;s default to 1  Variables, used as denominators and maybe not assigned to other values, should not be 0. bytes_per_element_y &amp; bytes_per_element_c are initialized by get_bytes_per_element() which should never return 0.

Previously, set_output_gamma was being checked for null, but then it was being dereferenced without any null check. This could lead to a null pointer dereference if set_output_gamma is null.  To fix this, we now ensure that set_output_gamma is not null before dereferencing it. We do this by adding a null check for set_output_gamma before the call to set_output_gamma.(CVE-2024-49909)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Handle null &apos;stream_status&apos; in &apos;planes_changed_for_existing_stream&apos;  This commit adds a null check for &apos;stream_status&apos; in the function &apos;planes_changed_for_existing_stream&apos;. Previously, the code assumed &apos;stream_status&apos; could be null, but did not handle the case where it was actually null. This could lead to a null pointer dereference.

The issue could occur when `dc-&gt;clk_mgr` or `dc-&gt;clk_mgr-&gt;funcs` is null.  The fix adds a check to ensure `dc-&gt;clk_mgr` and `dc-&gt;clk_mgr-&gt;funcs` is not null before accessing its functions. This prevents a potential null pointer dereference.  Reported by smatch: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn30/dcn30_hwseq.c:789 dcn30_init_hw() error: we previously assumed &apos;dc-&gt;clk_mgr&apos; could be null (see line 628)(CVE-2024-49917)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Check null pointers before using them  [WHAT &amp; HOW] These pointers are null checked previously in the same function, indicating they might be null as reported by Coverity. As a result, they need to be checked when used again.  This fixes 3 FORWARD_NULL issue reported by Coverity.(CVE-2024-49922)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fbdev: pxafb: Fix possible use after free in pxafb_task()  In the pxafb_probe function, it calls the pxafb_init_fbinfo function, after which &amp;fbi-&gt;task is associated with pxafb_task. Moreover, within this pxafb_init_fbinfo function, the pxafb_blank function within the &amp;pxafb_ops struct is capable of scheduling work.  If we remove the module which will call pxafb_remove to make cleanup, it will call unregister_framebuffer function which can call do_unregister_framebuffer to free fbi-&gt;fb through put_fb_info(fb_info), while the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:  CPU0                                                CPU1                                     | pxafb_task pxafb_remove                       | unregister_framebuffer(info)       | do_unregister_framebuffer(fb_info) | put_fb_info(fb_info)               | // free fbi-&gt;fb                    | set_ctrlr_state(fbi, state)                                    | __pxafb_lcd_power(fbi, 0)                                    | fbi-&gt;lcd_power(on, &amp;fbi-&gt;fb.var)                                    | //use fbi-&gt;fb  Fix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with the cleanup in pxafb_remove.  Note that only root user can remove the driver at runtime.(CVE-2024-49924)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath12k: fix array out-of-bound access in SoC stats  Currently, the ath12k_soc_dp_stats::hal_reo_error array is defined with a maximum size of DP_REO_DST_RING_MAX. However, the ath12k_dp_rx_process() function access ath12k_soc_dp_stats::hal_reo_error using the REO destination SRNG ring ID, which is incorrect. SRNG ring ID differ from normal ring ID, and this usage leads to out-of-bounds array access. To fix this issue, modify ath12k_dp_rx_process() to use the normal ring ID directly instead of the SRNG ring ID to avoid out-of-bounds array access.

When the session refcount drops to 0, l2tp_session_free drops the tunnel refcount if session-&gt;tunnel is non-NULL. However, session-&gt;tunnel is set in l2tp_session_create, before the tunnel refcount is incremented by l2tp_session_register, which leaves a small window where session-&gt;tunnel is non-NULL when the tunnel refcount hasn&apos;t been bumped.  Moving the assignment to l2tp_session_register is trivial but l2tp_session_create calls l2tp_session_set_header_len which uses session-&gt;tunnel to get the tunnel&apos;s encap. Add an encap arg to l2tp_session_set_header_len to avoid using session-&gt;tunnel.  If l2tpv3 sessions have colliding IDs, it is possible for l2tp_v3_session_get to race with l2tp_session_register and fetch a session which doesn&apos;t yet have session-&gt;tunnel set. Add a check for this case.(CVE-2024-49940)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  static_call: Replace pointless WARN_ON() in static_call_module_notify()  static_call_module_notify() triggers a WARN_ON(), when memory allocation fails in __static_call_add_module().  That&apos;s not really justified, because the failure case must be correctly handled by the well known call chain and the error code is passed through to the initiating userspace application.  A memory allocation fail is not a fatal problem, but the WARN_ON() takes the machine out when panic_on_warn is set.  Replace it with a pr_warn().(CVE-2024-49954)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ACPI: battery: Fix possible crash when unregistering a battery hook  When a battery hook returns an error when adding a new battery, then the battery hook is automatically unregistered. However the battery hook provider cannot know that, so it will later call battery_hook_unregister() on the already unregistered battery hook, resulting in a crash.  Fix this by using the list head to mark already unregistered battery hooks as already being unregistered so that they can be ignored by battery_hook_unregister().(CVE-2024-49955)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ocfs2: reserve space for inline xattr before attaching reflink tree  One of our customers reported a crash and a corrupted ocfs2 filesystem.

The issue was in the reflink workfow while reserving space for inline xattr.  The problematic function is ocfs2_reflink_xattr_inline().  By the time this function is called the reflink tree is already recreated at the destination inode from the source inode.  At this point, this function reserves space for inline xattrs at the destination inode without even checking if there is space at the root metadata block.  It simply reduces the l_count from 243 to 227 thereby making space of 256 bytes for inline xattr whereas the inode already has extents beyond this index (in this case up to 230), thereby causing corruption.  The fix for this is to reserve space for inline metadata at the destination inode before the reflink tree gets recreated. The customer has verified the fix.(CVE-2024-49958)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: fix timer use-after-free on failed mount  Syzbot has found an ODEBUG bug in ext4_fill_super  The del_timer_sync function cancels the s_err_report timer, which reminds about filesystem errors daily. We should guarantee the timer is no longer active before kfree(sbi).  When filesystem mounting fails, the flow goes to failed_mount3, where an error occurs when ext4_stop_mmpd is called, causing a read I/O failure. This triggers the ext4_handle_error function that ultimately re-arms the timer, leaving the s_err_report timer active before kfree(sbi) is called.  Fix the issue by canceling the s_err_report timer after calling ext4_stop_mmpd.(CVE-2024-49960)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: i2c: ar0521: Use cansleep version of gpiod_set_value()  If we use GPIO reset from I2C port expander, we must use *_cansleep() variant of GPIO functions.

This issue is triggered when an EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE ioctl is set to require synchronous updates because the file descriptor is opened with O_SYNC. This can lead to the jbd2_journal_stop() function calling jbd2_might_wait_for_commit(), potentially causing a deadlock if the EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE call races with a write(2) system call.  This problem only arises when CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is enabled. In this case, the jbd2_might_wait_for_commit macro locks jbd2_handle in the jbd2_journal_stop function while i_data_sem is locked. This triggers lockdep because the jbd2_journal_start function might also lock the same jbd2_handle simultaneously.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with syzkaller.

If the process is killed by user(See signal handling in dax_iomap_iter()), the copied data will be returned and added on inode size, which means that the length of written extents may exceed the inode size, then fsck will fail. An example is given as:  dd if=/dev/urandom of=file bs=4M count=1  dax_iomap_rw   iomap_iter // round 1    ext4_iomap_begin     ext4_iomap_alloc // allocate 0~2M extents(written flag)   dax_iomap_iter // copy 2M data   iomap_iter // round 2    iomap_iter_advance     iter-&gt;pos += iter-&gt;processed // iter-&gt;pos = 2M    ext4_iomap_begin     ext4_iomap_alloc // allocate 2~4M extents(written flag)   dax_iomap_iter    fatal_signal_pending   done = iter-&gt;pos - iocb-&gt;ki_pos // done = 2M  ext4_handle_inode_extension   ext4_update_inode_size // inode size = 2M  fsck reports: Inode 13, i_size is 2097152, should be 4194304.

Otherwise, vmf-&gt;address not aligned to fault_size will be aligned to the next alignment, that can result in memory failure getting the wrong address.  It&apos;s a subtle situation that only can be observed in page_mapped_in_vma() after the page is page fault handled by dev_dax_huge_fault.  Generally, there is little chance to perform page_mapped_in_vma in dev-dax&apos;s page unless in specific error injection to the dax device to trigger an MCE - memory-failure.  In that case, page_mapped_in_vma() will be triggered to determine which task is accessing the failure address and kill that task in the end.   We used self-developed dax device (which is 2M aligned mapping) , to perform error injection to random address.  It turned out that error injected to non-2M-aligned address was causing endless MCE until panic. Because page_mapped_in_vma() kept resulting wrong address and the task accessing the failure address was never killed properly:   [ 3783.719419] Memory failure: 0x200c9742: recovery action for dax page:  Recovered [ 3784.049006] mce: Uncorrected hardware memory error in user-access at  200c9742380 [ 3784.049190] Memory failure: 0x200c9742: recovery action for dax page:  Recovered [ 3784.448042] mce: Uncorrected hardware memory error in user-access at  200c9742380 [ 3784.448186] Memory failure: 0x200c9742: recovery action for dax page:  Recovered [ 3784.792026] mce: Uncorrected hardware memory error in user-access at  200c9742380 [ 3784.792179] Memory failure: 0x200c9742: recovery action for dax page:  Recovered [ 3785.162502] mce: Uncorrected hardware memory error in user-access at  200c9742380 [ 3785.162633] Memory failure: 0x200c9742: recovery action for dax page:  Recovered [ 3785.461116] mce: Uncorrected hardware memory error in user-access at  200c9742380 [ 3785.461247] Memory failure: 0x200c9742: recovery action for dax page:  Recovered [ 3785.764730] mce: Uncorrected hardware memory error in user-access at  200c9742380 [ 3785.764859] Memory failure: 0x200c9742: recovery action for dax page:  Recovered [ 3786.042128] mce: Uncorrected hardware memory error in user-access at  200c9742380 [ 3786.042259] Memory failure: 0x200c9742: recovery action for dax page:  Recovered [ 3786.464293] mce: Uncorrected hardware memory error in user-access at  200c9742380 [ 3786.464423] Memory failure: 0x200c9742: recovery action for dax page:  Recovered [ 3786.818090] mce: Uncorrected hardware memory error in user-access at  200c9742380 [ 3786.818217] Memory failure: 0x200c9742: recovery action for dax page:  Recovered [ 3787.085297] mce: Uncorrected hardware memory error in user-access at  200c9742380 [ 3787.085424] Memory failure: 0x200c9742: recovery action for dax page:  Recovered  It took us several weeks to pinpoint this problem,  but we eventually used bpftrace to trace the page fault and mce address and successfully identified the issue.

The leak occurs when multiple threads attempt to modify the mac_filter_hash simultaneously, leading to inconsistent state and potential memory leaks.  To fix this, we now wrap the calls to i40e_del_mac_filter() and zeroing vf-&gt;default_lan_addr.addr with spin_lock/unlock_bh(&amp;vsi-&gt;mac_filter_hash_lock), ensuring atomic operations and preventing concurrent access.  Additionally, we add lockdep_assert_held(&amp;vsi-&gt;mac_filter_hash_lock) in i40e_add_mac_filter() to help catch similar issues in the future.  Reproduction steps: 1. Spawn VFs and configure port vlan on them. 2. Trigger concurrent macvlan operations (e.g., adding and deleting  portvlan and/or mac filters). 3. Observe the potential memory leak and inconsistent state in the  mac_filter_hash.  This synchronization ensures the integrity of the mac_filter_hash and prevents the described leak.(CVE-2024-50041)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smb: client: fix UAF in async decryption  Doing an async decryption (large read) crashes with a slab-use-after-free way down in the crypto API.

It added one to uart_shutdown(), so the commit assumes, uport can be NULL in there. But right after that protection, there is an unprotected &quot;uart_port_dtr_rts(uport, false);&quot; call. That is invoked only if HUPCL is set, so I assume that is the reason why we do not see lots of these reports.  Or it cannot be NULL at this point at all for some reason :P.  Until the above is investigated, stay on the safe side and move this dereference to the if too.  I got this inconsistency from Coverity under CID 1585130.

If we remove the module which will call switchtec_ntb_remove to make cleanup, it will free sndev through kfree(sndev), while the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:  CPU0                                 CPU1                          | check_link_status_work switchtec_ntb_remove    | kfree(sndev);           |                         | if (sndev-&gt;link_force_down)                         | // use sndev  Fix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with the cleanup in switchtec_ntb_remove.(CVE-2024-50059)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring: check if we need to reschedule during overflow flush  In terms of normal application usage, this list will always be empty. And if an application does overflow a bit, it&apos;ll have a few entries. However, nothing obviously prevents syzbot from running a test case that generates a ton of overflow entries, and then flushing them can take quite a while.  Check for needing to reschedule while flushing, and drop our locks and do so if necessary. There&apos;s no state to maintain here as overflows always prune from head-of-list, hence it&apos;s fine to drop and reacquire the locks at the end of the loop.(CVE-2024-50060)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Prevent tail call between progs attached to different hooks  bpf progs can be attached to kernel functions, and the attached functions can take different parameters or return different return values. If prog attached to one kernel function tail calls prog attached to another kernel function, the ctx access or return value verification could be bypassed.  For example, if prog1 is attached to func1 which takes only 1 parameter and prog2 is attached to func2 which takes two parameters. Since verifier assumes the bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed based on func2&apos;s prototype, verifier allows prog2 to access the second parameter from the bpf ctx passed to it. The problem is that verifier does not prevent prog1 from passing its bpf ctx to prog2 via tail call. In this case, the bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed from func1 instead of func2, that is, the assumption for ctx access verification is bypassed.  Another example, if BPF LSM prog1 is attached to hook file_alloc_security, and BPF LSM prog2 is attached to hook bpf_lsm_audit_rule_known. Verifier knows the return value rules for these two hooks, e.g. it is legal for bpf_lsm_audit_rule_known to return positive number 1, and it is illegal for file_alloc_security to return positive number. So verifier allows prog2 to return positive number 1, but does not allow prog1 to return positive number. The problem is that verifier does not prevent prog1 from calling prog2 via tail call. In this case, prog2&apos;s return value 1 will be used as the return value for prog1&apos;s hook file_alloc_security. That is, the return value rule is bypassed.  This patch adds restriction for tail call to prevent such bypasses.(CVE-2024-50063)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  zram: free secondary algorithms names  We need to kfree() secondary algorithms names when reset zram device that had multi-streams, otherwise we leak memory.  [senozhatsky@chromium.org: kfree(NULL) is legal]   Link: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20240917013021.868769-1-senozhatsky@chromium.org(CVE-2024-50064)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/mremap: fix move_normal_pmd/retract_page_tables race  In mremap(), move_page_tables() looks at the type of the PMD entry and the specified address range to figure out by which method the next chunk of page table entries should be moved.  At that point, the mmap_lock is held in write mode, but no rmap locks are held yet.  For PMD entries that point to page tables and are fully covered by the source address range, move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...) is called, which first takes rmap locks, then does move_normal_pmd().  move_normal_pmd() takes the necessary page table locks at source and destination, then moves an entire page table from the source to the destination.  The problem is: The rmap locks, which protect against concurrent page table removal by retract_page_tables() in the THP code, are only taken after the PMD entry has been read and it has been decided how to move it.  So we can race as follows (with two processes that have mappings of the same tmpfs file that is stored on a tmpfs mount with huge=advise); note that process A accesses page tables through the MM while process B does it through the file rmap:  process A                      process B =========                      ========= mremap   mremap_to     move_vma       move_page_tables         get_old_pmd         alloc_new_pmd                       *** PREEMPT ***                                madvise(MADV_COLLAPSE)                                  do_madvise                                    madvise_walk_vmas                                      madvise_vma_behavior                                        madvise_collapse                                          hpage_collapse_scan_file                                            collapse_file                                              retract_page_tables                                                i_mmap_lock_read(mapping)                                                pmdp_collapse_flush                                                i_mmap_unlock_read(mapping)         move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...)           take_rmap_locks           move_normal_pmd           drop_rmap_locks  When this happens, move_normal_pmd() can end up creating bogus PMD entries in the line `pmd_populate(mm, new_pmd, pmd_pgtable(pmd))`.  The effect depends on arch-specific and machine-specific details; on x86, you can end up with physical page 0 mapped as a page table, which is likely exploitable for user-&gt;kernel privilege escalation.  Fix the race by letting process B recheck that the PMD still points to a page table after the rmap locks have been taken.  Otherwise, we bail and let the caller fall back to the PTE-level copying path, which will then bail immediately at the pmd_none() check.  Bug reachability: Reaching this bug requires that you can create shmem/file THP mappings - anonymous THP uses different code that doesn&apos;t zap stuff under rmap locks.  File THP is gated on an experimental config flag (CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS), so on normal distro kernels you need shmem THP to hit this bug.  As far as I know, getting shmem THP normally requires that you can mount your own tmpfs with the right mount flags, which would require creating your own user+mount namespace; though I don&apos;t know if some distros maybe enable shmem THP by default or something like that.  Bug impact: This issue can likely be used for user-&gt;kernel privilege escalation when it is reachable.(CVE-2024-50066)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  uprobe: avoid out-of-bounds memory access of fetching args  Uprobe needs to fetch args into a percpu buffer, and then copy to ring buffer to avoid non-atomic context problem.  Sometimes user-space strings, arrays can be very large, but the size of percpu buffer is only page size. And store_trace_args() won&apos;t check whether these data exceeds a single page or not, caused out-of-bounds memory access.  It could be reproduced by following steps: 1. build kernel with CONFIG_KASAN enabled 2. save follow program as test.c  ``` \\#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; \\#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; \\#include &lt;string.h&gt;  // If string length large than MAX_STRING_SIZE, the fetch_store_strlen() // will return 0, cause __get_data_size() return shorter size, and // store_trace_args() will not trigger out-of-bounds access. // So make string length less than 4096. \\#define STRLEN 4093  void generate_string(char *str, int n) {     int i;     for (i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)     {         char c = i % 26 + &apos;a&apos;;         str[i] = c;     }     str[n-1] = &apos;\\0&apos;; }  void print_string(char *str) {     printf(&quot;%s\\n&quot;, str); }  int main() {     char tmp[STRLEN];      generate_string(tmp, STRLEN);     print_string(tmp);      return 0; } ``` 3. compile program `gcc -o test test.c`  4. get the offset of `print_string()` ``` objdump -t test | grep -w print_string 0000000000401199 g     F .text  000000000000001b              print_string ```  5. configure uprobe with offset 0x1199 ``` off=0x1199  cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/ echo &quot;p /root/test:${off} arg1=+0(%di):ustring arg2=\\$comm arg3=+0(%di):ustring&quot;  &gt; uprobe_events echo 1 &gt; events/uprobes/enable echo 1 &gt; tracing_on ```  6. run `test`, and kasan will report error. ================================================================== BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in strncpy_from_user+0x1d6/0x1f0 Write of size 8 at addr ffff88812311c004 by task test/499CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 499 Comm: test Not tainted 6.12.0-rc3+ #18 Hardware name: Red Hat KVM, BIOS 1.16.0-4.al8 04/01/2014 Call Trace:  &lt;TASK&gt;  dump_stack_lvl+0x55/0x70  print_address_description.constprop.0+0x27/0x310  kasan_report+0x10f/0x120  ? strncpy_from_user+0x1d6/0x1f0  strncpy_from_user+0x1d6/0x1f0  ? rmqueue.constprop.0+0x70d/0x2ad0  process_fetch_insn+0xb26/0x1470  ? __pfx_process_fetch_insn+0x10/0x10  ? _raw_spin_lock+0x85/0xe0  ? __pfx__raw_spin_lock+0x10/0x10  ? __pte_offset_map+0x1f/0x2d0  ? unwind_next_frame+0xc5f/0x1f80  ? arch_stack_walk+0x68/0xf0  ? is_bpf_text_address+0x23/0x30  ? kernel_text_address.part.0+0xbb/0xd0  ? __kernel_text_address+0x66/0xb0  ? unwind_get_return_address+0x5e/0xa0  ? __pfx_stack_trace_consume_entry+0x10/0x10  ? arch_stack_walk+0xa2/0xf0  ? _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x8b/0xf0  ? __pfx__raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x10/0x10  ? depot_alloc_stack+0x4c/0x1f0  ? _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore+0xe/0x30  ? stack_depot_save_flags+0x35d/0x4f0  ? kasan_save_stack+0x34/0x50  ? kasan_save_stack+0x24/0x50  ? mutex_lock+0x91/0xe0  ? __pfx_mutex_lock+0x10/0x10  prepare_uprobe_buffer.part.0+0x2cd/0x500  uprobe_dispatcher+0x2c3/0x6a0  ? __pfx_uprobe_dispatcher+0x10/0x10  ? __kasan_slab_alloc+0x4d/0x90  handler_chain+0xdd/0x3e0  handle_swbp+0x26e/0x3d0  ? __pfx_handle_swbp+0x10/0x10  ? uprobe_pre_sstep_notifier+0x151/0x1b0  irqentry_exit_to_user_mode+0xe2/0x1b0  asm_exc_int3+0x39/0x40 RIP: 0033:0x401199 Code: 01 c2 0f b6 45 fb 88 02 83 45 fc 01 8b 45 fc 3b 45 e4 7c b7 8b 45 e4 48 98 48 8d 50 ff 48 8b 45 e8 48 01 d0 ce RSP: 002b:00007ffdf00576a8 EFLAGS: 00000206 RAX: 00007ffdf00576b0 RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX: 0000000000000ff2 RDX: 0000000000000ffc RSI: 0000000000000ffd RDI: 00007ffdf00576b0 RBP: 00007ffdf00586b0 R08: 00007feb2f9c0d20 R09: 00007feb2f9c0d20 R10: 0000000000000001 R11: 0000000000000202 R12: 0000000000401040 R13: 00007ffdf0058780 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: 0000000000000000  &lt;/TASK&gt;  This commit enforces the buffer&apos;s maxlen less than a page-size to avoid store_trace_args() out-of-memory access.(CVE-2024-50067)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pinctrl: stm32: check devm_kasprintf() returned value  devm_kasprintf() can return a NULL pointer on failure but this returned value is not checked.

This is because segment registers with an arbitrary user value can result in #GP when executing VERW. Intel SDM vol. 2C documents the following behavior for VERW instruction:    #GP(0) - If a memory operand effective address is outside the CS, DS, ES,     FS, or GS segment limit.  CLEAR_CPU_BUFFERS macro executes VERW instruction before returning to user space. Use %cs selector to reference VERW operand. This ensures VERW will not #GP for an arbitrary user %ds.

However, since snprintf() returns the would-be-printed size, not the actually output size, the length calculation can still go over the given limit.  Use scnprintf() instead of snprintf(), which returns the actually output letters, for addressing the potential out-of-bounds access properly.(CVE-2024-50074)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vt: prevent kernel-infoleak in con_font_get()  font.data may not initialize all memory spaces depending on the implementation of vc-&gt;vc_sw-&gt;con_font_get. This may cause info-leak, so to prevent this, it is safest to modify it to initialize the allocated memory space to 0, and it generally does not affect the overall performance of the system.(CVE-2024-50076)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tcp: fix mptcp DSS corruption due to large pmtu xmit  Syzkaller was able to trigger a DSS corruption:    TCP: request_sock_subflow_v4: Possible SYN flooding on port [::]:20002.

---truncated---(CVE-2024-50084)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: fix uninitialized pointer free on read_alloc_one_name() error  The function read_alloc_one_name() does not initialize the name field of the passed fscrypt_str struct if kmalloc fails to allocate the corresponding buffer.  Thus, it is not guaranteed that fscrypt_str.name is initialized when freeing it.  This is a follow-up to the linked patch that fixes the remaining instances of the bug introduced by commit e43eec81c516 (&quot;btrfs: use struct qstr instead of name and namelen pairs&quot;).(CVE-2024-50087)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: fix uninitialized pointer free in add_inode_ref()  The add_inode_ref() function does not initialize the &quot;name&quot; struct when it is declared.  If any of the following calls to &quot;read_one_inode() returns NULL,   dir = read_one_inode(root, parent_objectid);  if (!dir) {   ret = -ENOENT;   goto out;  }   inode = read_one_inode(root, inode_objectid);  if (!inode) {   ret = -EIO;   goto out;  }  then &quot;name.name&quot; would be freed on &quot;out&quot; before being initialized.  out:  ...  kfree(name.name);  This issue was
