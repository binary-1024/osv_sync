Between 30 December 2024 and 4 March 2025 Python JSON Logger was vulnerable to RCE through a missing dependency. This occurred because msgspec-python313-pre was deleted by the owner leaving the name open to being claimed by a third party. If the package was claimed, it would allow them RCE on any Python JSON Logger user who installed the development dependencies on Python 3.13 (e.g. pip install python-json-logger[dev]). This issue has been resolved with 3.3.0.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-pythonjsonlogger","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:20.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/python-pythonjsonlogger@0.1.11-2?arch=source&distro=focal"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.1.11-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"python3-pythonjsonlogger","binary_version":"0.1.11-2"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-27607.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-pythonjsonlogger","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:22.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/python-pythonjsonlogger@2.0.1-2?arch=source&distro=jammy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.1-1","2.0.1-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"python3-pythonjsonlogger","binary_version":"2.0.1-2"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-27607.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-pythonjsonlogger","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/python-pythonjsonlogger@2.0.1-4?arch=source&distro=noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.1-3","2.0.1-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"python3-pythonjsonlogger","binary_version":"2.0.1-4"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-27607.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-pythonjsonlogger","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.10","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/python-pythonjsonlogger@3.3.0-1?arch=source&distro=questing"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.2.1-1","3.3.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"python3-pythonjsonlogger","binary_version":"3.3.0-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-27607.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-27607"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-27607"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/nhairs/python-json-logger/commit/2548e3a2e3cedf6bef3ee7c60c55b7c02d1af11a"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/nhairs/python-json-logger/commit/e7761e56edb980cfab0165e32469d5fd017a5d72"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/nhairs/python-json-logger/security/advisories/GHSA-wmxh-pxcx-9w24"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
