  "details": "Updated pdns-recursor packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nAn issue in the DNS protocol has been found that allow malicious parties\nto use recursive DNS services to attack third party authoritative name\nservers. The attack uses a crafted reply by an authoritative name server\nto amplify the resulting traffic between the recursive and other\nauthoritative name servers. Both types of service can suffer degraded\nperformance as an effect (CVE-2020-10995).\n\nAn issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor 4.1.0 through 4.3.0 where\nrecords in the answer section of a NXDOMAIN response lacking an SOA were\nnot properly validated in SyncRes::processAnswer. This would allow an\nattacker in position of man-in-the-middle to send a NXDOMAIN answer for\na name that does exist, bypassing DNSSEC validation (CVE-2020-12244).\n",
