Exposing the EC2_ACCESS_KEY via http or tools that allow man-in-the-middle over https could allow an attacker to easily obtain the EC2_SECRET_KEY. An attacker could also presumably brute force values for EC2_ACCESS_KEY.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2011-4076"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/868360"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2011-4076"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4076"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/10/25/4"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
