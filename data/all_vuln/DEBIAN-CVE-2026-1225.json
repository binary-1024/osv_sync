The instantiation of a potentially malicious Java class requires that said class is present on the user's class-path. In addition, the attacker must  have write access to a  configuration file. However, after successful instantiation, the instance is very likely to be discarded with no further ado.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"logback","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/logback?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:1.2.10-1","1:1.2.11-1","1:1.2.11-2","1:1.2.11-3","1:1.2.11-4","1:1.2.11-5","1:1.2.11-6","1:1.2.3-6","1:1.2.7-1","1:1.2.8-1","1:1.2.9-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-1225.json"}},{"package":{"name":"logback","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/logback?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:1.2.11-3","1:1.2.11-4","1:1.2.11-5","1:1.2.11-6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-1225.json"}},{"package":{"name":"logback","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/logback?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:1.2.11-6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-1225.json"}},{"package":{"name":"logback","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/logback?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:1.2.11-6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-1225.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2026-1225"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:P/PR:H/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:L/SI:L/SA:L/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:N/AU:N/R:X/V:X/RE:M/U:Green"}]}
