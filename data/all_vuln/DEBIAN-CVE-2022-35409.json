In some configurations, an unauthenticated attacker can send an invalid ClientHello message to a DTLS server that causes a heap-based buffer over-read of up to 255 bytes. This can cause a server crash or possibly information disclosure based on error responses. Affected configurations have MBEDTLS_SSL_DTLS_CLIENT_PORT_REUSE enabled and MBEDTLS_SSL_IN_CONTENT_LEN less than a threshold that depends on the configuration: 258 bytes if using mbedtls_ssl_cookie_check, and possibly up to 571 bytes with a custom cookie check function.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.16.11-0.1","2.16.11-0.2","2.16.11-0.3","2.16.9-0.1","2.16.9-0.1+deb11u1","2.16.9-0.1+deb11u2","2.16.9-0.1+deb11u3","2.28.0-0.1","2.28.0-0.2","2.28.0-0.3","2.28.0-1","2.28.0-2","2.28.1-1","2.28.2-1","2.28.3-1","2.28.4-1","2.28.5-1","2.28.6-1","2.28.7-1","2.28.7-1.1","2.28.7-1.1~exp1","2.28.8-1","3.6.0-1","3.6.0-2","3.6.0-3","3.6.2-1","3.6.2-2","3.6.2-3","3.6.3-1","3.6.4-1","3.6.4-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-35409.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.28.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-35409.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.28.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-35409.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.28.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-35409.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-35409"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"}]}
