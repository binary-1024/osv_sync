  "details": "An issue was discovered in Poppler 0.71.0. There is a memory leak in\nGfxColorSpace::setDisplayProfile in GfxState.cc, as demonstrated by\npdftocairo. (CVE-2018-18897)\n\nXRef::getEntry in XRef.cc in Poppler 0.72.0 mishandles unallocated XRef\nentries, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL\npointer dereference) via a crafted PDF document, when XRefEntry::setFlag\nin XRef.h is called from Parser::makeStream in Parser.cc. (CVE-2018-20481)\n\nA reachable Object::getString assertion in Poppler 0.72.0 allows attackers\nto cause a denial of service due to construction of invalid rich media\nannotation assets in the AnnotRichMedia class in Annot.c. (CVE-2018-20551)\n\nA reachable Object::dictLookup assertion in Poppler 0.72.0 allows attackers\nto cause a denial of service due to the lack of a check for the dict data\ntype, as demonstrated by use of the FileSpec class (in FileSpec.cc) in\npdfdetach. (CVE-2018-20650)\n\nIn Poppler 0.73.0, a heap-based buffer over-read (due to an integer\nsignedness error in the XRef::getEntry function in XRef.cc) allows remote\nattackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly\nhave unspecified other impact via a crafted PDF document, as demonstrated\nby pdftocairo.
