But I do not know the code\nperfectly, and I like to be safe.","references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dc1db0060c02d119fd4196924eff2d1129e9a442"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ebbbc5fea3f648175df1aa3f127c78eb0252cc2a"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"}]}
