If any of these configuration files has an embedded `NULL` character as the first character in a new line, it can lead to attempting to read memory prior to the start of the given buffer which may result in a crash. This issue is fixed in c-ares 1.27.0. No known workarounds exist.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"c-ares","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/c-ares?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.17.1-1","1.17.1-1+deb11u1","1.17.1-1+deb11u2","1.17.1-1+deb11u3","1.17.1-1.1","1.17.2-1","1.18.0-1","1.18.1-1","1.18.1-1~bpo10+1","1.18.1-2","1.18.1-3","1.19.0-1","1.19.1-1","1.19.1-2","1.19.1-3","1.20.0-1","1.20.0-2","1.20.0-3","1.20.1-1","1.21.0-1","1.22.0-1","1.22.1-1","1.23.0-1","1.24.0-1","1.25.0-1","1.26.0-1","1.26.0-1.1~exp1","1.27.0-1","1.27.0-1.1","1.27.0-1.1~exp1","1.27.0-1.2","1.28.1-1","1.29.0-1","1.30.0-1","1.31.0-1","1.32.2-1","1.32.2-2","1.32.3-1","1.33.0-1","1.33.1-1","1.33.1-2","1.34.2-1","1.34.3-1","1.34.4-1","1.34.4-2","1.34.4-2.1","1.34.5-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-25629.json"}},{"package":{"name":"c-ares","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/c-ares?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.18.1-3","1.19.0-1","1.19.1-1","1.19.1-2","1.19.1-3","1.20.0-1","1.20.0-2","1.20.0-3","1.20.1-1","1.21.0-1","1.22.0-1","1.22.1-1","1.23.0-1","1.24.0-1","1.25.0-1","1.26.0-1","1.26.0-1.1~exp1","1.27.0-1","1.27.0-1.1","1.27.0-1.1~exp1","1.27.0-1.2","1.28.1-1","1.29.0-1","1.30.0-1","1.31.0-1","1.32.2-1","1.32.2-2","1.32.3-1","1.33.0-1","1.33.1-1","1.33.1-2","1.34.2-1","1.34.3-1","1.34.4-1","1.34.4-2","1.34.4-2.1","1.34.5-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-25629.json"}},{"package":{"name":"c-ares","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/c-ares?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.27.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-25629.json"}},{"package":{"name":"c-ares","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/c-ares?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.27.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-25629.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-25629"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
