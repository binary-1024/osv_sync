This issue occurs due to improper handling of memory after the freeing of a PDU object, leading to potential memory corruption or the possibility of executing arbitrary code. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because it only occurs when an application uses libcoap incorrectly.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libcoap","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libcoap@4.1.2-1?arch=source&distro=bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.1.2-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"libcoap-1-0","binary_version":"4.1.2-1"},{"binary_name":"libcoap-1-0-bin","binary_version":"4.1.2-1"},{"binary_name":"libcoap-1-0-dev","binary_version":"4.1.2-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-50518.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-50518"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-50518"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/IreneTheITCrowd/blog/blob/main/libcoap-vulnerability.md"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/obgm/libcoap.git"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
