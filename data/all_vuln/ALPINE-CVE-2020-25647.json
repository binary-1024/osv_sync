During USB device initialization, descriptors are read with very little bounds checking and assumes the USB device is providing sane values. If properly exploited, an attacker could trigger memory corruption leading to arbitrary code execution allowing a bypass of the Secure Boot mechanism. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"grub","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/grub?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.06-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.02-r0","2.02-r1","2.02-r10","2.02-r11","2.02-r12","2.02-r13","2.02-r14","2.02-r15","2.02-r16","2.02-r17","2.02-r18","2.02-r19","2.02-r2","2.02-r20","2.02-r3","2.02-r4","2.02-r5","2.02-r6","2.02-r7","2.02-r8","2.02-r9","2.02_beta3-r0","2.02_beta3-r1","2.02_beta3-r2","2.02_beta3-r3","2.02_beta3-r4","2.02_beta3-r5","2.02_beta3-r6","2.02_beta3-r7","2.04-r0","2.04-r1","2.04-r2","2.04-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-25647.json"}},{"package":{"name":"grub","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/grub?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.06-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.02-r0","2.02-r1","2.02-r10","2.02-r11","2.02-r12","2.02-r13","2.02-r14","2.02-r15","2.02-r16","2.02-r17","2.02-r18","2.02-r19","2.02-r2","2.02-r20","2.02-r3","2.02-r4","2.02-r5","2.02-r6","2.02-r7","2.02-r8","2.02-r9","2.02_beta3-r0","2.02_beta3-r1","2.02_beta3-r2","2.02_beta3-r3","2.02_beta3-r4","2.02_beta3-r5","2.02_beta3-r6","2.02_beta3-r7","2.04-r0","2.04-r1","2.04-r2","2.04-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-25647.json"}},{"package":{"name":"grub","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/grub?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.06-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.02-r0","2.02-r1","2.02-r10","2.02-r11","2.02-r12","2.02-r13","2.02-r14","2.02-r15","2.02-r16","2.02-r17","2.02-r18","2.02-r19","2.02-r2","2.02-r20","2.02-r3","2.02-r4","2.02-r5","2.02-r6","2.02-r7","2.02-r8","2.02-r9","2.02_beta3-r0","2.02_beta3-r1","2.02_beta3-r2","2.02_beta3-r3","2.02_beta3-r4","2.02_beta3-r5","2.02_beta3-r6","2.02_beta3-r7","2.04-r0","2.04-r1","2.04-r2","2.04-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-25647.json"}},{"package":{"name":"grub","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/grub?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.06-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.02-r0","2.02-r1","2.02-r10","2.02-r11","2.02-r12","2.02-r13","2.02-r14","2.02-r15","2.02-r16","2.02-r17","2.02-r18","2.02-r19","2.02-r2","2.02-r20","2.02-r3","2.02-r4","2.02-r5","2.02-r6","2.02-r7","2.02-r8","2.02-r9","2.02_beta3-r0","2.02_beta3-r1","2.02_beta3-r2","2.02_beta3-r3","2.02_beta3-r4","2.02_beta3-r5","2.02_beta3-r6","2.02_beta3-r7","2.04-r0","2.04-r1","2.04-r2","2.04-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-25647.json"}},{"package":{"name":"grub","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/grub?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.06-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.02-r0","2.02-r1","2.02-r10","2.02-r11","2.02-r12","2.02-r13","2.02-r14","2.02-r15","2.02-r16","2.02-r17","2.02-r18","2.02-r19","2.02-r2","2.02-r20","2.02-r3","2.02-r4","2.02-r5","2.02-r6","2.02-r7","2.02-r8","2.02-r9","2.02_beta3-r0","2.02_beta3-r1","2.02_beta3-r2","2.02_beta3-r3","2.02_beta3-r4","2.02_beta3-r5","2.02_beta3-r6","2.02_beta3-r7","2.04-r0","2.04-r1","2.04-r2","2.04-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-25647.json"}},{"package":{"name":"grub","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/grub?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.06-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.02-r0","2.02-r1","2.02-r10","2.02-r11","2.02-r12","2.02-r13","2.02-r14","2.02-r15","2.02-r16","2.02-r17","2.02-r18","2.02-r19","2.02-r2","2.02-r20","2.02-r3","2.02-r4","2.02-r5","2.02-r6","2.02-r7","2.02-r8","2.02-r9","2.02_beta3-r0","2.02_beta3-r1","2.02_beta3-r2","2.02_beta3-r3","2.02_beta3-r4","2.02_beta3-r5","2.02_beta3-r6","2.02_beta3-r7","2.04-r0","2.04-r1","2.04-r2","2.04-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-25647.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2020-25647"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
