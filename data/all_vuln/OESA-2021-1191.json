The issue occurs in loopback mode of a NIC wherein reentrant DMA checks get bypassed. A guest user/process may use this flaw to consume CPU cycles or crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.(CVE-2021-3416)\r\n\r\nThe patch for CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2020-25085 was found to be ineffective, thus making QEMU vulnerable to the out-of-bounds read/write access issues previously found in the SDHCI controller emulation code. This flaw allows a malicious privileged guest to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution. QEMU up to (including) 5.2.0 is affected by this.(CVE-2021-3409)\r\n\r\nA use-after-free flaw was found in the MegaRAID emulator of QEMU. This issue occurs while processing SCSI I/O requests in the case of an error mptsas_free_request() that does not dequeue the request object &apos;req&apos; from a pending requests queue. This flaw allows a privileged guest user to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service. Versions between 2.10.0 and 5.2.0 are potentially affected.(CVE-2021-3392)\r\n\r\nQEMU 5.0.0 has a heap-based Buffer Overflow in flatview_read_continue in exec.c because hw/sd/sdhci.c mishandles a write operation in the SDHC_BLKSIZE case.(CVE-2020-25085)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"qemu","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/qemu&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.1.0-44.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["qemu-4.1.0-44.oe1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-img-4.1.0-44.oe1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-debugsource-4.1.0-44.oe1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-debuginfo-4.1.0-44.oe1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-block-iscsi-4.1.0-44.oe1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-guest-agent-4.1.0-44.oe1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-block-rbd-4.1.0-44.oe1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-block-ssh-4.1.0-44.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["qemu-help-4.1.0-44.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["qemu-4.1.0-44.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["qemu-img-4.1.0-44.oe1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-block-ssh-4.1.0-44.oe1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-guest-agent-4.1.0-44.oe1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-debuginfo-4.1.0-44.oe1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-block-rbd-4.1.0-44.oe1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-seabios-4.1.0-44.oe1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-block-iscsi-4.1.0-44.oe1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-4.1.0-44.oe1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-debugsource-4.1.0-44.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1191.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1191"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3416"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3409"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3392"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25085"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
