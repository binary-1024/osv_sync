{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-40320","published":"2025-12-08T01:16:04.670Z","modified":"2026-01-10T14:04:44.786970Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-40320"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smb: client: fix potential cfid UAF in smb2_query_info_compound  When smb2_query_info_compound() retries, a previously allocated cfid may have been freed in the first attempt. Because cfid wasn't reset on replay, later cleanup could act on a stale pointer, leading to a potential use-after-free.  Reinitialize cfid to NULL under the replay label.  Example trace (trimmed):  refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.
