This may result in nonintended users being granted an inherited capability set, potentially leading to security risks. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to achieve local privilege escalation on systems where /etc/security/capability.conf is used to configure user inherited privileges by constructing specific usernames.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libcap2","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libcap2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:2.44-1+deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["1:2.44-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-1390.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libcap2","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libcap2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:2.66-4+deb12u1"}]}],"versions":["1:2.66-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-1390.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libcap2","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libcap2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:2.73-4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-1390.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libcap2","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libcap2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:2.73-4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-1390.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-1390"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N"}]}
