It includes support to read, modify and write XML and HTML files. There is DTDs support this includes parsing and validation even with complex DtDs, either at parse time or later once the document has been modified. The output can be a simple SAX stream or and in-memory DOM like representations. In this case one can use the built-in XPath and XPointer implementation to select sub nodes or ranges. A flexible Input/Output mechanism is available, with existing HTTP and FTP modules and combined to an URI library.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA vulnerability found in libxml2 in versions before 2.9.11 shows that it did not propagate errors while parsing XML mixed content, causing a NULL dereference. If an untrusted XML document was parsed in recovery mode and post-validated, the flaw could be used to crash the application. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-3537)\r\n\r\nThere&apos;s a flaw in libxml2 in versions before 2.9.11. An attacker who is able to submit a crafted file to be processed by an application linked with libxml2 could trigger a use-after-free. The greatest impact from this flaw is to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.(CVE-2021-3518)\r\n\r\nThere is a flaw in the xml entity encoding functionality of libxml2 in versions before 2.9.11. An attacker who is able to supply a crafted file to be processed by an application linked with the affected functionality of libxml2 could trigger an out-of-bounds read. The most likely impact of this flaw is to application availability, with some potential impact to confidentiality and integrity if an attacker is able to use memory information to further exploit the application.(CVE-2021-3517)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libxml2","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/libxml2&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.10-16.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libxml2-debugsource-2.9.10-16.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libxml2-debuginfo-2.9.10-16.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libxml2-devel-2.9.10-16.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python2-libxml2-2.9.10-16.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-libxml2-2.9.10-16.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libxml2-2.9.10-16.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["libxml2-help-2.9.10-16.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["libxml2-2.9.10-16.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libxml2-2.9.10-16.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-libxml2-2.9.10-16.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libxml2-debugsource-2.9.10-16.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python2-libxml2-2.9.10-16.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libxml2-debuginfo-2.9.10-16.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libxml2-devel-2.9.10-16.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1202.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1202"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3537"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3518"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3517"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
