When abandoning a buffer, Vim may ask the user what to do with the modified buffer. If the user wants the changed buffer to be saved, Vim may create a new Untitled file, if the buffer did not have a name yet. However, when setting the buffer name to Unnamed, Vim will falsely free a pointer twice, leading to a double-free and possibly later to a heap-use-after-free, which can lead to a crash. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0648.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"vim","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/vim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2:8.2.2434-3","2:8.2.2434-3+deb11u1","2:8.2.2434-3+deb11u2","2:8.2.2434-3+deb11u3","2:8.2.3455-1","2:8.2.3455-2","2:8.2.3565-1","2:8.2.3995-1","2:8.2.4659-1","2:8.2.4793-1","2:9.0.0135-1","2:9.0.0229-1","2:9.0.0242-1","2:9.0.0626-1","2:9.0.0813-1","2:9.0.1000-1","2:9.0.1000-2","2:9.0.1000-3","2:9.0.1000-4","2:9.0.1378-1","2:9.0.1378-2","2:9.0.1658-1","2:9.0.1672-1","2:9.0.1894-1","2:9.0.2018-1","2:9.0.2087-1","2:9.0.2103-1","2:9.0.2116-1","2:9.0.2189-1","2:9.1.0-1","2:9.1.0016-1","2:9.1.0199-1","2:9.1.0374-1","2:9.1.0377-1","2:9.1.0496-1","2:9.1.0698-1","2:9.1.0709-1","2:9.1.0709-2","2:9.1.0777-1","2:9.1.0861-1","2:9.1.0967-1","2:9.1.0967-2","2:9.1.1113-1","2:9.1.1230-1","2:9.1.1230-2","2:9.1.1385-1","2:9.1.1766-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-41965.json"}},{"package":{"name":"vim","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/vim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2:9.0.1378-2","2:9.0.1378-2+deb12u1","2:9.0.1378-2+deb12u2","2:9.0.1658-1","2:9.0.1672-1","2:9.0.1894-1","2:9.0.2018-1","2:9.0.2087-1","2:9.0.2103-1","2:9.0.2116-1","2:9.0.2189-1","2:9.1.0-1","2:9.1.0016-1","2:9.1.0199-1","2:9.1.0374-1","2:9.1.0377-1","2:9.1.0496-1","2:9.1.0698-1","2:9.1.0709-1","2:9.1.0709-2","2:9.1.0777-1","2:9.1.0861-1","2:9.1.0967-1","2:9.1.0967-2","2:9.1.1113-1","2:9.1.1230-1","2:9.1.1230-2","2:9.1.1385-1","2:9.1.1766-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-41965.json"}},{"package":{"name":"vim","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/vim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2:9.1.0698-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-41965.json"}},{"package":{"name":"vim","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/vim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2:9.1.0698-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-41965.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-41965"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
