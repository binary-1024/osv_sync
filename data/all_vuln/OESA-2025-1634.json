This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 139, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.24, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.11, Thunderbird &lt; 139, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.11.(CVE-2025-5263)\n\nDue to insufficient escaping of the newline character in the \u201cCopy as cURL\u201d feature, an attacker could trick a user into using this command, potentially leading to local code execution on the user&apos;s system. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 139, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.24, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.11, Thunderbird &lt; 139, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.11.(CVE-2025-5264)\n\nScript elements loading cross-origin resources generated load and error events which leaked information enabling XS-Leaks attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 139, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.11, Thunderbird &lt; 139, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.11.(CVE-2025-5266)\n\nA clickjacking vulnerability could have been used to trick a user into leaking saved payment card details to a malicious page. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 139, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.11, Thunderbird &lt; 139, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.11.(CVE-2025-5267)\n\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 138, Thunderbird 138, Firefox ESR 128.10, and Thunderbird 128.10. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 139, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.11, Thunderbird &lt; 139, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.11.(CVE-2025-5268)\n\nMemory safety bug present in Firefox ESR 128.10, and Thunderbird 128.10. This bug showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort this could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR &lt; 128.11 and Thunderbird &lt; 128.11.(CVE-2025-5269)",
