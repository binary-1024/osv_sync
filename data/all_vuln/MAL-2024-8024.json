It has a limited risk.\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (1551be7c93a9149bcaf0349330ef723214923bd2e4eba65930b725144335f8e9)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'artifact-lab-3-package-b55680cd' @ 0.1.1 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package-b55680cd","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-b55680cd"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.1.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-b55680cd/MAL-2024-8024.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package-b55680cd"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-08-18T20:33:53.363839377Z","modified_time":"2024-08-18T20:06:04Z","sha256":"1551be7c93a9149bcaf0349330ef723214923bd2e4eba65930b725144335f8e9","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["0.1.1"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-b55680cd","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.931147452Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"e87f0edb82a994fd382dfba47083df3b7666f11ae2254e88ce414103d9dd0293","source":"kam193"}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
