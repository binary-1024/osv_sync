  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nregulator: max20086: fix invalid memory access\n\nmax20086_parse_regulators_dt() calls of_regulator_match() using an\narray of struct of_regulator_match allocated on the stack for the\nmatches argument.\n\nof_regulator_match() calls devm_of_regulator_put_matches(), which calls\ndevres_alloc() to allocate a struct devm_of_regulator_matches which will\nbe de-allocated using devm_of_regulator_put_matches().\n\nstruct devm_of_regulator_matches is populated with the stack allocated\nmatches array.\n\nIf the device fails to probe, devm_of_regulator_put_matches() will be\ncalled and will try to call of_node_put() on that stack pointer,\ngenerating the following dmesg entries:\n\nmax20086 6-0028: Failed to read DEVICE_ID reg: -121\nkobject: '\\xc0$\\xa5\\x03' (000000002cebcb7a): is not initialized, yet\nkobject_put() is being called.\n\nFollowed by a stack trace matching the call flow described above.\n\nSwitch to allocating the matches array using devm_kcalloc() to\navoid accessing the stack pointer long after it's out of scope.\n\nThis also has the advantage of allowing multiple max20086 to probe\nwithout overriding the data stored inside the global of_regulator_match.",
