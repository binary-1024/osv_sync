  "details": "The Realm implementations did not process the supplied password if the\nsupplied user name did not exist. This made a timing attack possible to\ndetermine valid user names. Note that the default configuration includes\nthe LockOutRealm which makes exploitation of this vulnerability harder\n(CVE-2016-0762).\n\nA malicious web application was able to bypass a configured\nSecurityManager via a Tomcat utility method that was accessible to web\napplications (CVE-2016-5018).\n\nIt was discovered that the Tomcat packages installed configuration file\n/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf writeable to the tomcat group. A member\nof the group or a malicious web application deployed on Tomcat could use\nthis flaw to escalate their privileges (CVE-2016-5425).\n\nIt was discovered that the Tomcat packages installed certain\nconfiguration files read by the Tomcat initialization script as\nwriteable to the tomcat group. A member of the group or a malicious web\napplication deployed on Tomcat could use this flaw to escalate their\nprivileges (CVE-2016-6325).\n\nWhen a SecurityManager is configured, a web application's ability to\nread system properties should be controlled by the SecurityManager.\nTomcat's system property replacement feature for configuration files\ncould be used by a malicious web application to bypass the\nSecurityManager and read system properties that should not be visible\n(CVE-2016-6794).\n\nA malicious web application was able to bypass a configured\nSecurityManager via manipulation of the configuration parameters for the\nJSP Servlet (CVE-2016-6796).\n\nThe ResourceLinkFactory did not limit web application access to global\nJNDI resources to those resources explicitly linked to the web\napplication. Therefore, it was possible for a web application to access\nany global JNDI resource whether an explicit ResourceLink had been\nconfigured or not (CVE-2016-6797).\n",
