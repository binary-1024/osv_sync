When provided with a URL containing many @ characters in the authority component, the authority regular expression exhibits catastrophic backtracking, causing a denial of service if a URL were passed as a parameter or redirected to via an HTTP redirect.(CVE-2021-33503)\r\n\r\nLib/ipaddress.py in Python through 3.8.3 improperly computes hash values in the IPv4Interface and IPv6Interface classes, which might allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service if an application is affected by the performance of a dictionary containing IPv4Interface or IPv6Interface objects, and this attacker can cause many dictionary entries to be created. This is fixed in: v3.5.10, v3.5.10rc1; v3.6.12; v3.7.9; v3.8.4, v3.8.4rc1, v3.8.5, v3.8.6, v3.8.6rc1; v3.9.0, v3.9.0b4, v3.9.0b5, v3.9.0rc1, v3.9.0rc2.(CVE-2020-14422)",
