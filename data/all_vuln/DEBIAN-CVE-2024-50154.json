Martin KaFai Lau reported use-after-free [0] in reqsk_timer_handler().    \"\"\"   We are seeing a use-after-free from a bpf prog attached to   trace_tcp_retransmit_synack. The program passes the req->sk to the   bpf_sk_storage_get_tracing kernel helper which does check for null   before using it.   \"\"\"  The commit 83fccfc3940c (\"inet: fix potential deadlock in reqsk_queue_unlink()\") added timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink() not to call del_timer_sync() from reqsk_timer_handler(), but it introduced a small race window.  Before the timer is called, expire_timers() calls detach_timer(timer, true) to clear timer->entry.pprev and marks it as not pending.  If reqsk_queue_unlink() checks timer_pending() just after expire_timers() calls detach_timer(), TCP will miss del_timer_sync(); the reqsk timer will continue running and send multiple SYN+ACKs until it expires.  The reported UAF could happen if req->sk is close()d earlier than the timer expiration, which is 63s by default.  The scenario would be    1. inet_csk_complete_hashdance() calls inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop(),      but del_timer_sync() is missed    2. reqsk timer is executed and scheduled again    3. req->sk is accept()ed and reqsk_put() decrements rsk_refcnt, but      reqsk timer still has another one, and inet_csk_accept() does not      clear req->sk for non-TFO sockets    4. sk is close()d    5. reqsk timer is executed again, and BPF touches req->sk  Let's not use timer_pending() by passing the caller context to __inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop().  Note that reqsk timer is pinned, so the issue does not happen in most use cases.
