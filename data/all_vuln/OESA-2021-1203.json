The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests False` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.(CVE-2021-29509)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"rubygem-puma","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/rubygem-puma&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.12.6-2.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["rubygem-puma-3.12.6-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","rubygem-puma-debugsource-3.12.6-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","rubygem-puma-debuginfo-3.12.6-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["rubygem-puma-doc-3.12.6-2.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["rubygem-puma-3.12.6-2.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["rubygem-puma-debugsource-3.12.6-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","rubygem-puma-3.12.6-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","rubygem-puma-debuginfo-3.12.6-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1203.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1203"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29509"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
