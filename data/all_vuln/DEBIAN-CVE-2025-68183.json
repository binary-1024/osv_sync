{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68183","published":"2025-12-16T14:15:50.880Z","modified":"2026-01-10T14:07:48.690027Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-68183"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ima: don't clear IMA_DIGSIG flag when setting or removing non-IMA xattr  Currently when both IMA and EVM are in fix mode, the IMA signature will be reset to IMA hash if a program first stores IMA signature in security.ima and then writes/removes some other security xattr for the file.  For example, on Fedora, after booting the kernel with \"ima_appraise=fix evm=fix ima_policy=appraise_tcb\" and installing rpm-plugin-ima, installing/reinstalling a package will not make good reference IMA signature generated. Instead IMA hash is generated,      # getfattr -m - -d -e hex /usr/bin/bash     # file: usr/bin/bash     security.ima=0x0404...  This happens because when setting security.selinux, the IMA_DIGSIG flag that had been set early was cleared. As a result, IMA hash is generated when the file is closed.  Similarly, IMA signature can be cleared on file close after removing security xattr like security.evm or setting/removing ACL.  Prevent replacing the IMA file signature with a file hash, by preventing the IMA_DIGSIG flag from being reset.  Here's a minimal C reproducer which sets security.selinux as the last step which can also replaced by removing security.evm or setting ACL,      #include <stdio.h>     #include <sys/xattr.h>
