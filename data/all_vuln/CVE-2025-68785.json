The innermost\nOVS_NSH_KEY_ATTR_BASE/MD1/MD2 are OK'ed by the nla_for_each_nested()\ninside nsh_key_put_from_nlattr().  But nothing checks if the attribute\nin the middle is OK.  We don't even check that this attribute is the\nOVS_KEY_ATTR_NSH.  We just do a double unwrap with a pair of nla_data()\ncalls - first time directly while calling validate_push_nsh() and the\nsecond time as part of the nla_for_each_nested() macro, which isn't\nsafe, potentially causing invalid memory access if the size of this\nattribute is incorrect.  The failure may not be noticed during\nvalidation due to larger netlink buffer, but cause trouble later during\naction execution where the buffer is allocated exactly to the size:\n\n BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in nsh_hdr_from_nlattr+0x1dd/0x6a0 [openvswitch]\n Read of size 184 at addr ffff88816459a634 by task a.out/22624\n\n CPU: 8 UID: 0 PID: 22624 6.18.0-rc7+ #115 PREEMPT(voluntary)\n Call Trace:\n  <TASK>\n  dump_stack_lvl+0x51/0x70\n  print_address_description.constprop.0+0x2c/0x390\n  kasan_report+0xdd/0x110\n  kasan_check_range+0x35/0x1b0\n  __asan_memcpy+0x20/0x60\n  nsh_hdr_from_nlattr+0x1dd/0x6a0 [openvswitch]\n  push_nsh+0x82/0x120 [openvswitch]\n  do_execute_actions+0x1405/0x2840 [openvswitch]\n  ovs_execute_actions+0xd5/0x3b0 [openvswitch]\n  ovs_packet_cmd_execute+0x949/0xdb0 [openvswitch]\n  genl_family_rcv_msg_doit+0x1d6/0x2b0\n  genl_family_rcv_msg+0x336/0x580\n  genl_rcv_msg+0x9f/0x130\n  netlink_rcv_skb+0x11f/0x370\n  genl_rcv+0x24/0x40\n  netlink_unicast+0x73e/0xaa0\n  netlink_sendmsg+0x744/0xbf0\n  __sys_sendto+0x3d6/0x450\n  do_syscall_64+0x79/0x2c0\n  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n  </TASK>\n\nLet's add some checks that the attribute is properly sized and it's\nthe only one attribute inside the action.  Technically, there is no\nreal reason for OVS_KEY_ATTR_NSH to be there, as we know that we're\npushing an NSH header already, it just creates extra nesting, but\nthat's how uAPI works today.  So, keeping as it is.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"b2d0f5d5dc53532e6f07bc546a476a55ebdfe0f3"},{"fixed":"1b569db9c2f28b599e40050524aae5f7332bc294"},{"fixed":"10ffc558246f2c75619aedda0921906095e46702"},{"fixed":"2ecfc4433acdb149eafd7fb22d7fd4adf90b25e9"},{"fixed":"c999153bfb2d1d9b295b7010d920f2a7c6d7595f"},{"fixed":"5ace7ef87f059d68b5f50837ef3e8a1a4870c36e"}]}],"versions":["v4.14","v4.14-rc8","v4.15","v4.15-rc1","v4.15-rc2","v4.15-rc3","v4.15-rc4","v4.15-rc5","v4.15-rc6","v4.15-rc7","v4.15-rc8","v4.15-rc9","v4.16","v4.16-rc1","v4.16-rc2","v4.16-rc3","v4.16-rc4","v4.16-rc5","v4.16-rc6","v4.16-rc7","v4.17","v4.17-rc1","v4.17-rc2","v4.17-rc3","v4.17-rc4","v4.17-rc5","v4.17-rc6","v4.17-rc7","v4.18","v4.18-rc1","v4.18-rc2","v4.18-rc3","v4.18-rc4","v4.18-rc5","v4.18-rc6","v4.18-rc7","v4.18-rc8","v4.19","v4.19-rc1","v4.19-rc2","v4.19-rc3","v4.19-rc4","v4.19-rc5","v4.19-rc6","v4.19-rc7","v4.19-rc8","v4.20","v4.20-rc1","v4.20-rc2","v4.20-rc3","v4.20-rc4","v4.20-rc5","v4.20-rc6","v4.20-rc7","v5.0","v5.0-rc1","v5.0-rc2","v5.0-rc3","v5.0-rc4","v5.0-rc5","v5.0-rc6","v5.0-rc7","v5.0-rc8","v5.1","v5.1-rc1","v5.1-rc2","v5.1-rc3","v5.1-rc4","v5.1-rc5","v5.1-rc6","v5.1-rc7","v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.2","v5.2-rc1","v5.2-rc2","v5.2-rc3","v5.2-rc4","v5.2-rc5","v5.2-rc6","v5.2-rc7","v5.3","v5.3-rc1","v5.3-rc2","v5.3-rc3","v5.3-rc4","v5.3-rc5","v5.3-rc6","v5.3-rc7","v5.3-rc8","v5.4","v5.4-rc1","v5.4-rc2","v5.4-rc3","v5.4-rc4","v5.4-rc5","v5.4-rc6","v5.4-rc7","v5.4-rc8","v5.5","v5.5-rc1","v5.5-rc2","v5.5-rc3","v5.5-rc4","v5.5-rc5","v5.5-rc6","v5.5-rc7","v5.6","v5.6-rc1","v5.6-rc2","v5.6-rc3","v5.6-rc4","v5.6-rc5","v5.6-rc6","v5.6-rc7","v5.7","v5.7-rc1","v5.7-rc2","v5.7-rc3","v5.7-rc4","v5.7-rc5","v5.7-rc6","v5.7-rc7","v5.8","v5.8-rc1","v5.8-rc2","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc4","v5.8-rc5","v5.8-rc6","v5.8-rc7","v5.9","v5.9-rc1","v5.9-rc2","v5.9-rc3","v5.9-rc4","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.100","v6.1.101","v6.1.102","v6.1.103","v6.1.104","v6.1.105","v6.1.106","v6.1.107","v6.1.108","v6.1.109","v6.1.11","v6.1.110","v6.1.111","v6.1.112","v6.1.113","v6.1.114","v6.1.115","v6.1.116","v6.1.117","v6.1.118","v6.1.119","v6.1.12","v6.1.120","v6.1.121","v6.1.122","v6.1.123","v6.1.124","v6.1.125","v6.1.126","v6.1.127","v6.1.128","v6.1.129","v6.1.13","v6.1.130","v6.1.131","v6.1.132","v6.1.133","v6.1.134","v6.1.135","v6.1.136","v6.1.137","v6.1.138","v6.1.139","v6.1.14","v6.1.140","v6.1.141","v6.1.142","v6.1.143","v6.1.144","v6.1.145","v6.1.146","v6.1.147","v6.1.148","v6.1.149","v6.1.15","v6.1.150","v6.1.151","v6.1.152","v6.1.153","v6.1.154","v6.1.155","v6.1.156","v6.1.157","v6.1.158","v6.1.159","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.53","v6.1.54","v6.1.55","v6.1.56","v6.1.57","v6.1.58","v6.1.59","v6.1.6","v6.1.60","v6.1.61","v6.1.62","v6.1.63","v6.1.64","v6.1.65","v6.1.66","v6.1.67","v6.1.68","v6.1.69","v6.1.7","v6.1.70","v6.1.71","v6.1.72","v6.1.73","v6.1.74","v6.1.75","v6.1.76","v6.1.77","v6.1.78","v6.1.79","v6.1.8","v6.1.80","v6.1.81","v6.1.82","v6.1.83","v6.1.84","v6.1.85","v6.1.86","v6.1.87","v6.1.88","v6.1.89","v6.1.9","v6.1.90","v6.1.91","v6.1.92","v6.1.93","v6.1.94","v6.1.95","v6.1.96","v6.1.97","v6.1.98","v6.1.99","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-r
