Comparing ACPIID_LEN against a total string length doesn&apos;t\ntake into account the lengths of individual hid and uid buffers so the\ncheck is insufficient in some cases. For example if the length of hid\nstring is 4 and the length of the uid string is 260, the length of str\nwill be equal to ACPIID_LEN + 1 but uid string will overflow uid buffer\nwhich size is 256.\n\nThe same applies to the hid string with length 13 and uid string with\nlength 250.\n\nCheck the length of hid and uid strings separately to prevent\nbuffer overflow.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.(CVE-2025-37927)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/sev: Evict cache lines during SNP memory validation\n\nAn SNP cache coherency vulnerability requires a cache line eviction\nmitigation when validating memory after a page state change to private.\nThe specific mitigation is to touch the first and last byte of each 4K\npage that is being validated. There is no need to perform the mitigation\nwhen performing a page state change to shared and rescinding validation.\n\nCPUID bit Fn8000001F_EBX[31] defines the COHERENCY_SFW_NO CPUID bit\nthat, when set, indicates that the software mitigation for this\nvulnerability is not needed.\n\nImplement the mitigation and invoke it when validating memory (making it\nprivate) and the COHERENCY_SFW_NO bit is not set, indicating the SNP\nguest is vulnerable.(CVE-2025-38560)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni40e: remove read access to debugfs files\n\nThe &apos;command&apos; and &apos;netdev_ops&apos; debugfs files are a legacy debugging\ninterface supported by the i40e driver since its early days by commit\n02e9c290814c (&quot;i40e: debugfs interface&quot;).\n\nBoth of these debugfs files provide a read handler which is mostly useless,\nand which is implemented with questionable logic. They both use a static\n256 byte buffer which is initialized to the empty string. In the case of\nthe &apos;command&apos; file this buffer is literally never used and simply wastes\nspace. In the case of the &apos;netdev_ops&apos; file, the last command written is\nsaved here.\n\nOn read, the files contents are presented as the name of the device\nfollowed by a colon and then the contents of their respective static\nbuffer. For &apos;command&apos; this will always be &quot;&lt;device&gt;: &quot;. For &apos;netdev_ops&apos;,\nthis will be &quot;&lt;device&gt;: &lt;last command written&gt;&quot;. But note the buffer is\nshared between all devices operated by this module. At best, it is mostly\nmeaningless information, and at worse it could be accessed simultaneously\nas there doesn&apos;t appear to be any locking mechanism.\n\nWe have also recently received multiple reports for both read functions\nabout their use of snprintf and potential overflow that could result in\nreading arbitrary kernel memory. For the &apos;command&apos; file, this is definitely\nimpossible, since the static buffer is always zero and never written to.\nFor the &apos;netdev_ops&apos; file, it does appear to be possible, if the user\ncarefully crafts the command input, it will be copied into the buffer,\nwhich could be large enough to cause snprintf to truncate, which then\ncauses the copy_to_user to read beyond the length of the buffer allocated\nby kzalloc.\n\nA minimal fix would be to replace snprintf() with scnprintf() which would\ncap the return to the number of bytes written, preventing an overflow. A\nmore involved fix would be to drop the mostly useless static buffers,\nsaving 512 bytes and modifying the read functions to stop needing those as\ninput.\n\nInstead, lets just completely drop the read access to these files. These\nare debug interfaces exposed as part of debugfs, and I don&apos;t believe that\ndropping read access will break any script, as the provided output is\npretty useless. You can find the netdev name through other more standard\ninterfaces, and the &apos;netdev_ops&apos; interface can easily result in garbage if\nyou issue simultaneous writes to multiple devices at once.\n\nIn order to properly remove the i40e_dbg_netdev_ops_buf, we need to\nrefactor its write function to avoid using the static buffer. Instead, use\nthe same logic as the i40e_dbg_command_write, with an allocated buffer.\nUpdate the code to use this instead of the static buffer, and ensure we\nfree the buffer on exit. This fixes simultaneous writes to &apos;netdev_ops&apos; on\nmultiple devices, and allows us to remove the now unused static buffer\nalong with removing the read access.(CVE-2025-39901)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: smbdirect: verify remaining_data_length respects max_fragmented_recv_size\n\nThis is inspired by the check for data_offset + data_length.(CVE-2025-39942)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/ksm: fix flag-dropping behavior in ksm_madvise\n\nsyzkaller discovered the following crash: (kernel BUG)\n\n[   44.607039] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[   44.607422] kernel BUG at mm/userfaultfd.c:2067!\n[   44.608148] Oops: invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP DEBUG_PAGEALLOC KASAN NOPTI\n[   44.608814] CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 2475 Comm: reproducer Not tainted 6.16.0-rc6 #1 PREEMPT(none)\n[   44.609635] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.3-0-ga6ed6b701f0a-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\n[   44.610695] RIP: 0010:userfaultfd_release_all+0x3a8/0x460\n\n&lt;snip other registers, drop unreliable trace&gt;\n\n[   44.617726] Call Trace:\n[   44.617926]  &lt;TASK&gt;\n[   44.619284]  userfaultfd_release+0xef/0x1b0\n[   44.620976]  __fput+0x3f9/0xb60\n[   44.621240]  fput_close_sync+0x110/0x210\n[   44.622222]  __x64_sys_close+0x8f/0x120\n[   44.622530]  do_syscall_64+0x5b/0x2f0\n[   44.622840]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n[   44.623244] RIP: 0033:0x7f365bb3f227\n\nKernel panics because it detects UFFD inconsistency during\nuserfaultfd_release_all().

This promotion fills\nupper 32 bits with leading 0s, as we&apos;re doing unsigned conversion (and\neven for a signed conversion, this wouldn&apos;t help as the leading bit is 0).\n&amp; operation thus ends up AND-ing vm_flags with 0x0000&apos;0000&apos;7fff&apos;ffff\ninstead of intended 0xffff&apos;ffff&apos;7fff&apos;ffff and hence accidentally clears\nthe upper 32-bits of its value.\n\nFix it by changing `VM_MERGEABLE` constant to unsigned long, using the\nBIT() macro.\n\nNote: other VM_* flags are not affected: This only happens to the\nVM_MERGEABLE flag, as the other VM_* flags are all constants of type int\nand after ~ operation, they end up with leading 1 and are thus converted\nto unsigned long with leading 1s.\n\nNote 2:\nAfter commit 31defc3b01d9 (&quot;userfaultfd: remove
