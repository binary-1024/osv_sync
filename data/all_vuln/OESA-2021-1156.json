At its core is a fast, scalable,  transactional database engine with proven reliability and availability.  Berkeley DB comes three versions: Berkeley DB, Berkeley DB Java  Edition, and Berkeley DB XML.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nVulnerability in the Data Store component of Oracle Berkeley DB. Supported versions that are affected are Prior to 6.138, prior to 6.2.38 and prior to 18.1.32. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker having Local Logon privilege with logon to the infrastructure where Data Store executes to compromise Data Store. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Data Store. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.3 (Availability impacts).
