  "details": "A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the safe_asterisk script included with the Asterisk toolkit package. When Asterisk is started via this script (common in SysV init or FreePBX environments), it sources all .sh files located in /etc/asterisk/startup.d/ as root, without validating ownership or permissions.\n\n\nNon-root users with legitimate write access to /etc/asterisk can exploit this behaviour by placing malicious scripts in the startup.d directory, which will then execute with root privileges upon service restart.",
