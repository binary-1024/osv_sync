{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-22782","published":"2026-01-16T16:14:15.203Z","modified":"2026-01-28T05:51:50.599693Z","aliases":["GHSA-333v-68xh-8mmq"],"summary":"RustFS RPC signature verification logs shared secret","details":"RustFS is a distributed object storage system built in Rust. From >= 1.0.0-alpha.1 to 1.0.0-alpha.79, invalid RPC signatures cause the server to log the shared HMAC secret (and expected signature), which exposes the secret to log readers and enables forged RPC calls. In crates/ecstore/src/rpc/http_auth.rs, the invalid signature branch logs sensitive data. This log line includes secret and expected_signature, both derived from the shared HMAC key. Any invalidly signed request triggers this path. The function is reachable from RPC and admin request handlers. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.0-alpha.80.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rustfs/rustfs","events":[{"introduced":"6a5fbe7ef112c77cc285dcdacfffbee28a76e4a9"},{"fixed":"ed4329d50caefacb67838840eb7f694c11d9f038"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0-alpha.1","1.0.0-alpha.10","1.0.0-alpha.11","1.0.0-alpha.12","1.0.0-alpha.13","1.0.0-alpha.14","1.0.0-alpha.15","1.0.0-alpha.16","1.0.0-alpha.17","1.0.0-alpha.18","1.0.0-alpha.19","1.0.0-alpha.2","1.0.0-alpha.20","1.0.0-alpha.21","1.0.0-alpha.22","1.0.0-alpha.23","1.0.0-alpha.24","1.0.0-alpha.25","1.0.0-alpha.26","1.0.0-alpha.27","1.0.0-alpha.28","1.0.0-alpha.29","1.0.0-alpha.3","1.0.0-alpha.30","1.0.0-alpha.31","1.0.0-alpha.32","1.0.0-alpha.33","1.0.0-alpha.34","1.0.0-alpha.35","1.0.0-alpha.36","1.0.0-alpha.37","1.0.0-alpha.38","1.0.0-alpha.39","1.0.0-alpha.4","1.0.0-alpha.40","1.0.0-alpha.41","1.0.0-alpha.42","1.0.0-alpha.43","1.0.0-alpha.44","1.0.0-alpha.45","1.0.0-alpha.46","1.0.0-alpha.47","1.0.0-alpha.48","1.0.0-alpha.49","1.0.0-alpha.5","1.0.0-alpha.50","1.0.0-alpha.51","1.0.0-alpha.52","1.0.0-alpha.53","1.0.0-alpha.54","1.0.0-alpha.55","1.0.0-alpha.56","1.0.0-alpha.57","1.0.0-alpha.58","1.0.0-alpha.59","1.0.0-alpha.6","1.0.0-alpha.60","1.0.0-alpha.61","1.0.0-alpha.62","1.0.0-alpha.63","1.0.0-alpha.64","1.0.0-alpha.65","1.0.0-alpha.66","1.0.0-alpha.67","1.0.0-alpha.68","1.0.0-alpha.69","1.0.0-alpha.7","1.0.0-alpha.70","1.0.0-alpha.71","1.0.0-alpha.72","1.0.0-alpha.73","1.0.0-alpha.74","1.0.0-alpha.75","1.0.0-alpha.76","1.0.0-alpha.77","1.0.0-alpha.78","1.0.0-alpha.79","1.0.0-alpha.8","1.0.0-alpha.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22782.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22782.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rustfs/rustfs/blob/9e162b6e9ebb874cc1d06a7b33bc4a05786578aa/crates/ecstore/src/rpc/http_auth.rs#L115-L122"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/rustfs/rustfs/commit/6b2eebee1d07399ef02c0863bd515b4412a5a560"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/rustfs/rustfs/security/advisories/GHSA-333v-68xh-8mmq"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22782"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-532"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22782.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
