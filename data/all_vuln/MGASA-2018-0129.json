  "details": "This update provides nasm 2.13.03 and fixes the following security issues:\n\nIn Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0, there is a \"SEGV on unknown address\"\nthat will cause a remote denial of service attack, because asm/preproc.c\nmishandles macro calls that have the wrong number of arguments.\n\nIn Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0, there is a heap-based buffer overflow\nthat will cause a remote denial of service attack, related to a strcpy in\npaste_tokens in asm/preproc.c, a similar issue to CVE-2017-11111.\n\nIn Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0, there is a heap-based buffer over-read\nin the function detoken() in asm/preproc.c that will cause a remote denial\nof service attack.\n\nIn Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0, there is a use-after-free in the\npp_list_one_macro function in asm/preproc.c that will cause a remote denial\nof service attack, related to mishandling of line-syntax errors.\n\nIn Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0, there is a use-after-free in\ndo_directive in asm/preproc.c that will cause a remote denial of service\nattack.\n\nIn Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0, there is an illegal address access in\nis_mmacro() in asm/preproc.c that will cause a remote denial of service\nattack, because of a missing check for the relationship between minimum\nand maximum parameter counts.\n\nIn Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0, there is a use-after-free in\npp_getline in asm/preproc.c that will cause a remote denial of service\nattack.\n\nIn Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0, there is a use-after-free in\npp_verror in asm/preproc.c that will cause a remote denial of service\nattack.\n\nIn Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0, there is a heap-based buffer over-read\nthat will cause a remote denial of service attack, related to a while loop\nin paste_tokens in asm/preproc.c.\n\nIn Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0, there is an illegal address access in\nthe function find_cc() in asm/preproc.c that will cause a remote denial of\nservice attack, because pointers associated with skip_white_ calls are not\nvalidated.\n\nIn Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0, there is a use-after-free in\npp_list_one_macro in asm/preproc.c that will lead to a remote denial of\nservice attack, related to mishandling of operand-type errors.\n",
