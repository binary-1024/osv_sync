  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: fix memory ordering between normal and ordered work functions  Ordered work functions aren't guaranteed to be handled by the same thread which executed the normal work functions. The only way execution between normal/ordered functions is synchronized is via the WORK_DONE_BIT, unfortunately the used bitops don't guarantee any ordering whatsoever.  This manifested as seemingly inexplicable crashes on ARM64, where async_chunk::inode is seen as non-null in async_cow_submit which causes submit_compressed_extents to be called and crash occurs because async_chunk::inode suddenly became NULL. The call trace was similar to:      pc : submit_compressed_extents+0x38/0x3d0     lr : async_cow_submit+0x50/0xd0     sp : ffff800015d4bc20      <registers omitted for brevity>      Call trace:      submit_compressed_extents+0x38/0x3d0      async_cow_submit+0x50/0xd0      run_ordered_work+0xc8/0x280      btrfs_work_helper+0x98/0x250      process_one_work+0x1f0/0x4ac      worker_thread+0x188/0x504      kthread+0x110/0x114      ret_from_fork+0x10/0x18  Fix this by adding respective barrier calls which ensure that all accesses preceding setting of WORK_DONE_BIT are strictly ordered before setting the flag. At the same time add a read barrier after reading of WORK_DONE_BIT in run_ordered_work which ensures all subsequent loads would be strictly ordered after reading the bit. This in turn ensures are all accesses before WORK_DONE_BIT are going to be strictly ordered before any access that can occur in ordered_func.",
