  "details": "389-ds-base is an LDAPv3 compliant server which includes the LDAP server and command line utilities for server administration.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn access control bypass vulnerability found in 389-ds-base. That mishandling of the filter that would yield incorrect results, but as that has progressed, can be determined that it actually is an access control bypass. This may allow any remote unauthenticated user to issue a filter that allows searching for database items they do not have access to, including but not limited to potentially userPassword hashes and other sensitive data.(CVE-2022-1949)\r\n\r\nA denial of service vulnerability was found in the 389-ds-base LDAP server. This issue may allow an authenticated user to cause a server denial of service while attempting to log in with a user with a malformed hash in their password.(CVE-2024-5953)",
