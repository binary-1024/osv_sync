The basic philosophy is to give as few privileges as possible but still allow people to get their work done.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nSudo 1.8.0 through 1.9.12, with the crypt() password backend, contains a plugins/sudoers/auth/passwd.c array-out-of-bounds error that can result in a heap-based buffer over-read. This can be triggered by arbitrary local users with access to Sudo by entering a password of seven characters or fewer.
