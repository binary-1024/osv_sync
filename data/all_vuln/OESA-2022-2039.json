The issue occurs when doing HTTP(S) transfers, where curl might erroneously use the read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send, even when the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set if it previously used the same handle to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback. This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the subsequent `POST` request.(CVE-2022-32221)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/curl&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.71.1-19.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libcurl-devel-7.71.1-19.oe1.aarch64.rpm","curl-debuginfo-7.71.1-19.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libcurl-7.71.1-19.oe1.aarch64.rpm","curl-debugsource-7.71.1-19.oe1.aarch64.rpm","curl-7.71.1-19.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["curl-help-7.71.1-19.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["curl-7.71.1-19.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["curl-debuginfo-7.71.1-19.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libcurl-devel-7.71.1-19.oe1.x86_64.rpm","curl-7.71.1-19.oe1.x86_64.rpm","curl-debugsource-7.71.1-19.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libcurl-7.71.1-19.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-2039.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2022-2039"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32221"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
