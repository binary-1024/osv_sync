Prior to commit number `8a93fdc6c9f4eb1d2f2a11b7ff1d12d70bf5a664`, a bug in Frontier's MODEXP precompile implementation can cause an integer underflow in certain conditions. This will cause a node crash for debug builds. For release builds (and production WebAssembly binaries), the impact is limited as it can only cause a normal EVM out-of-gas. Users who do not use MODEXP precompile in their runtime are not impacted. A patch is available in pull request #549.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-21685.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8a93fdc"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/security/advisories/GHSA-cjg2-2fjg-fph4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/commit/8a93fdc6c9f4eb1d2f2a11b7ff1d12d70bf5a664"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/pull/549"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
