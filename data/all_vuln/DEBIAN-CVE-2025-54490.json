A specially crafted MFER file can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.This vulnerability manifests on line 9090 of biosig.c on the current master branch (35a819fa), when the Tag is 64:\r \r                 else if (tag==64)     //0x40\r                 {\r                     // preamble\r                     char tmp[256];  // [1]\r                     curPos += ifread(tmp,1,len,hdr);\r \r In this case, the overflowed buffer is the newly-declared `tmp` \\[1\\] instead of `buf`. While `tmp` is larger than `buf`, having a size of 256 bytes, a stack overflow can still occur in cases where `len` is encoded using multiple octets and is greater than 256.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"biosig","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/biosig?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.1.2-4","2.3.3-1","2.4.0-1","2.4.0-2","2.5.0-1","2.5.2-1","2.5.2-2","2.6.0-1","2.6.1-1","3.9.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-54490.json"}},{"package":{"name":"biosig","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/biosig?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.5.0-1","2.5.2-1","2.5.2-2","2.6.0-1","2.6.1-1","3.9.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-54490.json"}},{"package":{"name":"biosig","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/biosig?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.9.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-54490.json"}},{"package":{"name":"biosig","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/biosig?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.9.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-54490.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-54490"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
