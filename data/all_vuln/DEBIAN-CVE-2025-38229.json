[1]  Only when the write operation of usb_bulk_msg() in dvb_usb_generic_rw() succeeds and rlen is greater than 0, the read operation of usb_bulk_msg() will be executed to read rlen bytes of data from the dvb device into the rbuf.  In this case, although rlen is 1, the write operation failed which resulted in the dvb read operation not being executed, and ultimately variable i was not initialized.
