Further investigation shows that the crash is due to invalid memory access in stacksafe(). More specifically, it is the following code:      if (exact != NOT_EXACT &&         old->stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE] !=         cur->stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE])             return false;  The 'i' iterates old->allocated_stack. If cur->allocated_stack < old->allocated_stack the out-of-bound access will happen.  To fix the issue add 'i >= cur->allocated_stack' check such that if the condition is true, stacksafe() should fail. Otherwise, cur->stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE] memory access is legal.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.10.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-45020.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.10.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-45020.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-45020"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
