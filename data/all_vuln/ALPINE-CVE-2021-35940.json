The fix for this issue was not carried forward to the APR 1.7.x branch, and hence version 1.7.0 regressed compared to 1.6.3 and is vulnerable to the same issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"apr","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/apr?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.7.0-r1"}]}],"versions":["1.3.3-r0","1.3.5-r0","1.3.7-r0","1.3.8-r0","1.3.9-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.4.2-r1","1.4.2-r2","1.4.2-r3","1.4.2-r4","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.4.5-r2","1.4.5-r3","1.4.6-r0","1.4.8-r0","1.4.8-r1","1.5.0-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.2-r1","1.6.3-r0","1.6.3-r1","1.6.5-r0","1.7.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-35940.json"}},{"package":{"name":"apr","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/apr?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.7.0-r1"}]}],"versions":["1.3.3-r0","1.3.5-r0","1.3.7-r0","1.3.8-r0","1.3.9-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.4.2-r1","1.4.2-r2","1.4.2-r3","1.4.2-r4","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.4.5-r2","1.4.5-r3","1.4.6-r0","1.4.8-r0","1.4.8-r1","1.5.0-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.2-r1","1.6.3-r0","1.6.3-r1","1.6.5-r0","1.7.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-35940.json"}},{"package":{"name":"apr","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/apr?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.7.0-r2"}]}],"versions":["1.3.3-r0","1.3.5-r0","1.3.7-r0","1.3.8-r0","1.3.9-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.4.2-r1","1.4.2-r2","1.4.2-r3","1.4.2-r4","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.4.5-r2","1.4.5-r3","1.4.6-r0","1.4.8-r0","1.4.8-r1","1.5.0-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.2-r1","1.6.3-r0","1.6.3-r1","1.6.5-r0","1.7.0-r0","1.7.0-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-35940.json"}},{"package":{"name":"apr","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/apr?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.7.0-r2"}]}],"versions":["1.3.3-r0","1.3.5-r0","1.3.7-r0","1.3.8-r0","1.3.9-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.4.2-r1","1.4.2-r2","1.4.2-r3","1.4.2-r4","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.4.5-r2","1.4.5-r3","1.4.6-r0","1.4.8-r0","1.4.8-r1","1.5.0-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.2-r1","1.6.3-r0","1.6.3-r1","1.6.5-r0","1.7.0-r0","1.7.0-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-35940.json"}},{"package":{"name":"apr","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/apr?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.7.0-r2"}]}],"versions":["1.3.3-r0","1.3.5-r0","1.3.7-r0","1.3.8-r0","1.3.9-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.4.2-r1","1.4.2-r2","1.4.2-r3","1.4.2-r4","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.4.5-r2","1.4.5-r3","1.4.6-r0","1.4.8-r0","1.4.8-r1","1.5.0-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.2-r1","1.6.3-r0","1.6.3-r1","1.6.5-r0","1.7.0-r0","1.7.0-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-35940.json"}},{"package":{"name":"apr","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/apr?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.7.0-r2"}]}],"versions":["1.3.3-r0","1.3.5-r0","1.3.7-r0","1.3.8-r0","1.3.9-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.4.2-r1","1.4.2-r2","1.4.2-r3","1.4.2-r4","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.4.5-r2","1.4.5-r3","1.4.6-r0","1.4.8-r0","1.4.8-r1","1.5.0-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.2-r1","1.6.3-r0","1.6.3-r1","1.6.5-r0","1.7.0-r0","1.7.0-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-35940.json"}},{"package":{"name":"apr","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/apr?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.7.0-r2"}]}],"versions":["1.3.3-r0","1.3.5-r0","1.3.7-r0","1.3.8-r0","1.3.9-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.4.2-r1","1.4.2-r2","1.4.2-r3","1.4.2-r4","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.4.5-r2","1.4.5-r3","1.4.6-r0","1.4.8-r0","1.4.8-r1","1.5.0-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.2-r1","1.6.3-r0","1.6.3-r1","1.6.5-r0","1.7.0-r0","1.7.0-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-35940.json"}},{"package":{"name":"apr","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/apr?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.7.0-r2"}]}],"versions":["1.3.3-r0","1.3.5-r0","1.3.7-r0","1.3.8-r0","1.3.9-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.4.2-r1","1.4.2-r2","1.4.2-r3","1.4.2-r4","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.4.5-r2","1.4.5-r3","1.4.6-r0","1.4.8-r0","1.4.8-r1","1.5.0-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.2-r1","1.6.3-r0","1.6.3-r1","1.6.5-r0","1.7.0-r0","1.7.0-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-35940.json"}},{"package":{"name":"apr","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/apr?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.7.0-r2
