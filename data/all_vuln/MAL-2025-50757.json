This package appears to be part of the tea.xyz token reward campaign that flooded npm with over 15,000 spam packages in 2024. These packages typically contain autopublish scripts (auto.js, autopublish.js, autopublish2.js, autopublish3.js) designed to automatically generate and publish derivative packages with randomized names to inflate developer reputation scores for tea protocol token rewards. The malicious payload modifies package.json to remove private flags, changes version numbers, generates random Indonesian-themed package names, and continuously republishes variants to pollute the npm registry.\n\n## Source: ghsa-malware (6dc13df0c80f9ea8431c4125c554ee151d80237fa5e6970c7751f5ec3e520772)\nAny computer that has this package installed or running should be considered fully compromised. All secrets and keys stored on that computer should be rotated immediately from a different computer. The package should be removed, but as full control of the computer may have been given to an outside entity, there is no guarantee that removing the package will remove all malicious software resulting from installing it.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"adyen-web-v5","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/adyen-web-v5"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"cwes":[{"cweId":"CWE-506","description":"The product contains code that appears to be malicious in nature.","name":"Embedded Malicious Code"}],"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/npm/adyen-web-v5/MAL-2025-50757.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jcxx-7rcc-8rw7"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2025-11-10T04:41:42.977571369Z","modified_time":"2025-11-10T04:05:19Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"SEMVER"}],"sha256":"25b6c05640ee26217a85a428224b5a1a72790f5efec2d036828cb3cda0afa5ab","source":"amazon-inspector"},{"id":"GHSA-jcxx-7rcc-8rw7","import_time":"2026-01-08T00:42:59.930897006Z","modified_time":"2026-01-07T23:51:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"SEMVER"}],"sha256":"6dc13df0c80f9ea8431c4125c554ee151d80237fa5e6970c7751f5ec3e520772","source":"ghsa-malware"}]},"credits":[{"name":"Amazon Inspector","contact":["actran@amazon.com"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
