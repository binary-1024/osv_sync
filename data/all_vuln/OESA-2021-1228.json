  "details": "The xdg-utils package is a set of simple scripts that provide basic desktop integration functions for any Free Desktop, such as Linux. The following tools are included in xdg-utils: * xdg-desktop-menu      Install desktop menu items * xdg-desktop-icon      Install icons to the desktop * xdg-icon-resource     Install icon resources * xdg-mime              Query information about file type handling and                         install descriptions for new file types * xdg-open              Open a file or URL in the user&apos;s preferred application * xdg-email             Send mail using the user&apos;s preferred e-mail composer * xdg-screensaver       Control the screensaver\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the xdg-email component of xdg-utils-1.1.0-rc1 and newer. When handling mailto: URIs, xdg-email allows attachments to be discreetly added via the URI when being passed to Thunderbird. An attacker could potentially send a victim a URI that automatically attaches a sensitive file to a new email. If a victim user does not notice that an attachment was added and sends the email, this could result in sensitive information disclosure. It has been confirmed that the code behind this issue is in xdg-email and not in Thunderbird.(CVE-2020-27748)",
