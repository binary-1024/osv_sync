  "details": "PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. PHP attempts to make it easy for developers to write dynamically generated web pages. PHP also offers built-in database integration for several commercial and non-commercial database management systems, so writing a database-enabled webpage with PHP is fairly simple. The most common use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI scripts. The php package contains the module (often referred to as mod_php) which adds support for the PHP language to Apache HTTP Server.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in PHP. This issue occurs due to an uncaught integer overflow in PDO::quote() of PDO_SQLite returning an improperly quoted string. With the implementation of sqlite3_snprintf(), it is possible to force the function to return a single apostrophe if the function is called on user-supplied input without any length restrictions in place.(CVE-2022-31631)\r\n\r\nIn PHP 8.0.X before 8.0.28, 8.1.X before 8.1.16 and 8.2.X before 8.2.3, password_verify() function may accept some invalid Blowfish hashes as valid. If such invalid hash ever ends up in the password database, it may lead to an application allowing any password for this entry as valid.(CVE-2023-0567)\r\n\r\nIn PHP 8.0.X before 8.0.28, 8.1.X before 8.1.16 and 8.2.X before 8.2.3, core path resolution function allocate buffer one byte too small. When resolving paths with lengths close to system MAXPATHLEN setting, this may lead to the byte after the allocated buffer being overwritten with NUL value, which might lead to unauthorized data access or modification.\u00a0(CVE-2023-0568)\r\n\r\nIn PHP 8.0.X before 8.0.28, 8.1.X before 8.1.16 and 8.2.X before 8.2.3, excessive number of parts in HTTP form upload can cause high resource consumption and excessive number of log entries. This can cause denial of service on the affected server by exhausting CPU resources or disk space.\u00a0(CVE-2023-0662)\r\n\r\nIn PHP versions 8.0.* before 8.0.29, 8.1.* before 8.1.20, 8.2.* before 8.2.7 when using SOAP HTTP Digest Authentication, random value generator was not checked for failure, and was using narrower range of values than it should have. In case of random generator failure, it could lead to a disclosure of 31 bits of uninitialized memory from the client to the server, and it also made easier to a malicious server to guess the client&apos;s nonce.\u00a0\r\n\r\n(CVE-2023-3247)\r\n\r\nIn PHP versions 8.0.* before 8.0.30, 8.1.* before 8.1.22, and 8.2.* before 8.2.8 various XML functions rely on libxml global state to track configuration variables, like whether external entities are loaded. This state is assumed to be unchanged unless the user explicitly changes it by calling appropriate function. However, since the state is process-global, other modules - such as\u00a0ImageMagick - may also use this library within the same process, and change that global state for their internal purposes, and leave it in a state where external entities loading is enabled. This can lead to the situation where external XML is parsed with external entities loaded, which can lead to disclosure of any local files accessible to PHP. This vulnerable state may persist in the same process across many requests, until the process is shut down.\u00a0\r\n\r\n(CVE-2023-3823)\r\n\r\nIn PHP version 8.0.* before 8.0.30,\u00a0 8.1.* before 8.1.22, and 8.2.* before 8.2.8, when loading phar file, while reading PHAR directory entries, insufficient length checking may lead to a stack buffer overflow, leading potentially to memory corruption or RCE.\u00a0\r\n\r\n(CVE-2023-3824)",
