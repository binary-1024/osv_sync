  "details": "In the Google Analytics admin web interface, current as of 2022-05-19 an information leakage exists in the Account Access Management and Property Access Management that can be used, resulting in an attacker determining if a Google-hosted email address is in fact a Google account or a google group, an alias to a user, or a user account. Additionally, if it is an alias Google will report the real email address associated with the alias.\r\n\r\nIf it's an account it will add it (e.g. kurt@seifried.org).\r\n\r\nIf it's a google group it will error out with: \"Failed to register users\" (e.g. group@seifried.org)\r\n\r\nIf it is an alias, it will error out with \"One of the email addresses entered is the alternate email address of a Google Account (e.g. alias@seifried.org). The alternate email address has been changed to that account's primary email address.\" and it will change the email alias to the correct email.\r\n",
