An attacker capable of precisely measuring the time taken for ECC key generation may be able to derive information about the high bits of the secret key, as the function to derive the public point from the secret scalar uses an unblinded Montgomery ladder whose loop iteration count depends on the bitlength of the secret. This issue affects only key generation, not ECDSA signatures or ECDH key agreement.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/botan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.5.0-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.7.0-r0","2.7.0-r1","2.7.0-r2","2.8.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-20187.json"}},{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/botan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.5.0-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.7.0-r0","2.7.0-r1","2.7.0-r2","2.8.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-20187.json"}},{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/botan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.5.0-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.7.0-r0","2.7.0-r1","2.7.0-r2","2.8.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-20187.json"}},{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/botan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.5.0-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.7.0-r0","2.7.0-r1","2.7.0-r2","2.8.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-20187.json"}},{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/botan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.5.0-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.7.0-r0","2.7.0-r1","2.7.0-r2","2.8.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-20187.json"}},{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/botan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.5.0-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.7.0-r0","2.7.0-r1","2.7.0-r2","2.8.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-20187.json"}},{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/botan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.5.0-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.7.0-r0","2.7.0-r1","2.7.0-r2","2.8.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-20187.json"}},{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/botan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.5.0-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.7.0-r0","2.7.0-r1","2.7.0-r2","2.8.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-20187.json"}},{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/botan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.5.0-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.7.0-r0","2.7.0-r1","2.7.0-r2","2.8.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-20187.json"}},{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/botan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.5.0-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.7.0-r0","2.7.0-r1","2.7.0-r2","2.8.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-20187.json"}},{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/botan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.5.0-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.7.0-r0","2.7.0-r1","2.7.0-r2","2.8.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-20187.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2018-20187"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
