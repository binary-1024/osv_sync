{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47334","published":"2024-05-21T15:15:20Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:16:38.249148Z","upstream":["CVE-2021-47334"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  misc/libmasm/module: Fix two use after free in ibmasm_init_one  In ibmasm_init_one, it calls ibmasm_init_remote_input_dev(). Inside ibmasm_init_remote_input_dev, mouse_dev and keybd_dev are allocated by input_allocate_device(), and assigned to sp->remote.mouse_dev and sp->remote.keybd_dev respectively.  In the err_free_devices error branch of ibmasm_init_one, mouse_dev and keybd_dev are freed by input_free_device(), and return error. Then the execution runs into error_send_message error branch of ibmasm_init_one, where ibmasm_free_remote_input_dev(sp) is called to unregister the freed sp->remote.mouse_dev and sp->remote.keybd_dev.  My patch add a \"error_init_remote\" label to handle the error of ibmasm_init_remote_input_dev(), to avoid the uaf bugs.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.70-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47334.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.14.6-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47334.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.14.6-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47334.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.14.6-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47334.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-47334"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
