The fix applied for CVE-2023-39515 in version 1.2.25 is incomplete as it enables an adversary to have a victim browser execute malicious code when a victim user hovers their mouse over the malicious data source path in `data_debug.php`. To perform the cross-site scripting attack, the adversary needs to be an authorized cacti user with the following permissions: `General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data`. The victim of this attack could be any account with permissions to view `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_debug.php`. As of time of publication, no complete fix has been included in Cacti.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"cacti","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/cacti?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.16+ds1-2+deb11u3"}]}],"versions":["1.2.16+ds1-2","1.2.16+ds1-2+deb11u1","1.2.16+ds1-2+deb11u2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-49088.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cacti","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/cacti?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.24+ds1-1+deb12u2"}]}],"versions":["1.2.24+ds1-1","1.2.24+ds1-1+deb12u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-49088.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cacti","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/cacti?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.26+ds1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-49088.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cacti","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/cacti?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.26+ds1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-49088.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-49088"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
