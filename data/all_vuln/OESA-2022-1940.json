  "details": "The Linux Kernel, the operating system core itself.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the KVM&apos;s AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the &quot;virt_ext&quot; field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS (Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape.(CVE-2021-3656)\r\n\r\nAn out of memory bounds write flaw (1 or 2 bytes of memory) in the Linux kernel NFS subsystem was found in the way users use mirroring (replication of files with NFS). A user, having access to the NFS mount, could potentially use this flaw to crash the system or escalate privileges on the system.(CVE-2021-4157)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the sctp_make_strreset_req function in net/sctp/sm_make_chunk.c in the SCTP network protocol in the Linux kernel with a local user privilege access. In this flaw, an attempt to use more buffer than is allocated triggers a BUG_ON issue, leading to a denial of service (DOS).(CVE-2022-0322)\r\n\r\n** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: none. Reason: This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA. Further investigation showed that it was not a security issue. Notes: none.(CVE-2021-3894)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel before 5.15.3, fs/quota/quota_tree.c does not validate the block number in the quota tree (on disk). This can, for example, lead to a kernel/locking/rwsem.c use-after-free if there is a corrupted quota file.(CVE-2021-45868)\n\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw in diFree in fs/jfs/inode.c in Journaled File System (JFS)in the Linux kernel. This could allow a local attacker to crash the system or leak kernel internal information.(CVE-2022-3202)",
