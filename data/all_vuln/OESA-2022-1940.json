The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the &quot;virt_ext&quot; field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS (Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape.(CVE-2021-3656)\r\n\r\nAn out of memory bounds write flaw (1 or 2 bytes of memory) in the Linux kernel NFS subsystem was found in the way users use mirroring (replication of files with NFS). A user, having access to the NFS mount, could potentially use this flaw to crash the system or escalate privileges on the system.(CVE-2021-4157)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the sctp_make_strreset_req function in net/sctp/sm_make_chunk.c in the SCTP network protocol in the Linux kernel with a local user privilege access. In this flaw, an attempt to use more buffer than is allocated triggers a BUG_ON issue, leading to a denial of service (DOS).(CVE-2022-0322)\r\n\r\n** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: none. Reason: This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA. Further investigation showed that it was not a security issue. Notes: none.(CVE-2021-3894)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel before 5.15.3, fs/quota/quota_tree.c does not validate the block number in the quota tree (on disk). This can, for example, lead to a kernel/locking/rwsem.c use-after-free if there is a corrupted quota file.(CVE-2021-45868)\n\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw in diFree in fs/jfs/inode.c in Journaled File System (JFS)in the Linux kernel. This could allow a local attacker to crash the system or leak kernel internal information.(CVE-2022-3202)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kernel","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/kernel&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python3-perf-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.aarch64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.aarch64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["kernel-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.x86_64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.x86_64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-4.19.90-2209.5.0.0169.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1940.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2022-1940"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3656"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-4157"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0322"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3894"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45868"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3202"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
