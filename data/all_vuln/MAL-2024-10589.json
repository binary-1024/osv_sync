Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (5d702b14386f2cc53fc32351efb9b53292d3852747fc7b5cafbba01b85d9f643)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'raylinks' @ 92.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"raylinks","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/raylinks"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["92.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/raylinks/MAL-2024-10589.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/raylinks"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["byted-dast.com"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-11-12T05:05:31.234724638Z","modified_time":"2024-11-12T04:46:05Z","sha256":"5d702b14386f2cc53fc32351efb9b53292d3852747fc7b5cafbba01b85d9f643","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["92.6"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/raylinks","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:56.363066437Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"4c8e187b91b774d56b13783331f7c5a590256a928dc007f78e721753737ca425","source":"kam193"},{"id":"pypi/2024-11-byted-dast/raylinks","import_time":"2025-12-02T23:07:19.550545384Z","modified_time":"2024-11-06T18:46:10Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"5bbc9e99f85f6f16d26609cd46995924994ad4e3d01fccd9d23cd5d34f4abf32","source":"kam193"}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"REPORTER"},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
