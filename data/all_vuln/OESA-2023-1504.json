The vulnerability only affects applications that use an LDAP CertStore from Bouncy Castle to validate X.509 certificates. During the certificate validation process, Bouncy Castle inserts the certificate&apos;s Subject Name into an LDAP search filter without any escaping, which leads to an LDAP injection vulnerability.(CVE-2023-33201)",
