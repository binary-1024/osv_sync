{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-9820","published":"2026-01-26T20:16:09.370Z","modified":"2026-01-28T05:49:32.548342Z","related":["MGASA-2025-0317","SUSE-SU-2025:4271-1","SUSE-SU-2025:4272-1","SUSE-SU-2025:4323-1"],"details":"A flaw was found in the GnuTLS library, specifically in the gnutls_pkcs11_token_init() function that handles PKCS#11 token initialization. When a token label longer than expected is processed, the function writes past the end of a fixed-size stack buffer. This programming error can cause the application using GnuTLS to crash or, in certain conditions, be exploited for code execution. As a result, systems or applications relying on GnuTLS may be vulnerable to a denial of service or local privilege escalation attacks.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1d56f96f6ab5034d677136b9d50b5a75dff0faf5"}]}],"versions":["3.6.12","3.6.13","3.6.14","3.7.0","3.7.1","3.7.2","3.7.3","3.7.4","3.7.5","3.7.6","3.7.7","3.7.8","3.8.0","3.8.1","3.8.10","3.8.2","3.8.3","3.8.4","3.8.5","3.8.6","3.8.7","3.8.8","3.8.9","gnutls-0-0-7","gnutls-0-1-0-srp","gnutls-0_1_2","gnutls-3_0_12","gnutls0-0-4","gnutls0-0-5","gnutls0-0-6","gnutls_0_1_4","gnutls_0_1_9","gnutls_0_2_0","gnutls_0_2_1","gnutls_0_2_10","gnutls_0_2_11","gnutls_0_2_2","gnutls_0_2_3","gnutls_0_2_4","gnutls_0_2_9","gnutls_0_2_90","gnutls_0_2_91","gnutls_0_3_0","gnutls_0_3_1","gnutls_0_3_2","gnutls_0_3_90","gnutls_0_3_91","gnutls_0_3_92","gnutls_0_4_0","gnutls_0_4_1","gnutls_0_4_2","gnutls_0_4_3","gnutls_0_4_with_libtasn1","gnutls_0_5_0","gnutls_0_5_1","gnutls_0_5_10","gnutls_0_5_11","gnutls_0_5_4","gnutls_0_5_5","gnutls_0_5_6","gnutls_0_5_7","gnutls_0_5_8","gnutls_0_5_9","gnutls_0_5_x_before_export_ciphersuites","gnutls_0_5_x_before_int_fixes","gnutls_0_5_x_before_types_change","gnutls_0_5_x_with_export_ciphersuites","gnutls_0_6_0","gnutls_0_8_0","gnutls_0_8_1","gnutls_0_9_1","gnutls_0_9_2","gnutls_0_9_3","gnutls_0_9_4","gnutls_0_9_5","gnutls_0_9_6","gnutls_0_9_7","gnutls_0_9_8","gnutls_0_9_90","gnutls_0_9_91","gnutls_0_9_92","gnutls_0_9_93","gnutls_0_9_94","gnutls_0_9_95","gnutls_0_9_96","gnutls_0_9_97","gnutls_0_9_98","gnutls_0_9_99","gnutls_1_0_0","gnutls_1_0_20","gnutls_1_0_21","gnutls_1_0_22","gnutls_1_0_23","gnutls_1_0_24","gnutls_1_0_25","gnutls_1_1_0","gnutls_1_1_1","gnutls_1_1_10","gnutls_1_1_11","gnutls_1_1_12","gnutls_1_1_13","gnutls_1_1_14","gnutls_1_1_15","gnutls_1_1_16","gnutls_1_1_17","gnutls_1_1_18","gnutls_1_1_19","gnutls_1_1_2","gnutls_1_1_20","gnutls_1_1_21","gnutls_1_1_22","gnutls_1_1_23","gnutls_1_1_3","gnutls_1_1_4","gnutls_1_1_5","gnutls_1_1_6","gnutls_1_1_7","gnutls_1_1_7_pre0","gnutls_1_1_8","gnutls_1_1_9","gnutls_1_2_0","gnutls_1_2_1","gnutls_1_2_10","gnutls_1_2_11","gnutls_1_2_2","gnutls_1_2_3","gnutls_1_2_4","gnutls_1_2_5","gnutls_1_2_6","gnutls_1_2_7","gnutls_1_2_8","gnutls_1_2_9","gnutls_1_3_0","gnutls_1_3_1","gnutls_1_3_2","gnutls_1_3_3","gnutls_1_3_4","gnutls_1_3_5","gnutls_1_4_0","gnutls_1_4_1","gnutls_1_4_2","gnutls_1_5_0","gnutls_1_5_1","gnutls_1_5_2","gnutls_1_5_3","gnutls_1_5_4","gnutls_1_5_5","gnutls_1_6_0","gnutls_1_6_1","gnutls_1_7_0","gnutls_1_7_1","gnutls_1_7_10","gnutls_1_7_11","gnutls_1_7_12","gnutls_1_7_13","gnutls_1_7_14","gnutls_1_7_15","gnutls_1_7_16","gnutls_1_7_17","gnutls_1_7_18","gnutls_1_7_19","gnutls_1_7_2","gnutls_1_7_3","gnutls_1_7_4","gnutls_1_7_5","gnutls_1_7_6","gnutls_1_7_7","gnutls_1_7_8","gnutls_1_7_9","gnutls_2_0_0","gnutls_2_0_1","gnutls_2_11_3","gnutls_2_11_4","gnutls_2_11_5","gnutls_2_11_6","gnutls_2_1_0","gnutls_2_1_1","gnutls_2_1_2","gnutls_2_1_3","gnutls_2_1_4","gnutls_2_1_5","gnutls_2_1_6","gnutls_2_1_7","gnutls_2_1_8","gnutls_2_3_0","gnutls_2_3_1","gnutls_2_3_10","gnutls_2_3_11","gnutls_2_3_12","gnutls_2_3_13","gnutls_2_3_14","gnutls_2_3_15","gnutls_2_3_2","gnutls_2_3_3","gnutls_2_3_4","gnutls_2_3_4_netconf_0","gnutls_2_3_4_netconf_1","gnutls_2_3_4_netconf_2","gnutls_2_3_5","gnutls_2_3_6","gnutls_2_3_7","gnutls_2_3_8","gnutls_2_3_9","gnutls_2_4_0","gnutls_2_5_0","gnutls_2_5_1","gnutls_2_5_2","gnutls_2_5_3","gnutls_2_5_4","gnutls_2_5_5","gnutls_2_5_6","gnutls_2_5_7","gnutls_2_5_8","gnutls_2_5_9","gnutls_2_7_0","gnutls_2_7_1","gnutls_2_7_10","gnutls_2_7_11","gnutls_2_7_12","gnutls_2_7_13","gnutls_2_7_14","gnutls_2_7_2","gnutls_2_7_3","gnutls_2_7_4","gnutls_2_7_5","gnutls_2_7_6","gnutls_2_7_7","gnutls_2_7_8","gnutls_2_7_9","gnutls_2_8_0","gnutls_2_99_0","gnutls_2_99_1","gnutls_2_99_2","gnutls_2_99_3","gnutls_2_99_4","gnutls_2_9_0","gnutls_2_9_1","gnutls_2_9_10","gnutls_2_9_2","gnutls_2_9_3","gnutls_2_9_4","gnutls_2_9_5","gnutls_2_9_6","gnutls_2_9_7","gnutls_2_9_8","gnutls_2_9_9","gnutls_3_0_0","gnutls_3_0_10","gnutls_3_0_11","gnutls_3_0_13","gnutls_3_0_14","gnutls_3_0_15","gnutls_3_0_16","gnutls_3_0_17","gnutls_3_0_18","gnutls_3_0_2","gnutls_3_0_21","gnutls_3_0_3","gnutls_3_0_4","gnutls_3_0_5","gnutls_3_0_6","gnutls_3_0_7","gnutls_3_0_8","gnutls_3_0_9","gnutls_3_1_0","gnutls_3_1_0pre0","gnutls_3_1_2","gnutls_3_1_3","gnutls_3_1_4","gnutls_3_1_5","gnutls_3_1_6","gnutls_3_1_7","gnutls_3_1_8","gnutls_3_1_9","gnutls_3_2_0","gnutls_3_2_2","gnutls_3_2_3","gnutls_3_2_3pre0","gnutls_3_2_4","gnutls_3_2_5","gnutls_3_2_6","gnutls_3_3_0","gnutls_3_3_1","gnutls_3_3_2","gnutls_3_3_3","gnutls_3_3_4","gnutls_3_3_5","gnutls_3_3_6","gnutls_3_4_0","gnutls_3_4_1","gnutls_3_4_2","gnutls_3_4_3","gnutls_3_5_0","gnutls_3_5_1","gnutls_3_5_2","gnutls_3_5_3","gnutls_3_5_4","gnutls_3_5_5","gnutls_3_5_7","gnutls_3_6_0","gnutls_3_6_0_1","gnutls_3_6_1","gnutls_3_6_10","gnutls_3_6_11","gnutls_3_6_11_1","gnutls_3_6_12","gnutls_3_6_2","gnutls_3_6_3","gnutls_3_6_4","gnutls_3_6_5","gnutls_3_6_6","gnutls_3_6_7","gnutls_3_6_9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://s
