An off-by-one error when processing malformed TLS-CBC ciphertext could cause the receiving side to include in the HMAC computation exactly 64K bytes of data following the record buffer, aka an over-read. The MAC comparison will subsequently fail and the connection will be closed. This could be used for denial of service. No information leak occurs.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"botan1.10","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:Pro:14.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/botan1.10@1.10.5-1+deb7u1ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1?arch=source&distro=esm-infra-legacy/trusty"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.5-1","1.10.5-1ubuntu1","1.10.5-1+deb7u1ubuntu0.14.04.1","1.10.5-1+deb7u1ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"libbotan-1.10-0","binary_version":"1.10.5-1+deb7u1ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libbotan1.10-dev","binary_version":"1.10.5-1+deb7u1ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2018/UBUNTU-CVE-2018-9860.json"}},{"package":{"name":"botan","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/botan@2.4.0-5ubuntu1?arch=source&distro=bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.0-3","2.4.0-4","2.4.0-5ubuntu1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"botan","binary_version":"2.4.0-5ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"libbotan-2-4","binary_version":"2.4.0-5ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"libbotan-2-dev","binary_version":"2.4.0-5ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"python3-botan","binary_version":"2.4.0-5ubuntu1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2018/UBUNTU-CVE-2018-9860.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-9860"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/randombit/botan/commit/ec222c99719c396a1f4756b2ca345dbbfbeb5ed5"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-9860"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
