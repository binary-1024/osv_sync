{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-38470","published":"2025-07-28T12:15:28Z","modified":"2025-10-13T11:20:01.219965Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-38470"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: vlan: fix VLAN 0 refcount imbalance of toggling filtering during runtime  Assuming the \"rx-vlan-filter\" feature is enabled on a net device, the 8021q module will automatically add or remove VLAN 0 when the net device is put administratively up or down, respectively. There are a couple of problems with the above scheme.  The first problem is a memory leak that can happen if the \"rx-vlan-filter\" feature is disabled while the device is running:   # ip link add bond1 up type bond mode 0  # ethtool -K bond1 rx-vlan-filter off  # ip link del dev bond1  When the device is put administratively down the \"rx-vlan-filter\" feature is disabled, so the 8021q module will not remove VLAN 0 and the memory will be leaked [1].  Another problem that can happen is that the kernel can automatically delete VLAN 0 when the device is put administratively down despite not adding it when the device was put administratively up since during that time the \"rx-vlan-filter\" feature was disabled. null-ptr-unref or bug_on[2] will be triggered by unregister_vlan_dev() for refcount imbalance if toggling filtering during runtime:  $ ip link add bond0 type bond mode 0 $ ip link add link bond0 name vlan0 type vlan id 0 protocol 802.1q $ ethtool -K bond0 rx-vlan-filter off $ ifconfig bond0 up $ ethtool -K bond0 rx-vlan-filter on $ ifconfig bond0 down $ ip link del vlan0  Root cause is as below: step1: add vlan0 for real_dev, such as bond, team. register_vlan_dev     vlan_vid_add(real_dev,htons(ETH_P_8021Q),0) //refcnt=1 step2: disable vlan filter feature and enable real_dev step3: change filter from 0 to 1 vlan_device_event     vlan_filter_push_vids         ndo_vlan_rx_add_vid //No refcnt added to real_dev vlan0 step4: real_dev down vlan_device_event     vlan_vid_del(dev, htons(ETH_P_8021Q), 0); //refcnt=0         vlan_info_rcu_free //free vlan0 step5: delete vlan0 unregister_vlan_dev     BUG_ON(!vlan_info); //vlan_info is null  Fix both problems by noting in the VLAN info whether VLAN 0 was automatically added upon NETDEV_UP and based on that decide whether it should be deleted upon NETDEV_DOWN, regardless of the state of the \"rx-vlan-filter\" feature.
