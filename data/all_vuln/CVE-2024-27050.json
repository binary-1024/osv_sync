  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlibbpf: Use OPTS_SET() macro in bpf_xdp_query()\n\nWhen the feature_flags and xdp_zc_max_segs fields were added to the libbpf\nbpf_xdp_query_opts, the code writing them did not use the OPTS_SET() macro.\nThis causes libbpf to write to those fields unconditionally, which means\nthat programs compiled against an older version of libbpf (with a smaller\nsize of the bpf_xdp_query_opts struct) will have its stack corrupted by\nlibbpf writing out of bounds.\n\nThe patch adding the feature_flags field has an early bail out if the\nfeature_flags field is not part of the opts struct (via the OPTS_HAS)\nmacro, but the patch adding xdp_zc_max_segs does not. For consistency, this\nfix just changes the assignments to both fields to use the OPTS_SET()\nmacro.",
