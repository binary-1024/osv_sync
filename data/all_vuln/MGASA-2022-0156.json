  "summary": "Updated firefox/nss/rootcerts packages fix security vulnerability",
  "details": "NSSToken objects were referenced via direct points, and could have been\naccessed in an unsafe way on different threads, leading to a use-after-free\nand potentially exploitable crash (CVE-2022-1097).\n\nAfter a VR Process is destroyed, a reference to it may have been retained and\nused, leading to a use-after-free and potentially exploitable crash\n(CVE-2022-1196).\n\nThe rust regex crate did not properly prevent crafted regular expressions from\ntaking an arbitrary amount of time during parsing. If an attacker was able to\nsupply input to this crate, they could have caused a denial of service in the\nbrowser (CVE-2022-24713).\n\nIf a compromised content process sent an unexpected number of WebAuthN\nExtensions in a Register command to the parent process, an out of bounds write\nwould have occurred leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable\ncrash (CVE-2022-28281).\n\nBy using a link with rel=\"localization\" a use-after-free in\nDocumentL10n::TranslateDocument could have been triggered by destroying an\nobject during JavaScript execution and then referencing the object through a\nfreed pointer, leading to a potential exploitable crash (CVE-2022-28282).\n\nWhen generating the assembly code for MLoadTypedArrayElementHole, an incorrect\nAliasSet was used in JIT Codegen. In conjunction with another vulnerability\nthis could have been used for an out of bounds memory read (CVE-2022-28285).\n\nDue to a layout change, iframe contents could have been rendered outside of\nits border. This could have led to user confusion or spoofing attacks\n(CVE-2022-28286).\n\nMozilla developers and community members Nika Layzell (ni? for response), the\nMozilla Fuzzing Team, Andrew McCreight, Gabriele Svelto (pto) reported memory\nsafety bugs present in Firefox ESR 91.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of\nmemory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could\nhave been exploited to run arbitrary code (CVE-2022-28289).\n\nxmltok_impl.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5 lacks certain validation of\nencoding, such as checks for whether a UTF-8 character is valid in a certain\ncontext. (CVE-2022-25235)\nxmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5 allows attackers to insert\nnamespace-separator characters into namespace URIs. (CVE-2022-25236)\n\nAn integer overflow was found in expat. The issue occurs in storeRawNames ()\nby abusing the m_buffer expansion logic to allow allocations very close to\nINT_MAX and out-of-bounds heap writes. (CVE-2022-25315)\n",
