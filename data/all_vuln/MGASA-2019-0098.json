  "details": "This kernel-linus update is based on the upstream 4.14.100 and fixes at least\nthe following security issues:\n\nCross-hyperthread Spectre v2 mitigation is now provided by the Single\nThread Indirect Branch Predictors (STIBP) support. Note that STIBP also\nrequires the functionality be supported by the Intel microcode in use.\n\nIt was found that cephx authentication protocol did not verify ceph clients\ncorrectly and was vulnerable to replay attack. Any attacker having access\nto ceph cluster network who is able to sniff packets on network can use\nthis vulnerability to authenticate with ceph service and perform actions\nallowed by ceph service (CVE-2018-1128).\n\nA flaw was found in the way signature calculation was handled by cephx\nauthentication protocol. An attacker having access to ceph cluster network\nwho is able to alter the message payload was able to bypass signature\nchecks done by cephx protocol (CVE-2018-1129).\n\nA flaw was found in the Linux Kernel where an attacker may be able to have\nan uncontrolled read to kernel-memory from within a vm guest. A race\ncondition between connect() and close() function may allow an attacker\nusing the AF_VSOCK protocol to gather a 4 byte information leak or possibly\nintercept or corrupt AF_VSOCK messages destined to other clients\n(CVE-2018-14625).\n\nA security flaw was found in the Linux kernel in a way that the cleancache\nsubsystem clears an inode after the final file truncation (removal). The\nnew file created with the same inode may contain leftover pages from\ncleancache and the old file data instead of the new one (CVE-2018-16862).\n\nA use-after-free issue was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM\nhypervisor processed posted interrupts when nested(=1) virtualization is\nenabled. In nested_get_vmcs12_pages(), in case of an error while\nprocessing posted interrupt address, it unmaps the 'pi_desc_page' without\nresetting 'pi_desc' descriptor address, which is later used in\npi_test_and_clear_on(). A guest user/process could use this flaw to crash\nthe host kernel resulting in DoS or potentially gain privileged access to\na system (CVE-2018-16882).\n\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's NFS41+ subsystem. NFS41+ shares\nmounted in different network namespaces at the same time can make\nbc_svc_process() use wrong back-channel IDs and cause a use-after-free\nvulnerability. Thus a malicious container user can cause a host kernel\nmemory corruption and a system panic. Due to the nature of the flaw,\nprivilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out (CVE-2018-16884).\n\nThe userfaultfd implementation in the Linux kernel before 4.19.7 mishandles\naccess control for certain UFFDIO_ ioctl calls, as demonstrated by allowing\nlocal users to write data into holes in a tmpfs file (if the user has\nread-only access to that file, and that file contains holes)\n(CVE-2018-18397).\n\nIn the Linux kernel through 4.19.6, a local user could exploit a\nuse-after-free in the ALSA driver by supplying a malicious USB Sound device\n(with zero interfaces) (CVE-2018-19824).\n\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the function hso_probe() which\nreads if_num value from the USB device (as an u8) and uses it without a\nlength check to index an array, resulting in an OOB memory read in\nhso_probe() or hso_get_config_data(). An attacker with a forged USB\ndevice and physical access to a system (needed to connect such a device)\ncan cause a system crash and a denial of service (CVE-2018-19985).\n\nAn issue was discovered in can_can_gw_rcv in net/can/gw.c in the Linux\nkernel through 4.19.13. The CAN frame modification rules allow bitwise\nlogical operations that can be also applied to the can_dlc field. Because\nof a missing check, the CAN drivers may write arbitrary content beyond\nthe data registers in the CAN controller's I/O memory when processing\ncan-gw manipulated outgoing frames. This is related to cgw_csum_xor_rel.\nAn unprivileged user can trigger a system crash (general protection fault)\n(CVE-2019-3701).\n\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the function hid_debug_events_read()\nin drivers/hid/hid-debug.c file which may enter an infinite loop with\ncertain parameters passed from a userspace. A local privileged user (\"root\")\ncan cause a system lock up and a denial of service (CVE-2019-3819).\n\nIn the Linux kernel before 4.20.8, kvm_ioctl_create_device in\nvirt/kvm/kvm_main.c mishandles reference counting because of a race\ncondition, leading to a use-after-free (CVE-2019-6974).\n\nA use-after-free vulnerability was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM\nhypervisor emulates a preemption timer for L2 guests when nested (=1)\nvirtualization is enabled. This high resolution timer(hrtimer) runs when\na L2 guest is active. After VM exit, the sync_vmcs12() timer object is\nstopped. The use-after-free occurs if the timer object is freed before\ncalling sync_vmcs12() routine. A guest user/process could use this flaw\nto crash the host kernel resulting in a denial of service or, potentially,\ngain privileged access to a system (CVE-2019-7221).\n\nAn information leakage issue was found in the way Linux kernel's KVM\nhypervisor handled page fault exceptions while emulating instructions\nlike VMXON, VMCLEAR, VMPTRLD, and VMWRITE with memory address as an\noperand. It occurs if the operand is a mmio address, as the returned\nexception object holds uninitialized stack memory contents. A guest\nuser/process could use this flaw to leak host's stack memory contents\nto a guest (CVE-2019-7222).\n\nFor other uptstream fixes in this update, see the referenced changelogs.\n",
