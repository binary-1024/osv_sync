{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2006-6893","published":"2006-12-31T05:00:00Z","modified":"2025-08-09T19:01:27Z","details":"Tor allows remote attackers to discover the IP address of a hidden service by accessing this service at a high rate, thereby changing the server's CPU temperature and consequently changing the pattern of time values visible through (1) ICMP timestamps, (2) TCP sequence numbers, and (3) TCP timestamps, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-0414. NOTE: it could be argued that this is a laws-of-physics vulnerability that is a fundamental design limitation of certain hardware implementations, so perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE.","references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sjm217/papers/ccs06hotornot.pdf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1513.en.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2006/09/04/hot-or-not-revealing-hidden-services-by-their-clock-skew/"}]}
