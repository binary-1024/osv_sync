  "details": "The go programming language\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nGo before 1.15.13 and 1.16.x before 1.16.5 has functions for DNS lookups that do not validate replies from DNS servers, and thus a return value may contain an unsafe injection (e.g., XSS) that does not conform to the RFC1035 format.(CVE-2021-33195)\n\nIn archive/zip in Go before 1.15.13 and 1.16.x before 1.16.5, a crafted file count (in an archive s header) can cause a NewReader or OpenReader panic.(CVE-2021-33196)\n\nIn Go before 1.15.13 and 1.16.x before 1.16.5, some configurations of ReverseProxy (from net/http/httputil) result in a situation where an attacker is able to drop arbitrary headers.(CVE-2021-33197)\n\nIn Go before 1.15.13 and 1.16.x before 1.16.5, there can be a panic for a large exponent to the math/big.Rat SetString or UnmarshalText method.(CVE-2021-33198)\n\nThe crypto/tls package of Go through 1.16.5 does not properly assert that the type of public key in an X.509 certificate matches the expected type when doing a RSA based key exchange, allowing a malicious TLS server to cause a TLS client to panic.(CVE-2021-34558)\n\nGo before 1.17 does not properly consider extraneous zero characters at the beginning of an IP address octet, which (in some situations) allows attackers to bypass access control that is based on IP addresses, because of unexpected octal interpretation. This affects net.ParseIP and net.ParseCIDR.(CVE-2021-29923)\n\nGo before 1.16.9 and 1.17.x before 1.17.2 has a Buffer Overflow via large arguments in a function invocation from a WASM module, when GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js is used.(CVE-2021-38297)\n\nGo before 1.15.15 and 1.16.x before 1.16.7 has a race condition that can lead to a net/http/httputil ReverseProxy panic upon an ErrAbortHandler abort.(CVE-2021-36221)",
