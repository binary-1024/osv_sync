{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68137","published":"2026-01-21T19:20:09.059Z","modified":"2026-01-22T02:56:26.549341Z","aliases":["GHSA-7qq4-q9r8-wc7w"],"summary":"EVerest's Integer Overflow and Signed to Unsigned conversion lead to either stack buffer overflow or infinite loop","details":"EVerest is an EV charging software stack. Prior to version 2025.10.0, an integer overflow occurring in `SdpPacket::parse_header()` allows the current buffer length to be set to 7 after a complete header of size 8 has been read. The remaining length to read is computed using the current length subtracted by the header length which results in a negative value. This value is then interpreted as `SIZE_MAX` (or slightly less) because the expected type of the argument is `size_t`. Depending on whether the server is plain TCP or TLS, this leads to either an infinite loop or a stack buffer overflow. Version 2025.10.0 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/everest/everest-core","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c86cd9c0ada60b5797f574fd484eae4d8330017d"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2025.10.0"}]}}],"versions":["2022.12.0","2022.12.1","2023.1.0","2023.10.0","2023.12.0","2023.2.0","2023.2.1","2023.3.0","2023.5.0","2023.6.0","2023.7.0","2023.8.0","2023.9.0","2023.9.1","2024.1.0","2024.10.0","2024.11.0","2024.2.0","2024.3.0-rc1","2024.4.0","2024.5.0","2024.6.0-rc1","2024.6.0-rc2","2024.7.0","2024.7.1","2024.8.0","2024.9.0-rc1","2025.1.0-rc1","2025.1.0-rc2","2025.2.0","2025.3.0","2025.4.0-rc1","2025.5.0","2025.6.0","2025.7.0","2025.7.0-rc1","2025.8.0","2025.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68137.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["243003712789178062503146303338281965718","28960150712886505085483741986671241515","168243888782963850779708053776925040017","301503089711335497483477796302426921625","266559291961740525977226234582463159260","14112705696940663726721188972121718934","229722161894950827463204315700879441599","171855750029820596888200642603912303410","1847160579080647096042318630878208024"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2025-68137-aed155c7","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/everest/everest-core/commit/c86cd9c0ada60b5797f574fd484eae4d8330017d","target":{"file":"modules/EVSE/Auth/tests/auth_tests.cpp"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"274524476206042087287404301418060636027","length":1807},"id":"CVE-2025-68137-e210278c","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/everest/everest-core/commit/c86cd9c0ada60b5797f574fd484eae4d8330017d","target":{"file":"modules/EVSE/Auth/tests/auth_tests.cpp","function":"TEST_F"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68137.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core/security/advisories/GHSA-7qq4-q9r8-wc7w"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68137"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-120","CWE-835"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68137.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
