{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-21986","published":"2025-04-01T16:15:30Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:20:18.113772Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-21986"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: switchdev: Convert blocking notification chain to a raw one  A blocking notification chain uses a read-write semaphore to protect the integrity of the chain. The semaphore is acquired for writing when adding / removing notifiers to / from the chain and acquired for reading when traversing the chain and informing notifiers about an event.  In case of the blocking switchdev notification chain, recursive notifications are possible which leads to the semaphore being acquired twice for reading and to lockdep warnings being generated [1].  Specifically, this can happen when the bridge driver processes a SWITCHDEV_BRPORT_UNOFFLOADED event which causes it to emit notifications about deferred events when calling switchdev_deferred_process().  Fix this by converting the notification chain to a raw notification chain in a similar fashion to the netdev notification chain. Protect the chain using the RTNL mutex by acquiring it when modifying the chain. Events are always informed under the RTNL mutex, but add an assertion in call_switchdev_blocking_notifiers() to make sure this is not violated in the future.  Maintain the \"blocking\" prefix as events are always emitted from process context and listeners are allowed to block.
