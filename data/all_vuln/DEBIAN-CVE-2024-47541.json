An OOB-write vulnerability has been identified in the gst_ssa_parse_remove_override_codes function of the gstssaparse.c file. This function is responsible for parsing and removing SSA (SubStation Alpha) style override codes, which are enclosed in curly brackets ({}). The issue arises when a closing curly bracket \"}\" appears before an opening curly bracket \"{\" in the input string. In this case, memmove() incorrectly duplicates a substring. With each successive loop iteration, the size passed to memmove() becomes progressively larger (strlen(end+1)), leading to a write beyond the allocated memory bounds. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-base1.0","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gst-plugins-base1.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.18.4-2+deb11u3"}]}],"versions":["1.18.4-2","1.18.4-2+deb11u1","1.18.4-2+deb11u2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47541.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-base1.0","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gst-plugins-base1.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.22.0-3+deb12u3"}]}],"versions":["1.22.0-3","1.22.0-3+deb12u1","1.22.0-3+deb12u2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47541.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-base1.0","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gst-plugins-base1.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.24.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47541.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-base1.0","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gst-plugins-base1.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.24.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47541.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-47541"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
