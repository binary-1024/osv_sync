When `stbi_set_flip_vertically_on_load` is set to `TRUE` and `req_comp` is set to a number that doesn’t match the real number of components per pixel, the library attempts to flip the image vertically. A crafted image file can trigger `memcpy` out-of-bounds read because `bytes_per_pixel` used to calculate `bytes_per_row` doesn’t match the real image array dimensions.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-45662.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"2.28"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-145_GHSL-2023-151_stb_image_h/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/5736b15f7ea0ffb08dd38af21067c314d6a3aae9/stb_image.h#L1235"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NMXKOKPP4BKTNUTF5KSRDQAWOUILQZNO/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QVABVF4GEM6BYD5L4L64RCRSXUHY6LGN/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UVQ7ONFH5GWLMXYEAJG32A3EUKUCEVCR/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L"}]}
