When updating a guest's page table entry, vm_pgoff was improperly used as the offset to get the page's pfn. As vaddr and vm_pgoff are controllable by user-mode processes, this flaw allows unprivileged local users on the host to write outside the userspace region and potentially corrupt the kernel, resulting in a denial of service condition.","references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2069793"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230214-0003/"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/08/4"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
