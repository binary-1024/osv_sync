The fix for this is to call YAML.safe_load on input. This has been tested in all Puppet-supplied MCollective plugins, but there is a chance that third-party plugins could rely on this insecure behavior.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mcollective","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/mcollective@2.6.0+dfsg-2.1?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.6.0+dfsg-2.1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"mcollective","binary_version":"2.6.0+dfsg-2.1"},{"binary_name":"mcollective-client","binary_version":"2.6.0+dfsg-2.1"},{"binary_name":"mcollective-common","binary_version":"2.6.0+dfsg-2.1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2017/UBUNTU-CVE-2017-2292.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mcollective","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/mcollective@2.6.0+dfsg-2.1?arch=source&distro=bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.6.0+dfsg-2.1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"mcollective","binary_version":"2.6.0+dfsg-2.1"},{"binary_name":"mcollective-client","binary_version":"2.6.0+dfsg-2.1"},{"binary_name":"mcollective-common","binary_version":"2.6.0+dfsg-2.1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2017/UBUNTU-CVE-2017-2292.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2017-2292"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://puppet.com/security/cve/cve-2017-2292"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/puppetlabs/marionette-collective/commit/e0e741889f5adeb8f75387037106b0d28a9099b0"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-2292"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
