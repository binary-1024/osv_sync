Its functionality can be enhanced via a plethora of extensions.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn attacker could, via a specially crafted multipart response, execute arbitrary JavaScript under the `resource://pdf.js` origin.  This could allow them to access cross-origin PDF content. This access is limited to &quot;same site&quot; documents by the Site Isolation feature on desktop clients, but full cross-origin access is possible on Android versions.
