If an attacker manages to exhaust the heap space, this error is not detected and may lead to libssh using a partially initialized cipher context. This occurs because the OpenSSL error code returned aliases with the SSH_OK code, resulting in libssh not properly detecting the error returned by the OpenSSL library. This issue can lead to undefined behavior, including compromised data confidentiality and integrity or crashes.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libssh_jll","ecosystem":"Julia","purl":"pkg:julia/libssh_jll?uuid=a8d4f100-aa25-5708-be18-96e0805c2c9d"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.11.3+0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/SecurityAdvisories.jl/tree/generated/osv/2025/JLSEC-2025-332.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-5987"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2376219"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC-BY-4.0","sources":[{"html_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-5987","id":"CVE-2025-5987","imported":"2025-11-29T03:32:16.520Z","modified":"2025-11-28T19:09:30.720Z","published":"2025-07-07T15:15:28.180Z","url":"https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2025-5987"}]}}
