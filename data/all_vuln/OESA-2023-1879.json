  "details": "Qt (pronounced as &quot;cute&quot;, not &quot;cu-tee&quot;) is a cross-platform framework that is usually used as a graphical toolkit, although it is also very helpful in creating CLI applications. It runs on the three major desktop OSes, as well as on mobile OSes, such as Symbian, Nokia Belle, Meego Harmattan, MeeGo or BB10, and on embedded devices. Ports for Android (Necessitas) and iOS are also in development\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nIn Qt before 5.15.15, 6.x before 6.2.9, and 6.3.x through 6.5.x before 6.5.2, there can be an application crash in QXmlStreamReader via a crafted XML string that triggers a situation in which a prefix is greater than a length.(CVE-2023-37369)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Qt before 5.15.15, 6.x before 6.2.10, and 6.3.x through 6.5.x before 6.5.3. There are infinite loops in recursive entity expansion.(CVE-2023-38197)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Qt before 5.15.16, 6.x before 6.2.10, and 6.3.x through 6.5.x before 6.5.3 on Windows. When using the GDI font engine, if a corrupted font is loaded via QFontDatabase::addApplicationFont{FromData], then it can cause the application to crash because of missing length checks.(CVE-2023-43114)",
