The hnd_129540\nfunction, which handles NMEA2000 PGN 129540 (GNSS Satellites in View)\npackets, fails to validate the user-supplied satellite count against the\nsize of the skyview array (184 elements). This allows an attacker to\nwrite beyond the bounds of the array by providing a satellite count up\nto 255, leading to memory corruption, Denial of Service (DoS), and\npotentially arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2025-67268)\nAn integer underflow vulnerability exists in the `nextstate()` function\nin `gpsd/packet.c` of gpsd versions prior to commit\n`ffa1d6f40bca0b035fc7f5e563160ebb67199da7`. When parsing a NAVCOM\npacket, the payload length is calculated using `lexer->length =\n(size_t)c - 4` without checking if the input byte `c` is less than 4.\nThis results in an unsigned integer underflow, setting `lexer->length`\nto a very large value (near `SIZE_MAX`). The parser then enters a loop\nattempting to consume this massive number of bytes, causing 100% CPU\nutilization and a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
