This is related to use of \\f as a marker to denote truncation of a long plaintext line.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gnupg","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gnupg?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.9-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.10-r0","2.0.10-r1","2.0.15-r0","2.0.16-r0","2.0.16-r1","2.0.16-r2","2.0.17-r0","2.0.18-r0","2.0.19-r0","2.0.20-r0","2.0.21-r0","2.0.22-r0","2.0.22-r1","2.1.0-r1","2.1.0_beta751-r1","2.1.0_beta783-r1","2.1.0_beta895-r1","2.1.1-r1","2.1.10-r0","2.1.10-r1","2.1.11-r0","2.1.12-r0","2.1.13-r0","2.1.14-r0","2.1.15-r0","2.1.16-r0","2.1.17-r0","2.1.18-r0","2.1.19-r0","2.1.2-r1","2.1.20-r0","2.1.21-r0","2.1.22-r0","2.1.23-r0","2.1.23-r1","2.1.3-r1","2.1.4-r1","2.1.5-r1","2.1.6-r1","2.1.7-r1","2.1.8-r0","2.1.9-r0","2.1.9-r1","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.2.10-r0","2.2.12-r0","2.2.13-r0","2.2.14-r0","2.2.15-r0","2.2.16-r0","2.2.17-r0","2.2.18-r0","2.2.19-r0","2.2.19-r1","2.2.2-r0","2.2.20-r0","2.2.21-r0","2.2.21-r1","2.2.23-r0","2.2.24-r0","2.2.25-r0","2.2.26-r0","2.2.27-r0","2.2.28-r0","2.2.29-r0","2.2.29-r1","2.2.29-r2","2.2.29-r3","2.2.29-r4","2.2.29-r5","2.2.3-r0","2.2.3-r1","2.2.31-r0","2.2.31-r1","2.2.33-r0","2.2.34-r0","2.2.35-r0","2.2.35-r1","2.2.35-r2","2.2.35-r3","2.2.35-r4","2.2.36-r0","2.2.37-r0","2.2.39-r0","2.2.40-r0","2.2.41-r0","2.2.5-r0","2.2.6-r0","2.2.6-r2","2.2.6-r3","2.2.7-r0","2.2.8-r0","2.2.9-r0","2.2.9-r1","2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.4.1-r0","2.4.1-r1","2.4.2-r0","2.4.3-r0","2.4.3-r1","2.4.4-r0","2.4.5-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-68972.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnupg","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gnupg?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.9-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.10-r0","2.0.10-r1","2.0.15-r0","2.0.16-r0","2.0.16-r1","2.0.16-r2","2.0.17-r0","2.0.18-r0","2.0.19-r0","2.0.20-r0","2.0.21-r0","2.0.22-r0","2.0.22-r1","2.1.0-r1","2.1.0_beta751-r1","2.1.0_beta783-r1","2.1.0_beta895-r1","2.1.1-r1","2.1.10-r0","2.1.10-r1","2.1.11-r0","2.1.12-r0","2.1.13-r0","2.1.14-r0","2.1.15-r0","2.1.16-r0","2.1.17-r0","2.1.18-r0","2.1.19-r0","2.1.2-r1","2.1.20-r0","2.1.21-r0","2.1.22-r0","2.1.23-r0","2.1.23-r1","2.1.3-r1","2.1.4-r1","2.1.5-r1","2.1.6-r1","2.1.7-r1","2.1.8-r0","2.1.9-r0","2.1.9-r1","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.2.10-r0","2.2.12-r0","2.2.13-r0","2.2.14-r0","2.2.15-r0","2.2.16-r0","2.2.17-r0","2.2.18-r0","2.2.19-r0","2.2.19-r1","2.2.2-r0","2.2.20-r0","2.2.21-r0","2.2.21-r1","2.2.23-r0","2.2.24-r0","2.2.25-r0","2.2.26-r0","2.2.27-r0","2.2.28-r0","2.2.29-r0","2.2.29-r1","2.2.29-r2","2.2.29-r3","2.2.29-r4","2.2.29-r5","2.2.3-r0","2.2.3-r1","2.2.31-r0","2.2.31-r1","2.2.33-r0","2.2.34-r0","2.2.35-r0","2.2.35-r1","2.2.35-r2","2.2.35-r3","2.2.35-r4","2.2.36-r0","2.2.37-r0","2.2.39-r0","2.2.40-r0","2.2.41-r0","2.2.5-r0","2.2.6-r0","2.2.6-r2","2.2.6-r3","2.2.7-r0","2.2.8-r0","2.2.9-r0","2.2.9-r1","2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.4.1-r0","2.4.1-r1","2.4.2-r0","2.4.3-r0","2.4.3-r1","2.4.4-r0","2.4.5-r0","2.4.5-r1","2.4.6-r0","2.4.7-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-68972.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnupg","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gnupg?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.9-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.10-r0","2.0.10-r1","2.0.15-r0","2.0.16-r0","2.0.16-r1","2.0.16-r2","2.0.17-r0","2.0.18-r0","2.0.19-r0","2.0.20-r0","2.0.21-r0","2.0.22-r0","2.0.22-r1","2.1.0-r1","2.1.0_beta751-r1","2.1.0_beta783-r1","2.1.0_beta895-r1","2.1.1-r1","2.1.10-r0","2.1.10-r1","2.1.11-r0","2.1.12-r0","2.1.13-r0","2.1.14-r0","2.1.15-r0","2.1.16-r0","2.1.17-r0","2.1.18-r0","2.1.19-r0","2.1.2-r1","2.1.20-r0","2.1.21-r0","2.1.22-r0","2.1.23-r0","2.1.23-r1","2.1.3-r1","2.1.4-r1","2.1.5-r1","2.1.6-r1","2.1.7-r1","2.1.8-r0","2.1.9-r0","2.1.9-r1","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.2.10-r0","2.2.12-r0","2.2.13-r0","2.2.14-r0","2.2.15-r0","2.2.16-r0","2.2.17-r0","2.2.18-r0","2.2.19-r0","2.2.19-r1","2.2.2-r0","2.2.20-r0","2.2.21-r0","2.2.21-r1","2.2.23-r0","2.2.24-r0","2.2.25-r0","2.2.26-r0","2.2.27-r0","2.2.28-r0","2.2.29-r0","2.2.29-r1","2.2.29-r2","2.2.29-r3","2.2.29-r4","2.2.29-r5","2.2.3-r0","2.2.3-r1","2.2.31-r0","2.2.31-r1","2.2.33-r0","2.2.34-r0","2.2.35-r0","2.2.35-r1","2.2.35-r2","2.2.35-r3","2.2.35-r4","2.2.36-r0","2.2.37-r0","2.2.39-r0","2.2.40-r0","2.2.41-r0","2.2.5-r0","2.2.6-r0","2.2.6-r2","2.2.6-r3","2.2.7-r0","2.2.8-r0","2.2.9-r0","2.2.9-r1","2.4.0-r0","2.4.0-r1","2.4.0-r2","2.4.1-r0","2.4.1-r1","2.4.2-r0","2.4.3-r0","2.4.3-r1","2.4.4-r0","2.4.5-r0","2.4.5-r1","2.4.6-r0","2.4.7-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-68972.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnupg","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.23","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gnupg?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.9-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.10-r0","2.0
