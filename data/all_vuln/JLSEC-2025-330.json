From version 1.6.0 to before 1.6.51, an out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in png_image_read_composite when processing palette images with PNG_FLAG_OPTIMIZE_ALPHA enabled. The palette compositing code in png_init_read_transformations incorrectly applies background compositing during premultiplication, violating the invariant component ≤ alpha × 257 required by the simplified PNG API. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.51.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libpng_jll","ecosystem":"Julia","purl":"pkg:julia/libpng_jll?uuid=b53b4c65-9356-5827-b1ea-8c7a1a84506f"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.6.51+0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/SecurityAdvisories.jl/tree/generated/osv/2025/JLSEC-2025-330.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/commit/08da33b4c88cfcd36e5a706558a8d7e0e4773643"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/issues/686"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/pull/751"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/security/advisories/GHSA-hfc7-ph9c-wcww"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC-BY-4.0","sources":[{"html_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64720","id":"CVE-2025-64720","imported":"2025-11-27T03:28:04.931Z","modified":"2025-11-26T18:35:18.253Z","published":"2025-11-25T00:15:47.460Z","url":"https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2025-64720"}]}}
