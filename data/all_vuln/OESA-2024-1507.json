It provides a simple C language application programming interface (API) to access the secure communications protocols as well as APIs to parse and write X.509, PKCS #12, and other required structures. The project strives to provide a secure communications back-end, simple to use and integrated with the rest of the base Linux libraries. A back-end designed to work and be secure out of the box, keeping the complexity of TLS and PKI out of application code.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw has been discovered in GnuTLS where an application crash can be induced when attempting to verify a specially crafted .pem bundle using the &quot;certtool --verify-chain&quot; command.(CVE-2024-28835)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gnutls","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/gnutls&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.2-14.oe2203sp2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["gnutls-devel-3.7.2-14.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","gnutls-debugsource-3.7.2-14.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","gnutls-utils-3.7.2-14.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","gnutls-3.7.2-14.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","gnutls-debuginfo-3.7.2-14.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["gnutls-help-3.7.2-14.oe2203sp2.noarch.rpm"],"src":["gnutls-3.7.2-14.oe2203sp2.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["gnutls-debuginfo-3.7.2-14.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","gnutls-debugsource-3.7.2-14.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","gnutls-utils-3.7.2-14.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","gnutls-3.7.2-14.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","gnutls-devel-3.7.2-14.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-1507.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2024-1507"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28835"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
