  "details": "Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++ (or other languages, depending on the chosen implementation). Python is also usable as an extension language for applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use scripting or automation interfaces.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nDuring an address list folding when a separating comma ends up on a folded line and that line is to be unicode-encoded then the separator itself is also unicode-encoded. Expected behavior is that the separating comma remains a plan comma. This can result in the address header being misinterpreted by some mail servers.(CVE-2025-1795)\n\nThere is an issue in CPython when using `bytes.decode(&quot;unicode_escape&quot;, error=&quot;ignore|replace&quot;)`. If you are not using the &quot;unicode_escape&quot; encoding or an error handler your usage is not affected. To work-around this issue you may stop using the error= handler and instead wrap the bytes.decode() call in a try-except catching the DecodeError.(CVE-2025-4516)\n\nThere is a defect in the CPython &apos;tarfile&apos; module affecting the &apos;TarFile&apos; extraction and entry enumeration APIs. The tar implementation would process tar archives with negative offsets without error, resulting in an infinite loop and deadlock during the parsing of maliciously crafted tar archives.(CVE-2025-8194)",
