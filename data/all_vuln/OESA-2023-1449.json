When performing NTLM authentication, the client replies to cryptographic challenges back to the server. These replies have variable lengths, and Winbind fails to check the lan manager response length. When Winbind is used for NTLM authentication, a maliciously crafted request can trigger an out-of-bounds read in Winbind, possibly resulting in a crash.(CVE-2022-2127)\n\nAn infinite loop vulnerability was found in Samba&apos;s mdssvc RPC service for Spotlight. When parsing Spotlight mdssvc RPC packets sent by the client, the core unmarshalling function sl_unpack_loop() did not validate a field in the network packet that contains the count of elements in an array-like structure. By passing 0 as the count value, the attacked function will run in an endless loop consuming 100% CPU. This flaw allows an attacker to issue a malformed RPC request, triggering an infinite loop, resulting in a denial of service condition.(CVE-2023-34966)\n\nA Type Confusion vulnerability was found in Samba&apos;s mdssvc RPC service for Spotlight. When parsing Spotlight mdssvc RPC packets, one encoded data structure is a key-value style dictionary where the keys are character strings, and the values can be any of the supported types in the mdssvc protocol. Due to a lack of type checking in callers of the dalloc_value_for_key() function, which returns the object associated with a key, a caller may trigger a crash in talloc_get_size() when talloc detects that the passed-in pointer is not a valid talloc pointer. With an RPC worker process shared among multiple client connections, a malicious client or attacker can trigger a process crash in a shared RPC mdssvc worker process, affecting all other clients this worker serves.(CVE-2023-34967)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"samba","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/samba&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.11.12-31.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["samba-dc-provision-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","samba-winbind-krb5-locator-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","samba-client-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-samba-dc-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","samba-krb5-printing-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ctdb-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","samba-common-tools-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","samba-dc-bind-dlz-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","samba-dc-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","samba-devel-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","samba-winbind-clients-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","samba-test-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","samba-libs-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libsmbclient-devel-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libwbclient-devel-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-samba-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","samba-winbind-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","samba-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","samba-debugsource-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","samba-common-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","samba-help-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libwbclient-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libsmbclient-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ctdb-tests-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","samba-winbind-modules-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-samba-test-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","samba-debuginfo-4.11.12-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["samba-pidl-4.11.12-31.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["samba-4.11.12-31.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["ctdb-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-samba-dc-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","samba-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libsmbclient-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","samba-client-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","samba-debugsource-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","samba-dc-provision-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","samba-libs-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","ctdb-tests-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libsmbclient-devel-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","samba-common-tools-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","samba-help-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","samba-winbind-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","samba-winbind-clients-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libwbclient-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","samba-krb5-printing-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libwbclient-devel-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","samba-devel-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","samba-dc-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-samba-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","samba-dc-bind-dlz-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","samba-winbind-modules-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-samba-test-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","samba-common-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","samba-debuginfo-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","samba-test-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","samba-vfs-glusterfs-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","samba-winbind-krb5-locator-4.11.12-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2023-1449.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2023-1449"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2127"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34966"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34967"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
