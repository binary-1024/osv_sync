Any user authenticated within a limited scope (trust/oauth/application credential) can create an EC2 credential with an escalated permission, such as obtaining admin while the user is on a limited viewer role. This potentially allows a malicious user to act as the admin on a project another user has the admin role on, which can effectively grant that user global admin privileges.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"keystone","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/keystone@2:9.3.0-0ubuntu3.2?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2:8.0.0-0ubuntu1","2:9.0.0~b1-0ubuntu1","2:9.0.0~b2-0ubuntu1","2:9.0.0~b3-0ubuntu1","2:9.0.0~rc1-0ubuntu1","2:9.0.0-0ubuntu1","2:9.0.2-0ubuntu1","2:9.0.2-0ubuntu2","2:9.1.0-0ubuntu1","2:9.2.0-0ubuntu1","2:9.3.0-0ubuntu1","2:9.3.0-0ubuntu2","2:9.3.0-0ubuntu3","2:9.3.0-0ubuntu3.1","2:9.3.0-0ubuntu3.2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"keystone","binary_version":"2:9.3.0-0ubuntu3.2"},{"binary_name":"python-keystone","binary_version":"2:9.3.0-0ubuntu3.2"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2020/UBUNTU-CVE-2020-12689.json"}},{"package":{"name":"keystone","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/keystone@2:13.0.4-0ubuntu1?arch=source&distro=bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2:13.0.4-0ubuntu1"}]}],"versions":["2:12.0.0-0ubuntu1","2:13.0.0~b1-0ubuntu1","2:13.0.0~b2-0ubuntu1","2:13.0.0~b3-0ubuntu1","2:13.0.0~rc1-0ubuntu1","2:13.0.0~rc2-0ubuntu1","2:13.0.0-0ubuntu1","2:13.0.1-0ubuntu1","2:13.0.2-0ubuntu1","2:13.0.2-0ubuntu3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"keystone","binary_version":"2:13.0.4-0ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"python-keystone","binary_version":"2:13.0.4-0ubuntu1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2020/UBUNTU-CVE-2020-12689.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-12689"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/05/06/5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4480-1"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-12689"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
