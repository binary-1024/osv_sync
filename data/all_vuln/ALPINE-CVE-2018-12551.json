{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2018-12551","published":"2019-03-27T18:29:00.367Z","modified":"2025-11-19T06:13:38.005221Z","upstream":["CVE-2018-12551"],"details":"When Eclipse Mosquitto version 1.0 to 1.5.5 (inclusive) is configured to use a password file for authentication, any malformed data in the password file will be treated as valid. This typically means that the malformed data becomes a username and no password. If this occurs, clients can circumvent authentication and get access to the broker by using the malformed username. In particular, a blank line will be treated as a valid empty username. Other security measures are unaffected. Users who have only used the mosquitto_passwd utility to create and modify their password files are unaffected by this vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mosquitto","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mosquitto?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.6-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.2-r0","1.2.2-r1","1.2.3-r0","1.3-r0","1.3-r1","1.3.1-r0","1.3.2-r0","1.3.4-r0","1.4-r0","1.4-r1","1.4.1-r0","1.4.1-r1","1.4.10-r0","1.4.10-r1","1.4.10-r2","1.4.10-r3","1.4.11-r0","1.4.11-r1","1.4.12-r0","1.4.13-r0","1.4.14-r0","1.4.14-r1","1.4.14-r2","1.4.14-r3","1.4.14-r4","1.4.14-r5","1.4.15-r0","1.4.15-r1","1.4.15-r2","1.4.15-r3","1.4.15-r4","1.4.2-r0","1.4.2-r1","1.4.3-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.4.8-r0","1.4.8-r1","1.4.8-r2","1.4.9-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.3-r0","1.5.3-r1","1.5.4-r0","1.5.5-r0","1.5.5-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-12551.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mosquitto","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mosquitto?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.6-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.2-r0","1.2.2-r1","1.2.3-r0","1.3-r0","1.3-r1","1.3.1-r0","1.3.2-r0","1.3.4-r0","1.4-r0","1.4-r1","1.4.1-r0","1.4.1-r1","1.4.10-r0","1.4.10-r1","1.4.10-r2","1.4.10-r3","1.4.11-r0","1.4.11-r1","1.4.12-r0","1.4.13-r0","1.4.14-r0","1.4.14-r1","1.4.14-r2","1.4.14-r3","1.4.14-r4","1.4.14-r5","1.4.15-r0","1.4.15-r1","1.4.15-r2","1.4.15-r3","1.4.15-r4","1.4.2-r0","1.4.2-r1","1.4.3-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.4.8-r0","1.4.8-r1","1.4.8-r2","1.4.9-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.3-r0","1.5.3-r1","1.5.4-r0","1.5.5-r0","1.5.5-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-12551.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mosquitto","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mosquitto?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.6-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.2-r0","1.2.2-r1","1.2.3-r0","1.3-r0","1.3-r1","1.3.1-r0","1.3.2-r0","1.3.4-r0","1.4-r0","1.4-r1","1.4.1-r0","1.4.1-r1","1.4.10-r0","1.4.10-r1","1.4.10-r2","1.4.10-r3","1.4.11-r0","1.4.11-r1","1.4.12-r0","1.4.13-r0","1.4.14-r0","1.4.14-r1","1.4.14-r2","1.4.14-r3","1.4.14-r4","1.4.14-r5","1.4.15-r0","1.4.15-r1","1.4.15-r2","1.4.15-r3","1.4.15-r4","1.4.2-r0","1.4.2-r1","1.4.3-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.4.8-r0","1.4.8-r1","1.4.8-r2","1.4.9-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.3-r0","1.5.3-r1","1.5.4-r0","1.5.5-r0","1.5.5-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-12551.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mosquitto","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mosquitto?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.6-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.2-r0","1.2.2-r1","1.2.3-r0","1.3-r0","1.3-r1","1.3.1-r0","1.3.2-r0","1.3.4-r0","1.4-r0","1.4-r1","1.4.1-r0","1.4.1-r1","1.4.10-r0","1.4.10-r1","1.4.10-r2","1.4.10-r3","1.4.11-r0","1.4.11-r1","1.4.12-r0","1.4.13-r0","1.4.14-r0","1.4.14-r1","1.4.14-r2","1.4.14-r3","1.4.14-r4","1.4.14-r5","1.4.15-r0","1.4.15-r1","1.4.15-r2","1.4.15-r3","1.4.15-r4","1.4.2-r0","1.4.2-r1","1.4.3-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.4.8-r0","1.4.8-r1","1.4.8-r2","1.4.9-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.3-r0","1.5.3-r1","1.5.4-r0","1.5.5-r0","1.5.5-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-12551.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mosquitto","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mosquitto?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.6-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.2-r0","1.2.2-r1","1.2.3-r0","1.3-r0","1.3-r1","1.3.1-r0","1.3.2-r0","1.3.4-r0","1.4-r0","1.4-r1","1.4.1-r0","1.4.1-r1","1.4.10-r0","1.4.10-r1","1.4.10-r2","1.4.10-r3","1.4.11-r0","1.4.11-r1","1.4.12-r0","1.4.13-r0","1.4.14-r0","1.4.14-r1","1.4.14-r2","1.4.14-r3","1.4.14-r4","1.4.14-r5","1.4.15-r0","1.4.15-r1","1.4.15-r2","1.4.15-r3","1.4.15-r4","1.4.2-r0","1.4.2-r1","1.4.3-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.4.8-r0","1.4.8-r1","1.4.8-r2","1.4.9-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.3-r0","1.5.3-r1","1.5.4-r0","1.5.5-r0","1.5.5-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-12551.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mosquitto","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mosquitto?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.6-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.2-r0","1.2.2-r1","1.2.3-r0","1.3-r0","1.3-r1","1.3.1-r0","1.3.2-r0","1.3.4-r0","1.4-r0","1.4-r1","1.4.1-r0","1.4.1-r1","1.4.10-r0","1.4.10-r1","1.4.10-r2","1.4.10-r3","1.4.11-r0","1.4.11-r1","1.4.12-r0","1.4.13-r0","1.4.14-r0","1.4.14-r1","1.4.14-r2","1.4.14-r3","1.4.14-r4","1.4.14-r5","1.4.15-r0","1.4.15-r1","1.4.15-r2","1.4.15-r3","1.4.15-r4","1.4.2-r0","1.4.2-r1","1.4.3-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.4.8-r0","1.4.8-r1","1.4.8-r2","1.4.9-r0","1.5.1-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.3-r0","1.5.3-r1","1.5.4-r0","1.5.5-r0","1.5.5-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conv
