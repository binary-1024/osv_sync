rt_del_uncached_list()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndst: fix races in rt6_uncached_list_del() and rt_del_uncached_list()\n\nsyzbot was able to crash the kernel in rt6_uncached_list_flush_dev()\nin an interesting way [1]\n\nCrash happens in list_del_init()/INIT_LIST_HEAD() while writing\nlist->prev, while the prior write on list->next went well.\n\nstatic inline void INIT_LIST_HEAD(struct list_head *list)\n{\n\tWRITE_ONCE(list->next, list); // This went well\n\tWRITE_ONCE(list->prev, list); // Crash, @list has been freed.\n}\n\nIssue here is that rt6_uncached_list_del() did not attempt to lock\nul->lock, as list_empty(&rt->dst.rt_uncached) returned\ntrue because the WRITE_ONCE(list->next, list) happened on the other CPU.\n\nWe might use list_del_init_careful() and list_empty_careful(),\nor make sure rt6_uncached_list_del() always grabs the spinlock\nwhenever rt->dst.rt_uncached_list has been set.\n\nA similar fix is neeed for IPv4.\n\n[1]\n\n BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in INIT_LIST_HEAD include/linux/list.h:46 [inline]\n BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in list_del_init include/linux/list.h:296 [inline]\n BUG:
