The size limit for that cache database can be configured using the `max-cache-size` statement in the configuration file; it defaults to 90% of the total amount of memory available on the host. When the size of the cache reaches 7/8 of the configured limit, a cache-cleaning algorithm starts to remove expired and/or least-recently used RRsets from the cache, to keep memory use below the configured limit.\r\n\r\nIt has been discovered that the effectiveness of the cache-cleaning algorithm used in `named` can be severely diminished by querying the resolver for specific RRsets in a certain order, effectively allowing the configured `max-cache-size` limit to be significantly exceeded.\nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.11.0 through 9.16.41, 9.18.0 through 9.18.15, 9.19.0 through 9.19.13, 9.11.3-S1 through 9.16.41-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.15-S1.(CVE-2023-2828)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"bind","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/bind&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["bind-pkcs11-devel-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","bind-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","bind-libs-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","bind-debuginfo-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","bind-chroot-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-utils-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","bind-utils-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","bind-dnssec-utils-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","bind-devel-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","bind-debugsource-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-libs-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["bind-license-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.noarch.rpm","python3-bind-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.noarch.rpm","bind-dnssec-doc-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.noarch.rpm"],"src":["bind-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["bind-utils-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","bind-chroot-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","bind-debuginfo-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-libs-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","bind-libs-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-devel-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","bind-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-utils-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","bind-devel-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","bind-debugsource-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","bind-dnssec-utils-9.16.23-18.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2023-1505.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2023-1505"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-2828"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
