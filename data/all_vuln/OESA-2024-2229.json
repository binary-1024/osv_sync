The primary goal is to provide an API to which software developers may code and be assured of predictable if not identical behaviour regardless of the platform on which their software is built, relieving them of the need to code special-case conditions to work around or take advantage of platform-specific deficiencies or features.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nLax permissions set by the Apache Portable Runtime library on Unix platforms would allow local users read access to named shared memory segments, potentially revealing sensitive application data. \r\n\r\nThis issue does not affect non-Unix platforms, or builds with APR_USE_SHMEM_SHMGET=1 (apr.h)\r\n\r\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to APR version 1.7.5, which fixes this issue.(CVE-2023-49582)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"apr","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/apr&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.7.4-4.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["apr-1.7.4-4.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","apr-debuginfo-1.7.4-4.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","apr-debugsource-1.7.4-4.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","apr-devel-1.7.4-4.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["apr-help-1.7.4-4.oe2403.noarch.rpm"],"src":["apr-1.7.4-4.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["apr-1.7.4-4.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","apr-debuginfo-1.7.4-4.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","apr-debugsource-1.7.4-4.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","apr-devel-1.7.4-4.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-2229.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2024-2229"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49582"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
