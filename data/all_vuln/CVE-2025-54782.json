In versions 0.2.0 and below, a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability was discovered in the @nestjs/devtools-integration package. When enabled, the package exposes a local development HTTP server with an API endpoint that uses an unsafe JavaScript sandbox (safe-eval-like implementation). Due to improper sandboxing and missing cross-origin protections, any malicious website visited by a developer can execute arbitrary code on their local machine. The package adds HTTP endpoints to a locally running NestJS development server. One of these endpoints, /inspector/graph/interact, accepts JSON input containing a code field and executes the provided code in a Node.js vm.runInNewContext sandbox. This is fixed in version 0.2.1.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54782.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.2.1"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nestjs/nest/security/advisories/GHSA-85cg-cmq5-qjm7"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://socket.dev/blog/nestjs-rce-vuln"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/nestjs-devtools-integration-rce-poc"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/nestjs-typescript-starter-w-devtools-integration"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H"}]}
