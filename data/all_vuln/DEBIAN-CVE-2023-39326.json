A malicious HTTP client can further exploit this to cause a server to automatically read a large amount of data (up to about 1GiB) when a handler fails to read the entire body of a request. Chunk extensions are a little-used HTTP feature which permit including additional metadata in a request or response body sent using the chunked encoding. The net/http chunked encoding reader discards this metadata. A sender can exploit this by inserting a large metadata segment with each byte transferred. The chunk reader now produces an error if the ratio of real body to encoded bytes grows too small.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"golang-1.15","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-1.15?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.15.15-1","1.15.15-1~deb11u1","1.15.15-1~deb11u2","1.15.15-1~deb11u3","1.15.15-1~deb11u4","1.15.15-2","1.15.15-3","1.15.15-4","1.15.15-5","1.15.9-6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-39326.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-1.19","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-1.19?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.19.10-1","1.19.10-2","1.19.11-1","1.19.12-1","1.19.12-2","1.19.12-2~bpo11+1","1.19.12-2~bpo12+1","1.19.13-1","1.19.13-1~bpo11+1","1.19.13-1~bpo12+1","1.19.8-2","1.19.9-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-39326.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-39326"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
