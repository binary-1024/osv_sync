An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 versions 0.28.5 and earlier. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service by crashing Exiv2, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. The bug is fixed in version 0.28.6.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"exiv2","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/exiv2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.27.3-3","0.27.3-3+deb11u1","0.27.3-3+deb11u2","0.27.3-3.1","0.27.5-1","0.27.5-2","0.27.5-3","0.27.5-4","0.27.6-1","0.28.0+dfsg-1","0.28.0+dfsg-2","0.28.0+dfsg-3","0.28.0+dfsg-4","0.28.1+dfsg-1","0.28.1+dfsg-2","0.28.1+dfsg-3","0.28.2+dfsg-1","0.28.3+dfsg-1","0.28.3+dfsg-2","0.28.4+dfsg-1","0.28.4+dfsg-2","0.28.5+dfsg-1","0.28.7+dfsg-1","0.28.7+dfsg-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-54080.json"}},{"package":{"name":"exiv2","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/exiv2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.27.6-1","0.28.0+dfsg-1","0.28.0+dfsg-2","0.28.0+dfsg-3","0.28.0+dfsg-4","0.28.1+dfsg-1","0.28.1+dfsg-2","0.28.1+dfsg-3","0.28.2+dfsg-1","0.28.3+dfsg-1","0.28.3+dfsg-2","0.28.4+dfsg-1","0.28.4+dfsg-2","0.28.5+dfsg-1","0.28.7+dfsg-1","0.28.7+dfsg-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-54080.json"}},{"package":{"name":"exiv2","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/exiv2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.28.5+dfsg-1","0.28.7+dfsg-1","0.28.7+dfsg-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-54080.json"}},{"package":{"name":"exiv2","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/exiv2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.28.7+dfsg-2"}]}],"versions":["0.28.5+dfsg-1","0.28.7+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-54080.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-54080"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
