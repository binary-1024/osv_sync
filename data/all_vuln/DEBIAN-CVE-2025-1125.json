{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-1125","published":"2025-03-03T15:15:16Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:20:10.805417Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-1125"],"details":"When reading data from a hfs filesystem, grub's hfs filesystem module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem metadata to calculate the internal buffers size, however it misses to properly check for integer overflows. A maliciouly crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculation to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result the hfsplus_open_compressed_real() function will write past of the internal buffer length. This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grub's internal critical data and may result in arbitrary code execution by-passing secure boot protections.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"grub2","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/grub2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.04-20","2.06-1","2.06-10","2.06-11","2.06-12","2.06-13","2.06-13+hurd.1","2.06-13+hurd.2","2.06-14","2.06-2","2.06-2+hurd.1","2.06-2+hurd.2","2.06-2+hurd.3","2.06-2+hurd.4","2.06-2+hurd.5","2.06-2+hurd.6","2.06-2+hurd.7","2.06-2+hurd.8","2.06-3","2.06-3~deb10u1","2.06-3~deb10u2","2.06-3~deb10u3","2.06-3~deb10u4","2.06-3~deb11u1","2.06-3~deb11u2","2.06-3~deb11u4","2.06-3~deb11u5","2.06-3~deb11u6","2.06-4","2.06-4+hurd.1","2.06-5","2.06-6","2.06-7","2.06-8","2.06-8+hurd.1","2.06-8.1","2.06-9","2.12-1","2.12-1.1","2.12-1~bpo12+1","2.12-2","2.12-2~deb13u1","2.12-3","2.12-4","2.12-5","2.12-5+hurd.1","2.12-6","2.12-7","2.12-8","2.12-9","2.12-9+hurd.1","2.12~rc1-1","2.12~rc1-10","2.12~rc1-11","2.12~rc1-12","2.12~rc1-13","2.12~rc1-2","2.12~rc1-3","2.12~rc1-6","2.12~rc1-7","2.12~rc1-8","2.12~rc1-9","2.14~git20250718.0e36779-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-1125.json"}},{"package":{"name":"grub2","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/grub2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.06-13","2.06-13+deb12u1","2.06-13+hurd.1","2.06-13+hurd.2","2.06-14","2.12-1","2.12-1.1","2.12-1~bpo12+1","2.12-2","2.12-2~deb13u1","2.12-3","2.12-4","2.12-5","2.12-5+hurd.1","2.12-6","2.12-7","2.12-8","2.12-9","2.12-9+hurd.1","2.12~rc1-1","2.12~rc1-10","2.12~rc1-11","2.12~rc1-12","2.12~rc1-13","2.12~rc1-2","2.12~rc1-3","2.12~rc1-6","2.12~rc1-7","2.12~rc1-8","2.12~rc1-9","2.14~git20250718.0e36779-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-1125.json"}},{"package":{"name":"grub2","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/grub2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.12-6"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-1125.json"}},{"package":{"name":"grub2","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/grub2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.12-6"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-1125.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-1125"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
