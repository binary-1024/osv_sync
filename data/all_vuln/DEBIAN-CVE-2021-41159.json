All FreeRDP clients prior to version 2.4.1 using gateway connections (`/gt:rpc`) fail to validate input data. A malicious gateway might allow client memory to be written out of bounds. This issue has been resolved in version 2.4.1. If you are unable to update then use `/gt:http` rather than /gt:rdp connections if possible or use a direct connection without a gateway.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"freerdp2","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/freerdp2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.10.0+dfsg1-1","2.10.0+dfsg1-1.1","2.10.0+dfsg1-1~bpo11+1","2.11.2+dfsg1-1","2.11.2+dfsg1-1.1~exp1","2.11.2+dfsg1-1.1~exp2","2.11.5+dfsg1-1","2.11.7+dfsg1-1","2.11.7+dfsg1-2","2.11.7+dfsg1-3","2.11.7+dfsg1-4","2.11.7+dfsg1-5","2.11.7+dfsg1-6","2.3.0+dfsg1-2","2.3.0+dfsg1-2+deb11u1","2.3.0+dfsg1-2+deb11u2","2.3.0+dfsg1-2+deb11u3","2.4.1+dfsg1-1","2.5.0+dfsg1-1","2.6.0+dfsg1-1","2.6.1+dfsg1-1","2.6.1+dfsg1-2","2.6.1+dfsg1-3","2.6.1+dfsg1-3~bpo11+1","2.7.0+dfsg1-1","2.7.0+dfsg1-1~bpo11+1","2.8.0+dfsg1-1","2.8.1+dfsg1-1","2.8.1+dfsg1-1~bpo11+1","2.9.0+dfsg1-1","2.9.0+dfsg1-1~bpo11+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-41159.json"}},{"package":{"name":"freerdp2","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/freerdp2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.1+dfsg1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-41159.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-41159"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
