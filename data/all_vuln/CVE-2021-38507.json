However, if a second encrypted port on the same IP address (e.g. port 8443) did not opt-in to opportunistic encryption; a network attacker could forward a connection from the browser to port 443 to port 8443, causing the browser to treat the content of port 8443 as same-origin with HTTP. This was resolved by disabling the Opportunistic Encryption feature, which had low usage. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.","references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1730935"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/12/msg00030.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/01/msg00001.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202202-03"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-14"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5026"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5034"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2021-48/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2021-49/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2021-50/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
