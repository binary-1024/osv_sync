{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-jp3q-wwp3-pwv9","published":"2026-01-22T21:41:14Z","modified":"2026-01-22T21:48:16.201503Z","summary":"Freeform Craft Plugin CP UI (builder/integrations) has Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue","details":"**Summary**\nAn authenticated, low-privilege user (able to create/edit forms) can inject arbitrary HTML/JS into the Craft Control Panel (CP) builder and integrations views. User-controlled form labels and integration metadata are rendered with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization, leading to stored XSS that executes when any admin views the builder/integration screens.\n\n**Affected Product**\n- Ecosystem: Packagist (Craft CMS plugin)\n- Package: solspace/craft-freeform\n- Version: <= 5.14.6 (latest observed). Likely all 5.x until patched.\n\n**Details**\n- Root cause: Multiple user-controlled strings (field labels, section labels, integration icons, short names, WYSIWYG previews) are injected into React components using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization.\n- Evidence: `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` on user-controlled properties in bundled CP JS at [packages/plugin/src/Resources/js/client/client.js](packages/plugin/src/Resources/js/client/client.js#L1).\n\n**PoCs**\n- Label-based XSS:\n  1. In Craft CP, create/edit a Freeform field and set its label to `<img src=x onerror=\"alert('xss-label')\">`.\n  2. Open the form builder view containing the field.\n  3. Alert executes (stored XSS).\n- Integration icon SVG:\n  1. Set an integration \"icon SVG\" to `<svg><script>alert('xss-icon')</script></svg>`.\n  2. Open the integrations CP view.\n  3. Script executes.\n\n**Impact**\nArbitrary JS in admin CP; session/CSRF token theft; potential full admin takeover via DOM-driven actions.\n\n**Remediation**\n- Sanitize/HTML-encode all user-controlled strings before passing to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, or avoid it for labels/titles/icons.\n- Server-side: strip/escape disallowed tags on save for fields, integration metadata, WYSIWYG content.\n- Add regression tests with `<img onerror>` payloads to ensure no execution in builder/integration views.\n\n**Workarounds**\n- Restrict form-edit permissions to trusted admins only until patched.\n- Consider CSP that disallows inline scripts (defense-in-depth only).\n\n**Credits**\n- Discovered by https://www.linkedin.com/in/praveenkavinda/ | Prav33N-Sec.\n\n**Disclosure / CVE Request**\n- Request CVE for this confirmed stored XSS.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"solspace/craft-freeform","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/solspace/craft-freeform"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.14.7"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0","2.0.0-beta.1","2.0.0-beta.10","2.0.0-beta.11","2.0.0-beta.12","2.0.0-beta.13","2.0.0-beta.14","2.0.0-beta.15","2.0.0-beta.16","2.0.0-beta.17","2.0.0-beta.18","2.0.0-beta.19","2.0.0-beta.2","2.0.0-beta.20","2.0.0-beta.3","2.0.0-beta.4","2.0.0-beta.5","2.0.0-beta.6","2.0.0-beta.7","2.0.0-beta.8","2.0.0-beta.9","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.3.2","2.3.3","2.3.4","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.4.2","2.4.3","2.5.0","2.5.1","2.5.10","2.5.11","2.5.12","2.5.13","2.5.14","2.5.15","2.5.16","2.5.17","2.5.18","2.5.19","2.5.2","2.5.20","2.5.21","2.5.22","2.5.23","2.5.24","2.5.25","2.5.26","2.5.27","2.5.3","2.5.4","2.5.5","2.5.6","2.5.7","2.5.8","2.5.9","3.0.0","3.0.0-beta.1","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.0.5","3.0.6","3.1.0","3.10.0","3.10.0-beta.1","3.10.0-beta.2","3.10.0-beta.3","3.10.0-beta.4","3.10.0-beta.5","3.10.0-beta.6","3.10.1","3.10.10","3.10.11","3.10.2","3.10.2.1","3.10.3","3.10.4","3.10.5","3.10.6","3.10.7","3.10.8","3.10.9","3.11.0","3.11.0-beta.1","3.11.0-beta.2","3.11.0-beta.3","3.11.0-beta.4","3.11.0-beta.5","3.11.0-beta.6","3.11.1","3.11.10","3.11.11","3.11.11.1","3.11.12","3.11.13","3.11.13.1","3.11.2","3.11.3","3.11.4","3.11.4.1","3.11.5","3.11.6","3.11.7","3.11.8","3.11.9","3.12.0","3.12.0-beta.10","3.12.0-beta.3","3.12.0-beta.4","3.12.0-beta.5","3.12.0-beta.6","3.12.0-beta.7","3.12.0-beta.8","3.12.0-beta.9","3.12.1","3.12.10","3.12.11","3.12.12","3.12.12.1","3.12.13","3.12.2","3.12.3","3.12.4","3.12.5","3.12.6","3.12.7","3.12.8","3.12.9","3.12.9.1","3.13.0","3.13.1","3.13.10","3.13.11","3.13.12","3.13.13","3.13.14","3.13.15","3.13.16","3.13.17","3.13.18","3.13.19","3.13.2","3.13.20","3.13.21","3.13.22","3.13.22.1","3.13.23","3.13.24","3.13.25","3.13.26","3.13.27","3.13.28","3.13.29","3.13.3","3.13.30","3.13.31","3.13.32","3.13.33","3.13.34","3.13.35","3.13.36","3.13.37","3.13.38","3.13.4","3.13.5","3.13.5.1","3.13.6","3.13.7","3.13.8","3.13.9","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.2.3","3.2.4","3.2.5","3.3.0","3.3.1","3.3.2","3.3.3","3.4.0","3.4.1","3.5.0","3.5.1","3.5.10","3.5.2","3.5.3","3.5.4","3.5.5","3.5.6","3.5.7","3.5.8","3.5.9","3.6.0","3.6.1","3.6.10","3.6.11","3.6.12","3.6.2","3.6.3","3.6.4","3.6.5","3.6.6","3.6.7","3.6.8","3.6.9","3.7.0","3.7.1","3.7.2","3.7.3","3.7.4","3.7.5","3.8.0","3.8.1","3.8.2","3.8.3","3.8.4","3.9.0","3.9.1","3.9.10","3.9.11","3.9.2","3.9.3","3.9.4","3.9.5","3.9.6","3.9.7","3.9.8","3.9.9","4.0.0","4.0.0-beta.1","4.0.0-beta.10","4.0.0-beta.11","4.0.0-beta.12","4.0.0-beta.13","4.0.0-beta.14","4.0.0-beta.15","4.0.0-beta.15.1","4.0.0-beta.16","4.0.0-beta.17","4.0.0-beta.18","4.0.0-beta.2","4.0.0-beta.3","4.0.0-beta.4","4.0.0-beta.5","4.0.0-beta.6","4.0.0-beta.7","4.0.0-beta.8","4.0.0-beta.9","4.0.1","4.0.10","4.0.11","4.0.12","4.0.13","4.0.14","4.0.15","4.0.16","4.0.17","4.0.18","4.0.19","4.0.2","4.0.20","4.0.21","4.0.22","4.0.23","4.0.24","4.0.24.1","4.0.25","4.0.26","4.0.3","4.0.4","4.0.5","4.0.6","4.0.7","4.0.8","4.0.9","4.1.0","4.1.1","4.1.10","4.1.11","4.1.12","4.1.12.1","4.1.13","4.1.14","4.1.15","4.1.15.1","4.1.16","4.1.17","4.1.18","4.1.19","4.1.2","4.1.20","4.1.21","4.1.22","4.1.23","4.1.24","4.1.25","4.1.26","4.1.27","4.1.28","4.1.29","4.1.3","4.1.30","4.1.4","4.1.5","4.1.6","4.1.7","4.1.8","4.1.9","5.0.0","5.0.0-beta.1","5.0.0-beta.10","5.0.0-beta.11","5.0.0-beta.12","5.0.0-beta.13","5.0.0-beta.14","5.0.0-beta.15","5.0.0-beta.16","5.0.0-beta.17","5.0.0-beta.2","5.0.0-beta.3","5.0.0-beta.4","5.0.0-beta.5","5.0.0-beta.6","5.0.0-beta.7","5.0.0-beta.8","5.0.0-beta.9","5.0.1","5.0.10","5.0.11","5.0.12","5.0.13","5.0.14","5.0.14.1","5.0.15","5.0.16","5.0.2","5.0.3","5.0.4","5.0.5","5.0.6","5.0.6.1","5.0.7","5.0.8","5.0.9","5.1.0","5.1.1","5.1.10","5.1.11","5.1.12","5.1.13","5.1.13.1","5.1.14","5.1.15","5.1.16","5.1.16.1","5.1.17","5.1.18","5.1.18.1","5.1.19","5.1.19.1","5.1.2","5.1.3","5.1.4","5.1.5","5.1.5.1","5.1.6","5.1.7","5.1.8","5.1.9","5.10.0","5.10.1","5.10.10","5.10.11","5.10.12","5.10.13","5.10.14","5.10.15","5.10.15.1","5.10.16","5.10.16.1","5.10.17","5.10.17.1","5.10.2","5.10.3","5.10.4","5.10.5","5.10.6","5.10.7","5.10.8","5.10.9","5.11.0","5.11.1","5.11.10","5.11.11","5.11.12","5.11.13","5.11.14","5.11.16","5.11.17","5.11.2","5.11.3","5.11.4","5.11.5","5.11.6","5.11.7","5.11.8","5.11.9","5.12.0","5.12.1","5.12.2","5.12.3","5.12.4","5.13.0","5.13.1","5.13.2","5.13.3","5.13.4","5.13.5","5.13.6","5.13.7","5.13.8","5.14.0","5.14.1","5.14.2","5.14.3","5.14.4","5.14.5","5.14.6","5.2.0","5.2.1","5.2.2","5.3.0","5.3.1","5.3.2","5.3.3","5.3.3.1","5.3.4","5.3.5","5.4.0","5.4.1","5.4.2","5.5.0","5.5.1","5.5.10","5.5.2","5.5.3","5.5.4","5.5.5","5.5.6","5.5.7","5.5.8","5.5.9","5.6.0","5.6.1","5.6.2","5.6.3","5.6.4","5.6.5","5.6.6","5.6.7","5.6.8","5.7.0","5.7.0.1","5.7.1","5.7.2","5.7.3","
