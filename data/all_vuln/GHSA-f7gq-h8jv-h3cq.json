After upgrading, users must update their AuthController implementation to use the new `clear_session/2` function with their OTP app name. You will be prompted to do so with a compile-time error.\n\nIf you do not have the setting `require_token_presence_for_authentication?` set to `true` in the `tokens` section, you will see a separate error:\n\n```\n** (Spark.Error.DslError) authentication -> session_identifier:\nMust set `authentication.session_identifier` to either `:jti` or `:unsafe`.\n\n...\n```\n\nIn order to revoke sessions on log out when not storing tokens directly in the session, we must have some unique identifier with which to do so. You should prefer to enable `require_token_presence_for_authentication?` if possible, instead of setting this to `:jti`. Note that whatever you do here, if you did not previously have `require_token_presence_for_authentication?` set to `true`, setting it to `true` *or* setting `authentication.session_identifier` to `:jti` will log out all of your currently authenticated users.\n\n### Workarounds\nYou can manually revoke tokens in your `logout/2` handler in your auth controller.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ash_authentication_phoenix","ecosystem":"Hex","purl":"pkg:hex/ash_authentication_phoenix"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.10.0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.1","1.1.0","1.2.0","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.4.3","1.4.4","1.4.5","1.4.6","1.4.7","1.4.8","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.6.3","1.6.4","1.6.5","1.6.6","1.7.0","1.7.1","1.7.2","1.7.3","1.8.0","1.8.1","1.8.2","1.8.3","1.8.4","1.8.5","1.8.6","1.8.7","1.9.0","1.9.1","1.9.2","1.9.3","1.9.4","2.0.0","2.0.0-rc.0","2.0.0-rc.1","2.0.0-rc.2","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.10","2.1.11","2.1.2","2.1.3","2.1.4","2.1.5","2.1.6","2.1.7","2.1.8","2.1.9","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.3.0","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.4.2","2.4.3","2.4.4","2.4.5","2.4.6","2.4.7","2.4.8","2.5.0","2.5.1","2.5.2","2.5.3","2.5.4","2.6.0","2.6.1","2.6.2","2.6.3","2.7.0","2.8.0","2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 2.9.0","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/06/GHSA-f7gq-h8jv-h3cq/GHSA-f7gq-h8jv-h3cq.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication_phoenix/security/advisories/GHSA-f7gq-h8jv-h3cq"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4754"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication_phoenix/pull/634"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication_phoenix/commit/a3253fb4fc7145aeb403537af1c24d3a8d51ffb1"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication_phoenix"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-613"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-06-17T14:20:46Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-06-17T15:15:53Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
