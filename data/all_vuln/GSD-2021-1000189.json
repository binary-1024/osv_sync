  "details": "The Freenode IRC Network, specifically freenode hosts, DNS name, etc. (\"freenode ltd\"), was sold to a third party, Andrew Lee. Recent operational changes have resulted in the majority (possibly all) of staff resigning and leaving due to concerns around data leakage and potential denial of service in the form of \"you can ban your enemies\"  via line being offered to at least one individual (who refused it). The Freenode staff have formed a new IRC network called \"libera.chat\" (https://libera.chat/) that is effectively a replacement of Freenode.",
