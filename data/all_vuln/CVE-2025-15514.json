{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-15514","published":"2026-01-12T23:15:51.957Z","modified":"2026-01-23T05:50:34.946241Z","details":"Ollama 0.11.5-rc0 through current version 0.13.5 contain a null pointer dereference vulnerability in the multi-modal model image processing functionality. When processing base64-encoded image data via the /api/chat endpoint, the application fails to validate that the decoded data represents valid media before passing it to the mtmd_helper_bitmap_init_from_buf function. This function can return NULL for malformed input, but the code does not check this return value before dereferencing the pointer in subsequent operations. A remote attacker can exploit this by sending specially crafted base64 image data that decodes to invalid media, causing a segmentation fault and crashing the runner process. This results in a denial of service condition where the model becomes unavailable to all users until the service is restarted.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ollama/ollama","events":[{"last_affected":"6eaf194b8540bdec2b96eafcf98481f4400bdf1e"},{"introduced":"6de62664d957a9b6606b39330af701b5f4a24035"},{"last_affected":"7325791599409de52534429897481918717a9e85"},{"last_affected":"d5a0d8d904baaf66a5326463a409fe4fa09b2dd2"},{"last_affected":"d925b5350c75a66e7830e00f53b243084395821f"},{"last_affected":"f804e8a46005b36e6f14577f4226cf2046abce12"}]}],"versions":["v0.11.6","v0.11.6-rc0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-15514.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://https://github.com/ollama/ollama"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://ollama.com/"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/172df98b-07cd-41ea-a628-366f8cd525c0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/ollama-multi-modal-image-processing-null-pointer-dereference"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
