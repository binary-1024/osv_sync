All versions contain an non-exhaustive URL scheme check that does not protect against XSS. User-controlled URLs pass through src/utils/validation.ts, but the check only strips `javascript:` and a few patterns. `data:` URLs (for example data:image/svg+xml,…) still pass. If a sanitized value is used in href/src, an attacker can execute a script. There is currently no fix for this issue.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-58361.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":">= 0"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/MarceloTessaro/promptcraft-forge-studio/security/advisories/GHSA-fjch-4g87-g4p4"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
