Prior to versions 2.2.20, 3.1.18, and 3.2.3, `Rack::Request#POST` reads the entire request body into memory for `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, calling `rack.input.read(nil)` without enforcing a length or cap. Large request bodies can therefore be buffered completely into process memory before parsing, leading to denial of service (DoS) through memory exhaustion. Users should upgrade to Rack version 2.2.20, 3.1.18, or 3.2.3, anu of which enforces form parameter limits using `query_parser.bytesize_limit`, preventing unbounded reads of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies. Additionally, enforce strict maximum body size at the proxy or web server layer (e.g., Nginx `client_max_body_size`, Apache `LimitRequestBody`).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ruby-rack","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ruby-rack?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.1.4-3+deb11u4"}]}],"versions":["2.1.4-3","2.1.4-3+deb11u1","2.1.4-3+deb11u2","2.1.4-3+deb11u3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-61919.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ruby-rack","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ruby-rack?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.2.20-0+deb12u1"}]}],"versions":["2.2.13-1~deb12u1","2.2.6.4-1","2.2.6.4-1+deb12u1","2.2.7-1","2.2.7-1.1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-61919.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ruby-rack","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ruby-rack?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.18-1~deb13u1"}]}],"versions":["3.1.16-0.1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-61919.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ruby-rack","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ruby-rack?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.18-1"}]}],"versions":["3.1.16-0.1","3.1.18-1~deb13u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-61919.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-61919"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
