  "details": "This kernel-linus update is based on upstream 5.15.120 and fixes atleast\nthe following security issues:\n\nA flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel DECnet networking\nprotocol was found. A remote user could use this flaw to crash the\nsystem. This is fixed by removing DECnet support (CVE-2023-3338).\n\nA use-after-free vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's netfilter\nsubsystem in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c. Mishandled error handling with\nNFT_MSG_NEWRULE makes it possible to use a dangling pointer in the same\ntransaction causing a use-after-free vulnerability. This flaw allows a\nlocal attacker with user access to cause a privilege escalation issue\n(CVE-2023-3390).\n\nNOTE!!\nThis kernel also contains a fix for dkms builds hanging / stalling during\nupgrade to Mageia 9 (mga#31982) due to the new make 4.4 series utility\nending up in a loop processing Makefile in kernel-devel packages.\nSo if you use dkms packaged drivers and kernel-linus, you need to be\nrunning this kernel (or any later released ones) before you do an online\nupgrade to avoid the upgrade stalling / hanging.\n\nFor other upstream fixes in this update, see the referenced changelogs.\n",
