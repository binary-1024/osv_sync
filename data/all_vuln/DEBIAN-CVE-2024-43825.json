  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: Fix the sorting functionality in iio_gts_build_avail_time_table  The sorting in iio_gts_build_avail_time_table is not working as intended. It could result in an out-of-bounds access when the time is zero.  Here are more details:  1. When the gts->itime_table[i].time_us is zero, e.g., the time sequence is `3, 0, 1`, the inner for-loop will not terminate and do out-of-bound writes. This is because once `times[j] > new`, the value `new` will be added in the current position and the `times[j]` will be moved to `j+1` position, which makes the if-condition always hold. Meanwhile, idx will be added one, making the loop keep running without termination and out-of-bound write. 2. If none of the gts->itime_table[i].time_us is zero, the elements will just be copied without being sorted as described in the comment \"Sort times from all tables to one and remove duplicates\".  For more details, please refer to https://lore.kernel.org/all/6dd0d822-046c-4dd2-9532-79d7ab96ec05@gmail.com.",
