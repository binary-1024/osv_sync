When ufshcd is removed in ufshcd_remove(), RTC work is not cancelled. Due to this, any further trigger of the RTC work after ufshcd_remove() would result in a NULL pointer dereference as below:  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000002a4 Workqueue: events ufshcd_rtc_work Call trace:  _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x34/0x8c  pm_runtime_get_if_active+0x24/0xb4  ufshcd_rtc_work+0x124/0x19c  process_scheduled_works+0x18c/0x2d8  worker_thread+0x144/0x280  kthread+0x11c/0x128  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20  Since RTC work accesses the ufshcd internal structures, it should be cancelled when ufshcd is removed. So do that in ufshcd_remove(), as per the order in ufshcd_init().","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-56621.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-56621.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-56621"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
