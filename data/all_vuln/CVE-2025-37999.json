  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/erofs/fileio: call erofs_onlinefolio_split() after bio_add_folio()\n\nIf bio_add_folio() fails (because it is full),\nerofs_fileio_scan_folio() needs to submit the I/O request via\nerofs_fileio_rq_submit() and allocate a new I/O request with an empty\n`struct bio`.  Then it retries the bio_add_folio() call.\n\nHowever, at this point, erofs_onlinefolio_split() has already been\ncalled which increments `folio->private`; the retry will call\nerofs_onlinefolio_split() again, but there will never be a matching\nerofs_onlinefolio_end() call.  This leaves the folio locked forever\nand all waiters will be stuck in folio_wait_bit_common().\n\nThis bug has been added by commit ce63cb62d794 (\"erofs: support\nunencoded inodes for fileio\"), but was practically unreachable because\nthere was room for 256 folios in the `struct bio` - until commit\n9f74ae8c9ac9 (\"erofs: shorten bvecs[] for file-backed mounts\") which\nreduced the array capacity to 16 folios.\n\nIt was now trivial to trigger the bug by manually invoking readahead\nfrom userspace, e.g.:\n\n posix_fadvise(fd, 0, st.st_size, POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED);\n\nThis should be fixed by invoking erofs_onlinefolio_split() only after\nbio_add_folio() has succeeded.  This is safe: asynchronous completions\ninvoking erofs_onlinefolio_end() will not unlock the folio because\nerofs_fileio_scan_folio() is still holding a reference to be released\nby erofs_onlinefolio_end() at the end.",
