A signature forgery vulnerability exists in the SM2 signature verification logic of sm-crypto prior to version 0.4.0. Under default configurations, an attacker can forge valid signatures for arbitrary public keys. If the message space contains sufficient redundancy, the attacker can fix the prefix of the message associated with the forged signature to satisfy specific formatting requirements. Version 0.4.0 patches the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/juneandgreen/sm-crypto","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"85295a859d0766222d12ce2be3e6fce7b438b510"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23965.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23965.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/JuneAndGreen/sm-crypto/commit/85295a859d0766222d12ce2be3e6fce7b438b510"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/JuneAndGreen/sm-crypto/security/advisories/GHSA-hpwg-xg7m-3p6m"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23965"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-347"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23965.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
