  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: rtw89: chan: fix soft lockup in rtw89_entity_recalc_mgnt_roles()  During rtw89_entity_recalc_mgnt_roles(), there is a normalizing process which will re-order the list if an entry with target pattern is found. And once one is found, should have aborted the list_for_each_entry. But, `break` just aborted the inner for-loop. The outer list_for_each_entry still continues. Normally, only the first entry will match the target pattern, and the re-ordering will change nothing, so there won't be soft lockup. However, in some special cases, soft lockup would happen.  Fix it by `goto fill` to break from the list_for_each_entry.  The following is a sample of kernel log for this problem.  watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#1 stuck for 26s! [wpa_supplicant:2055] [...] RIP: 0010:rtw89_entity_recalc ([...] chan.c:392 chan.c:479) rtw89_core [...]",
