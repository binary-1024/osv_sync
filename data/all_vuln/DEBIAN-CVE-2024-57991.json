And once one is found, should have aborted the list_for_each_entry. But, `break` just aborted the inner for-loop. The outer list_for_each_entry still continues. Normally, only the first entry will match the target pattern, and the re-ordering will change nothing, so there won't be soft lockup. However, in some special cases, soft lockup would happen.  Fix it by `goto fill` to break from the list_for_each_entry.  The following is a sample of kernel log for this problem.  watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#1 stuck for 26s!
