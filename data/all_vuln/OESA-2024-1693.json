possibly could give\nfalse positives.\r\n\r\nThere has been attempts to make page_is_pfmemalloc() more robust,\nbut not using it in the first place in this context is probably better,\nremoving cpu cycles.\r\n\r\nNote to stable teams :\r\n\r\nYou need to backport 84ce071e38a6 (&quot;net: introduce\n__skb_fill_page_desc_noacc&quot;) as a prereq.\r\n\r\nRace is more probable after commit c07aea3ef4d4\n(&quot;mm: add a signature in struct page&quot;) because page_is_pfmemalloc()\nis now using low order bit from page-&gt;lru.next, which can change\nmore often than page-&gt;index.\r\n\r\nLow order bit should never be set for lru.next (when used as an anchor\nin LRU list), so KCSAN report is mostly a false positive.\r\n\r\nBackporting to older kernel versions

The safest fix would be to completely\ndisallow sending io_uring files via sockets via SCM_RIGHT, so there\nare no possible cycles invloving registered files and thus rendering\nSCM accounting on the io_uring side unnecessary.(CVE-2023-52654)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nusb: aqc111: check packet for fixup for true limit\r\n\r\nIf a device sends a packet that is inbetween 0\nand sizeof(u64) the value passed to skb_trim()\nas length will wrap around ending up as some very\nlarge value.\r\n\r\nThe driver will then proceed to parse the header\nlocated at that position, which will either oops or\nprocess some random value.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to check against sizeof(u64) rather than\n0, which the driver currently does. The issue exists\nsince the introduction of the driver.(CVE-2023-52655)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\ncrypto: s390/aes - Fix buffer overread in CTR mode\r\n\r\nWhen processing the last block, the s390 ctr code will always read\na whole block, even if there isn&apos;t a whole block of data left.

If the timing is\nright, function do_qc can add pending quota changes to a transaction,\nthen later, another call to do_qc can negate those changes, resulting\nin a net gain of 0. The quota_change information is recorded in the qc\nbuffer (and qd element of the inode as well). The buffer is added to the\ntransaction by the first call to do_qc, but a subsequent call changes\nthe value from non-zero back to zero. At that point it&apos;s too late to\nremove the buffer_head from the transaction. Later, when the quota sync\ncode is called, the zero-change qd element is discovered and flagged as\nan assert warning. If the fs is mounted with errors=panic, the kernel\nwill panic.\r\n\r\nThis is usually seen when files are truncated and the quota changes are\nnegated by punch_hole/truncate which uses gfs2_quota_hold and\ngfs2_quota_unhold rather than block allocations that use gfs2_quota_lock\nand gfs2_quota_unlock which automatically do quota sync.\r\n\r\nThis patch solves the problem by adding a check to qd_check_sync such\nthat net-zero quota changes already added to the transaction are no\nlonger deemed necessary to be synced, and skipped.\r\n\r\nIn this case references are taken for the qd and the slot from do_qc\nso those need to be put. The normal sequence of events for a normal\nnon-zero quota change is as follows:\r\n\r\ngfs2_quota_change\n   do_qc\n      qd_hold\n      slot_hold\r\n\r\nLater, when the changes are to be synced:\r\n\r\ngfs2_quota_sync\n   qd_fish\n      qd_check_sync\n         gets qd ref via lockref_get_not_dead\n   do_sync\n      do_qc(QC_SYNC)\n         qd_put\n\t    lockref_put_or_lock\n   qd_unlock\n      qd_put\n         lockref_put_or_lock\r\n\r\nIn the net-zero change case, we add a check to qd_check_sync so it puts\nthe qd and slot references acquired in gfs2_quota_change and skip the\nunneeded sync.(CVE-2023-52759)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\ns390/dasd: protect device queue against concurrent access\r\n\r\nIn dasd_profile_start() the amount of requests on the device queue are\ncounted. The access to the device queue is unprotected against\nconcurrent access. With a lot of parallel I/O, especially with alias\ndevices enabled, the device queue can change while dasd_profile_start()\nis accessing the queue. In the worst case this leads to a kernel panic\ndue to incorrect pointer accesses.\r\n\r\nFix this by taking the device lock before accessing the queue and\ncounting the requests.

When quota groups (squota or qgroups)\nare enabled, this reserves qgroup metadata of type PREALLOC. Once the\noperation is associated to a transaction, we convert PREALLOC to\nPERTRANS, which gets cleared in bulk at the end of the transaction.\r\n\r\nHowever, the error paths of these three operations were not implementing\nthis lifecycle correctly. They unconditionally converted the PREALLOC to\nPERTRANS in a generic cleanup step regardless of errors or whether the\noperation was fully associated to a transaction or not. This resulted in\nerror paths occasionally converting this rsv to PERTRANS without calling\nrecord_root_in_trans successfully, which meant that unless that root got\nrecorded in the transaction by some other thread, the end of the\ntransaction would not free that root&apos;s PERTRANS, leaking it. Ultimately,\nthis resulted in hitting a WARN in CONFIG_BTRFS_DEBUG builds at unmount\nfor the leaked reservation.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to ensure that every qgroup PREALLOC reservation observes the\nfollowing properties:\r\n\r\n1. any failure before record_root_in_trans is called successfully\n   results in freeing the PREALLOC reservation.\n2. after record_root_in_trans, we convert to PERTRANS, and now the\n   transaction owns freeing the reservation.\r\n\r\nThis patch enforces those properties on the three operations.
