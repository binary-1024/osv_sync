The vulnerability is reachable if CONFIG_IPVLAN is enabled.\n\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 90cbed5247439a966b645b34eb0a2e037836ea8e.\n\n(CVE-2023-3090)\n\nA use-after-free flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel when processing named and anonymous sets in batch requests, which can lead to performing arbitrary reads and writes in kernel memory. This flaw allows a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2023-3117)\n\nLinux Kernel nftables Use-After-Free Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability; `nft_chain_lookup_byid()` failed to check whether a chain was active and CAP_NET_ADMIN is in any user or network namespace(CVE-2023-31248)\n\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.1-rc8. dpu_crtc_atomic_check in drivers/gpu/drm/msm/disp/dpu1/dpu_crtc.c lacks check of the return value of kzalloc() and will cause the NULL Pointer Dereference.(CVE-2023-3220)\n\nA flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel DECnet networking protocol was found. A remote user could use this flaw to crash the system.(CVE-2023-3338)\n\nA null pointer dereference was found in the Linux kernel&apos;s Integrated Sensor Hub (ISH) driver.
