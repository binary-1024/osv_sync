A critical File Upload vulnerability in versions prior to 1.5.0, with Social Engineering, allows authenticated users to deploy phishing attacks. By uploading a malicious HTML file disguised as a profile picture, an attacker can create a convincing login page replica that steals user credentials. When a victim visits the uploaded file URL, they see an authentic-looking \"Session Expired\" message prompting them to re-authenticate. All entered credentials are captured and sent to the attacker's server, enabling Account Takeover. Version 1.5.0 patches the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/horilla-opensource/horilla","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a66f8b7ff4c49f39688f24485d228a295f640076"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.1.0","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.3","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.4.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24010.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24010.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/horilla-opensource/horilla/releases/tag/1.5.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/horilla-opensource/horilla/security/advisories/GHSA-5jfv-gw8w-49h3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24010"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-474","CWE-74"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24010.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
