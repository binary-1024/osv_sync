The Yii framework team denies responsibility for this (placing the onus on application developers) and hence has not (and seemingly will not) provide a fix at the framework level. Hence, I am reporting this to Craft as I found it to affect the latest (`5.6.0`) version of Craft CMS.\n\nLeveraging a legitimate but maliciously crafted Yii `Behavior` class, it’s possible to trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Reflection when the tainted `Behavior` is attached to a Yii `Component`, and an event is also fired on the tainted `Component`.\n\n### Details\nThis vulnerability is inspired by `CVE-2024-4990` but differs because a legitimate Yii `Behavior` class is used to abuse the magic `__set()` and `__get()` methods to trigger an arbitrary PHP callable, ultimately leading to RCE. As such, this bypasses the mitigations implemented for `CVE-2024-4990` and the related `CVE-2024-58136`.\n\nUsing the `as <behavior>` syntax in JSON POST input, it’s possible to [attach](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/concept-behaviors#attaching-behaviors) `Behavior` classes to Yii `Components`, which was the crux of the vulnerability identified in `CVE-2024-4990`. Fixes for that vulnerability and the related `CVE-2024-58136` ensured that only classes of type `Behavior` could be attached to a `Component`. Craft CMS also implemented additional logic to prevent arbitrary `Behavior` classes from being attached to the vulnerable `Component`.\n\nA new vulnerability has been identified that bypasses the fixes for the previous vulnerabilities by using a legitimate but specially crafted `Behavior` class, namely the `yii\\behaviors\\AttributeTypecastBehavior`. Attaching a `Behavior` of this type allows the attacker to define an arbitrary callable that is triggered if any event is fired on the tainted `Component`.\n\nUsing a [wildcard](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/concept-events#wildcard-events) event listener (specified as `on *` in JSON input) allows the attacker to catch any event called on the tainted `Component` and redirect the flow of control to call `self::beforeSave` of the `AttributeTypecastBehavior`, triggering the attacker-defined callable and resulting in RCE.\n\nSee the commented payload below:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"as xxx\": {\n    \"__class\": \"yii\\\\behaviors\\\\AttributeTypecastBehavior\",\n    \"__construct()\": [\n      {\n        \"attributeTypes\": {\n          \"typecastBeforeSave\": [\"Psy\\\\Readline\\\\Hoa\\\\ConsoleProcessus\", \"execute\"] // Attacker defined callable\n        },\n        \"typecastBeforeSave\": \"touch /tmp/touch\" // Argument for the callable\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"on *\": \"self::beforeSave\" // When any event is fired on the Component, call beforeSave() of the AttributeTypecastBehavior to trigger the attacker-defined callable with the argument above\n}\n```\n\nThis was found to affect two separate controllers/routes in Craft CMS admin functionality, though others may be affected:\n* /index.php?p=admin%2Factions%2Ffields%2Fapply-layout-element-settings\n* /index.php?p=admin%2Factions%2Ffields%2Frender-card-preview\n\n### PoC\n* Install Craft CMS via Composer:\n```\n$ composer create-project \"craftcms/craft\" app\n```\n* Use the built-in server to launch Craft CMS:\n```\n$ ./craft serve 127.0.0.1:9090\n```\n* The following HTTP traces show the payload used to trigger the vulnerability on each of the vulnerable routes:\n\n**/index.php?p=admin%2Factions%2Ffields%2Fapply-layout-element-settings**\n\n```\nPOST
