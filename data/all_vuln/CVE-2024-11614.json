  "details": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in DPDK's Vhost library checksum offload feature. This issue enables an untrusted or compromised guest to crash the hypervisor's vSwitch by forging Virtio descriptors to cause out-of-bounds reads. This flaw allows an attacker with a malicious VM using a virtio driver to cause the vhost-user side to crash by sending a packet with a Tx checksum offload request and an invalid csum_start offset.",
