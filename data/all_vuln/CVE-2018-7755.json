The floppy driver will copy a kernel pointer to user memory in response to the FDGETPRM ioctl. An attacker can send the FDGETPRM ioctl and use the obtained kernel pointer to discover the location of kernel code and data and bypass kernel security protections such as KASLR.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2029"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2043"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/3/7/1116"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3695-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3695-2/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3696-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3696-2/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3697-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3697-2/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3698-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3698-2/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4308"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/10/msg00003.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
