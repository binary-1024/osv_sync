{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68332","published":"2025-12-22T17:16:00.910Z","modified":"2026-01-10T14:07:54.429030Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-68332"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  comedi: c6xdigio: Fix invalid PNP driver unregistration  The Comedi low-level driver \"c6xdigio\" seems to be for a parallel port connected device.  When the Comedi core calls the driver's Comedi \"attach\" handler `c6xdigio_attach()` to configure a Comedi to use this driver, it tries to enable the parallel port PNP resources by registering a PNP driver with `pnp_register_driver()`, but ignores the return value.  (The `struct pnp_driver` it uses has only the `name` and `id_table` members filled in.)  The driver's Comedi \"detach\" handler `c6xdigio_detach()` unconditionally unregisters the PNP driver with `pnp_unregister_driver()`.  It is possible for `c6xdigio_attach()` to return an error before it calls `pnp_register_driver()` and it is possible for the call to `pnp_register_driver()` to return an error (that is ignored).  In both cases, the driver should not be calling `pnp_unregister_driver()` as it does in `c6xdigio_detach()`.  (Note that `c6xdigio_detach()` will be called by the Comedi core if `c6xdigio_attach()` returns an error, or if the Comedi core decides to detach the Comedi device from the driver for some other reason.)  The unconditional call to `pnp_unregister_driver()` without a previous successful call to `pnp_register_driver()` will cause `driver_unregister()` to issue a warning \"Unexpected driver unregister!\".  This was detected by Syzbot [1].  Also, the PNP driver registration and unregistration should be done at module init and exit time, respectively, not when attaching or detaching Comedi devices to the driver.  (There might be more than one Comedi device being attached to the driver, although that is unlikely.)  Change the driver to do the PNP driver registration at module init time, and the unregistration at module exit time.  Since `c6xdigio_detach()` now only calls `comedi_legacy_detach()`, remove the function and change the Comedi driver \"detach\" handler to `comedi_legacy_detach`.  ------------------------------------------- [1] Syzbot sample crash report: Unexpected driver unregister!
