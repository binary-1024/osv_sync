If an attacker manages to exhaust the heap space, this error is not detected and may lead to libssh using a partially initialized cipher context. This occurs because the OpenSSL error code returned aliases with the SSH_OK code, resulting in libssh not properly detecting the error returned by the OpenSSL library. This issue can lead to undefined behavior, including compromised data confidentiality and integrity or crashes.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libssh?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.10.6-0+deb12u2"}]}],"versions":["0.10.5-2","0.10.5-3","0.10.5-3+hurd.1","0.10.6-0+deb12u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-5987.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libssh?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.11.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-5987.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libssh?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.11.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-5987.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-5987"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
