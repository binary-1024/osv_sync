The RPC server deserialization code allocates memory for arrays before the non-negative length check is performed by the C API entry points. Passing a negative length to the g_new0 function results in a crash due to the negative length being treated as a huge positive number. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon to crash.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2560"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3253"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240517-0009/"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2270115"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-2494"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.libvirt.org/archives/list/devel@lists.libvirt.org/thread/BKRQXPLPC6B7FLHJXSBQYW7HNDEBW6RJ/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/04/msg00000.html"}]}
