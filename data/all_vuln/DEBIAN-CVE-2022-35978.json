In **single player**, a mod can set a global setting that controls the Lua script loaded to display the main menu. The script is then loaded as soon as the game session is exited. The Lua environment the menu runs in is not sandboxed and can directly interfere with the user's system. There are currently no known workarounds.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"minetest","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/minetest?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.3.0+repack-2.1","5.3.0+repack-2.1+deb11u1","5.4.1+repack-1","5.4.1+repack-2","5.5.0+dfsg+~1.9.0mt4+dfsg-1","5.5.0+dfsg+~1.9.0mt4+dfsg-2","5.6.0+dfsg+~1.9.0mt7+dfsg-1","5.6.0+dfsg+~1.9.0mt7+dfsg-2","5.6.0+dfsg+~1.9.0mt7+dfsg-3","5.6.0+dfsg+~1.9.0mt7+dfsg-3~exp1","5.6.0+dfsg+~1.9.0mt7+dfsg-3~exp2","5.6.0+dfsg+~1.9.0mt7+dfsg-3~exp3","5.6.1+dfsg+~1.9.0mt8+dfsg-1","5.6.1+dfsg+~1.9.0mt8+dfsg-2","5.6.1+dfsg+~1.9.0mt8+dfsg-3","5.6.1+dfsg+~1.9.0mt8+dfsg-4","5.8.0+dfsg+~1.9.0mt13-1","5.8.0+dfsg+~1.9.0mt13-1~exp1","5.8.0+dfsg+~1.9.0mt13-1~exp2","5.8.0+dfsg+~1.9.0mt13-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-35978.json"}},{"package":{"name":"minetest","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/minetest?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.5.0+dfsg+~1.9.0mt4+dfsg-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-35978.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-35978"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
