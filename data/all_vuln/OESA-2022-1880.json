  "details": "The Linux Kernel, the operating system core itself.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA race condition in perf_event_open() which can be exploited by an unprivileged user to gain root privileges. The bug allows to build several exploit primitives such as kernel address information leak, arbitrary execution, etc.(CVE-2022-1729)\n\nA use-after-free flaw was found in nf_tables cross-table in the net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c function in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local, privileged attacker to cause a use-after-free problem at the time of table deletion, possibly leading to local privilege escalation.(CVE-2022-2586)\n\nDm-verity is used for extending root-of-trust to root filesystems. LoadPin builds on this property to restrict module/firmware loads to just the trusted root filesystem. Device-mapper table reloads currently allow users with root privileges to switch out the target with an equivalent dm-linear target and bypass verification till reboot. This allows root to bypass LoadPin and can be used to load untrusted and unverified kernel modules and firmware, which implies arbitrary kernel execution and persistence for peripherals that do not verify firmware updates. We recommend upgrading past commit 4caae58406f8ceb741603eee460d79bacca9b1b5(CVE-2022-2503)\n\nAn out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the Linux kernel\u2019s TeleTYpe subsystem. The issue occurs in how a user triggers a race condition using ioctls TIOCSPTLCK and TIOCGPTPEER and TIOCSTI and TCXONC with leakage of memory in the flush_to_ldisc function. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or read unauthorized random data from memory.(CVE-2022-1462)",
