  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs/ntfs3: cancle set bad inode after removing name fails  The reproducer uses a file0 on a ntfs3 file system with a corrupted i_link. When renaming, the file0's inode is marked as a bad inode because the file name cannot be deleted.  The underlying bug is that make_bad_inode() is called on a live inode. In some cases it's \"icache lookup finds a normal inode, d_splice_alias() is called to attach it to dentry, while another thread decides to call make_bad_inode() on it - that would evict it from icache, but we'd already found it there earlier\". In some it's outright \"we have an inode attached to dentry - that's how we got it in the first place; let's call make_bad_inode() on it just for shits and giggles\".",
