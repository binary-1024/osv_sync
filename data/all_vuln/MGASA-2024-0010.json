When destination constraints are specified\nduring addition of PKCS#11-hosted private keys, these constraints are\nonly applied to the first key, even if a PKCS#11 token returns multiple\nkeys. (CVE-2023-51384)\nIn ssh in OpenSSH before 9.6, OS command injection might occur if a user\nname or host name has shell metacharacters, and this name is referenced\nby an expansion token in certain situations. For example, an untrusted\nGit repository can have a submodule with shell metacharacters in a user\nname or host name. (CVE-2023-51385)\n",
