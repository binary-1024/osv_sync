{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50626","published":"2025-12-08T02:15:48.653Z","modified":"2025-12-08T11:06:35.379491Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-50626"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: dvb-usb: fix memory leak in dvb_usb_adapter_init()  Syzbot reports a memory leak in \"dvb_usb_adapter_init()\". The leak is due to not accounting for and freeing current iteration's adapter->priv in case of an error. Currently if an error occurs, it will exit before incrementing \"num_adapters_initalized\", which is used as a reference counter to free all adap->priv in \"dvb_usb_adapter_exit()\". There are multiple error paths that can exit from before incrementing the counter. Including the error handling paths for \"dvb_usb_adapter_stream_init()\", \"dvb_usb_adapter_dvb_init()\" and \"dvb_usb_adapter_frontend_init()\" within \"dvb_usb_adapter_init()\".  This means that in case of an error in any of these functions the current iteration is not accounted for and the current iteration's adap->priv is not freed.  Fix this by freeing the current iteration's adap->priv in the \"stream_init_err:\" label in the error path. The rest of the (accounted for) adap->priv objects are freed in dvb_usb_adapter_exit() as expected using the num_adapters_initalized variable.
