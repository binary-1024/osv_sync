{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-38703","published":"2023-10-06T14:15:12Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:16:08.164686Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-38703"],"details":"PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C with high level API in C, C++, Java, C#, and Python languages. SRTP is a higher level media transport which is stacked upon a lower level media transport such as UDP and ICE. Currently a higher level transport is not synchronized with its lower level transport that may introduce use-after-free issue. This vulnerability affects applications that have SRTP capability (`PJMEDIA_HAS_SRTP` is set) and use underlying media transport other than UDP. This vulnerability’s impact may range from unexpected application termination to control flow hijack/memory corruption. The patch is available as a commit in the master branch.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"asterisk","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/asterisk?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb11u4"}]}],"versions":["1:16.16.1~dfsg+~2.10-1","1:16.16.1~dfsg+~2.10-2","1:16.16.1~dfsg-1","1:16.16.1~dfsg-1+deb11u1","1:16.16.1~dfsg-1+deb11u1~bpo10+1","1:16.16.1~dfsg-2","1:16.16.1~dfsg-3","1:16.16.1~dfsg-4","1:16.23.0~dfsg+~2.10-1","1:16.23.0~dfsg+~cs6.10.20220309-1","1:16.23.0~dfsg+~cs6.10.20220309-2","1:16.23.0~dfsg+~cs6.10.40431411-1","1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb11u1","1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb11u2","1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb11u3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-38703.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ring","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ring?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["20210112.2.b757bac~ds1-1","20210112.2.b757bac~ds1-1+deb11u1","20210112.2.b757bac~ds1-2","20230206.0~ds1-1","20230206.0~ds1-2","20230206.0~ds1-3","20230206.0~ds1-4","20230206.0~ds1-4.1","20230206.0~ds1-4.2","20230206.0~ds1-5","20230206.0~ds1-6","20230206.0~ds2-1","20230206.0~ds2-1.1","20230206.0~ds2-1.2","20230206.0~ds2-1.3","20230922.0~ds1-1","20230922.0~ds2-1","20231201.0~ds1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-38703.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ring","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ring?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["20230206.0~ds2-1.1","20230206.0~ds2-1.1+deb12u1","20230206.0~ds2-1.2","20230206.0~ds2-1.3","20230922.0~ds1-1","20230922.0~ds2-1","20231201.0~ds1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-38703.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-38703"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
