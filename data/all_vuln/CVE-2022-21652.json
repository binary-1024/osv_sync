In affected versions shopware would not invalidate a user session in the event of a password change. With version 5.7.7 the session validation was adjusted, so that sessions created prior to the latest password change of a customer account can't be used to login with said account. This also means, that upon a password change, all existing sessions for a given customer account are automatically considered invalid. There is no workaround for this issue.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-21652.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"5.7.3"},{"fixed":"5.7.7"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/shopware/shopware/security/advisories/GHSA-p523-jrph-qjc6"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/shopware/shopware/commit/47ebd126a94f4b019b6fde64c0df3d18d74ef7d0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-5-en/securityupdates/security-update-01-2022"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
