  "details": "The implementation of ACL inheritance in the Samba AD DC was not\ncomplete, and so absent a 'full-sync' replication, ACLs could get out of\nsync between domain controllers (CVE-2019-14902).\n\nWhen processing untrusted string input Samba can read past the end of\nthe allocated buffer when printing a \"Conversion error\" message to the\nlogs. This can cause a crash after the failed character conversion when\noperating at log level 3 or above (CVE-2019-14907).\n\nDuring DNS zone scavenging (of expired dynamic entries) in a Samba AD\nDC, there is a read of memory after it has been freed (CVE-2019-19344).\n\nNote that manual intervention is required to fully implement the fix\nfor CVE-2019-14902.  See the upstream advisory for details.\n",
