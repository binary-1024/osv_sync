It is particularly suited for very high traffic web sites and powers quite a number of the world&apos;s most visited ones.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn information leak vulnerability was discovered in HAProxy 2.1, 2.2 before 2.2.27, 2.3, 2.4 before 2.4.21, 2.5 before 2.5.11, 2.6 before 2.6.8, 2.7 before 2.7.1. There are 5 bytes left uninitialized in the connection buffer when encoding the FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST record. Sensitive data may be disclosed to configured FastCGI backends in an unexpected way.(CVE-2023-0836)\r\n\r\nHAProxy before 2.8.2 accepts # as part of the URI component, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information or have unspecified other impact upon misinterpretation of a path_end rule, such as routing index.html#.png to a static server.(CVE-2023-45539)",
