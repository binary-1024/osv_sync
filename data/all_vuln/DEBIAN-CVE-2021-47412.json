  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: don't call rq_qos_ops->done_bio if the bio isn't tracked  rq_qos framework is only applied on request based driver, so:  1) rq_qos_done_bio() needn't to be called for bio based driver  2) rq_qos_done_bio() needn't to be called for bio which isn't tracked, such as bios ended from error handling code.  Especially in bio_endio():  1) request queue is referred via bio->bi_bdev->bd_disk->queue, which may be gone since request queue refcount may not be held in above two cases  2) q->rq_qos may be freed in blk_cleanup_queue() when calling into __rq_qos_done_bio()  Fix the potential kernel panic by not calling rq_qos_ops->done_bio if the bio isn't tracked. This way is safe because both ioc_rqos_done_bio() and blkcg_iolatency_done_bio() are nop if the bio isn't tracked.",
