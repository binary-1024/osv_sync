  "details": "This is Varnish Cache, a web application accelerator also known as a caching HTTP reverse proxy. You install it in front of any server that speaks HTTP and configure it to cache the contents. Varnish Cache is really, really fast. It typically speeds up delivery with a factor of 300 - 1000x, depending on your architecture.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in Varnish. The Varnish Cache, with HTTP/2 enabled, allows request smuggling and VCL authorization bypass via a large Content-Length header for a POST request. As a result, this flaw allows the information on the Varnish cache to be poisoned. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.(CVE-2021-36740)",
