  "details": "### Impact\nNpm users of PUC 1.17.3 or PUC latest were briefly affected by crypto-related malware detailed in the blog post below. This includes the extremely popular jsdelivr hosting of this file. \n\n### Patches\nWe unpublished the version on npm.\n\n### Workarounds\nThis has already been unpublished. See Prebid.js 9 release notes for suggestions on moving off the deprecated workflow of using the PUC or pointing to a dynamic version of it. PUC users pointing to latest should transition to 1.17.2 ASAP to avoid similar attacks in the future.\n\n### References\nhttps://www.sonatype.com/blog/npm-chalk-and-debug-packages-hit-in-software-supply-chain-attack",
