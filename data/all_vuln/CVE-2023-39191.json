The issue occurs due to a lack of proper validation of dynamic pointers within user-supplied eBPF programs prior to executing them. This may allow an attacker with CAP_BPF privileges to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:6583"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0381"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0439"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0448"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-39191"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2226783"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-CAN-19399/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
