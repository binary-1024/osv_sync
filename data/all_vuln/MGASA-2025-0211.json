  "details": "Updated redis packages to a more recent version to fix security\nvulnerabilities:\nSome vulnerabilities have been discovered and fixed.\nPlease note this update is from 7.0 to 7.2 which brings some potentially\nbreaking changes. In most cases this update could be installed without\nproblems.\nPotentially Breaking / Behavior Changes:\n* Client side tracking for scripts now tracks the keys that are read by\n  the script instead of the keys that are declared by the caller of EVAL /\n  FCALL (#11770)\n* Freeze time sampling during command execution and in scripts (#10300)\n* When a blocked command is being unblocked, checks like ACL, OOM, etc\n  are re-evaluated (#11012)\n* Unify ACL failure error message text and error codes (#11160)\n* Blocked stream command that's released when key no longer exists\n  carries a different error code (#11012)\n* Command stats are updated for blocked commands only when / if the\n  command actually executes (#11012)\n* The way ACL users are stored internally no longer removes redundant\n  command and category rules, which may alter the way those rules are\n  displayed as part of `ACL SAVE`, `ACL GETUSER` and `ACL LIST` (#11224)\n* Client connections created for TLS-based replication use SNI if\n  possible (#11458)\n* Stream consumers: Re-purpose seen-time, add active-time (#11099)\n* XREADGROUP and X[AUTO]CLAIM create the consumer regardless of whether\n  it was able to perform some reading/claiming (#11099)\n* ACL default newly created user set sanitize-payload flag in ACL\n  LIST/GETUSER #11279\n* Fix HELLO command not to affect the client state unless successful\n  (#11659)\n* Normalize `NAN` in replies to a single nan type, like we do with `inf`\n  (#11597)\n* Cluster SHARD IDs are no longer visible in the cluster nodes output,\n  introduced in 7.2-RC1. (#10536, #12166)\n* When calling PUBLISH with a RESP3 client that's also subscribed to the\n  same channel, the order is changed and the reply is sent before the\n  published message (#12326)\n",
