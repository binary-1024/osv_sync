  "details": "Updated chrony package fixes security vulnerabilities:\n\nUsing particular address/subnet pairs when configuring access control would\ncause an invalid memory write. This could allow attackers to cause a denial\nof service (crash) or execute arbitrary code (CVE-2015-1821).\n\nWhen allocating memory to save unacknowledged replies to authenticated\ncommand requests, a pointer would be left uninitialized, which could trigger\nan invalid memory write. This could allow attackers to cause a denial of\nservice (crash) or execute arbitrary code (CVE-2015-1822).\n\nWhen peering with other NTP hosts using authenticated symmetric association,\nthe internal state variables would be updated before the MAC of the NTP\nmessages was validated. This could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial\nof service by impeding synchronization between NTP peers (CVE-2015-1853).\n",
