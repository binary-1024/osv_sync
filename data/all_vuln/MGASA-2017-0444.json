  "summary": "Updated tor packages fix security vulnerability",
  "details": "When checking for replays in the INTRODUCE1 cell data for a (legacy) onion\nservice, Tor didn't correctly detect replays in the RSA- encrypted part of\nthe cell. It was previously checking for replays on the entire cell, but\nthose can be circumvented due to the malleability of Tor's legacy hybrid\nencryption. This can lead to a traffic confirmation attack (CVE-2017-8819).\n\nDenial of service issue where an attacker could crash a directory authority\nusing a malformed router descriptor (CVE-2017-8820).\n\nDenial of service bug where an attacker could use a malformed directory\nobject to cause a Tor instance to pause while OpenSSL would try to read a\npassphrase from the terminal (CVE-2017-8821).\n\nWhen running as a relay, Tor could build a path through itself, especially\nwhen it lost the version of its descriptor appearing in the consensus. When\nrunning as a relay, it could also choose itself as a guard (CVE-2017-8822).\n\nUse-after-free error that could crash v2 Tor onion services when they failed\nto open circuits while expiring introduction points (CVE-2017-8823).\n",
