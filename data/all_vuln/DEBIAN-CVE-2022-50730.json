It convert unwritten extents to written, the extents could be merged to upper level and free extent blocks, so it could mark the inode dirty again even this inode has been marked I_FREEING. But the inode->i_io_list check and warning in ext4_evict_inode() missing this corner case. Fortunately, ext4_evict_inode() will wait all extents converting finished before this check, so it will not lead to inode use-after-free problem, every thing is OK besides this warning. The WARN_ON_ONCE was originally designed for finding inode use-after-free issues in advance, but if we add current dioread_nolock case in, it will become not quite useful, so fix this warning by just remove this check.   ======  WARNING: CPU: 7 PID: 1092 at fs/ext4/inode.c:227  ext4_evict_inode+0x875/0xc60  ...
