Applications that use the library to process untrusted input may be vulnerable to this flaw. An attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the system by abusing the python/object/new constructor.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"py3-yaml","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-yaml?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.3.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.10-r0","3.10-r1","3.11-r0","3.12-r0","3.12-r1","4.1-r0","5.1-r0","5.1.1-r0","5.1.2-r0","5.1.2-r1","5.1.2-r2","5.2-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-1747.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-yaml","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-yaml?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.3.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.10-r0","3.10-r1","3.11-r0","3.12-r0","3.12-r1","4.1-r0","5.1-r0","5.1.1-r0","5.1.2-r0","5.1.2-r1","5.1.2-r2","5.2-r0","5.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-1747.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-yaml","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-yaml?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.3.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.10-r0","3.10-r1","3.11-r0","3.12-r0","3.12-r1","4.1-r0","5.1-r0","5.1.1-r0","5.1.2-r0","5.1.2-r1","5.1.2-r2","5.2-r0","5.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-1747.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-yaml","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-yaml?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.3.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.10-r0","3.10-r1","3.11-r0","3.12-r0","3.12-r1","4.1-r0","5.1-r0","5.1.1-r0","5.1.2-r0","5.1.2-r1","5.1.2-r2","5.2-r0","5.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-1747.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-yaml","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-yaml?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.3.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.10-r0","3.10-r1","3.11-r0","3.12-r0","3.12-r1","4.1-r0","5.1-r0","5.1.1-r0","5.1.2-r0","5.1.2-r1","5.1.2-r2","5.2-r0","5.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-1747.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-yaml","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-yaml?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.3.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.10-r0","3.10-r1","3.11-r0","3.12-r0","3.12-r1","4.1-r0","5.1-r0","5.1.1-r0","5.1.2-r0","5.1.2-r1","5.1.2-r2","5.2-r0","5.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-1747.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-yaml","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-yaml?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.3.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.10-r0","3.10-r1","3.11-r0","3.12-r0","3.12-r1","4.1-r0","5.1-r0","5.1.1-r0","5.1.2-r0","5.1.2-r1","5.1.2-r2","5.2-r0","5.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-1747.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-yaml","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-yaml?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.3.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.10-r0","3.10-r1","3.11-r0","3.12-r0","3.12-r1","4.1-r0","5.1-r0","5.1.1-r0","5.1.2-r0","5.1.2-r1","5.1.2-r2","5.2-r0","5.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-1747.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-yaml","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-yaml?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.3.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.10-r0","3.10-r1","3.11-r0","3.12-r0","3.12-r1","4.1-r0","5.1-r0","5.1.1-r0","5.1.2-r0","5.1.2-r1","5.1.2-r2","5.2-r0","5.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-1747.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-yaml","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-yaml?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.3.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.10-r0","3.10-r1","3.11-r0","3.12-r0","3.12-r1","4.1-r0","5.1-r0","5.1.1-r0","5.1.2-r0","5.1.2-r1","5.1.2-r2","5.2-r0","5.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-1747.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-yaml","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-yaml?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.3.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.10-r0","3.10-r1","3.11-r0","3.12-r0","3.12-r1","4.1-r0","5.1-r0","5.1.1-r0","5.1.2-r0","5.1.2-r1","5.1.2-r2","5.2-r0","5.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-1747.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-yaml","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpi
