  "details": "HDF5 is a data model, library, and file format for storing and managing data. It supports an unlimited variety of datatypes, and is designed for flexible and efficient I/O and for high volume and complex data. HDF5 is portable and is extensible, allowing applications to evolve in their use of HDF5. The HDF5 Technology suite includes tools and applications for managing, manipulating, viewing, and analyzing data in the HDF5 format.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA heap-based buffer overflow in ReadGifImageDesc() in gifread.c in the HDF HDF5 through 1.10.3 library allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted HDF5 file. This issue was triggered while converting a GIF file to an HDF file.(CVE-2018-17433)\r\n\r\nReadCode() in decompress.c in the HDF HDF5 through 1.10.3 library allows attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid write access) via a crafted HDF5 file. This issue was triggered while converting a GIF file to an HDF file.(CVE-2018-17436)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in HDF5 through 1.12.0. A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the function Decompress() located in decompress.c. It can be triggered by sending a crafted file to the gif2h5 binary. It allows an attacker to cause Denial of Service.(CVE-2020-10809)",
