Prior to version 4.4.5, a Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in MobSF's Android manifest analysis allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a victim's browser session by uploading a malicious APK. The `android:host` attribute from `<data android:scheme=\"android_secret_code\">` elements is rendered in HTML reports without sanitization, enabling session hijacking and account takeover. Version 4.4.5 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mobsf/mobile-security-framework-mobsf","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2b08dd050e7685ee2a14fdbb454affab94129eae"}]}],"versions":["0.8.3","0.8.4","0.8.5","0.8.6","0.8.7","0.8.8","0.8.8.1","0.8.8.2","0.9","0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v0.9.3.1","v0.9.3.2","v0.9.3.3","v0.9.3.4","v0.9.3.5","v0.9.3.6","v0.9.3.7","v0.9.4","v0.9.4.1","v0.9.4.2","v0.9.5","v0.9.5.2","v0.9.5.4","v0.9.5.5","v1.0.3Beta","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v2.0.0","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.5","v3.1.1","v3.2.6","v3.2.8","v3.2.9","v3.3.3","v3.3.5","v3.4.0","v3.4.3","v3.4.6","v3.5.0","v3.6.0","v3.6.9","v3.7.6","v3.9.7","v4.0.7","v4.1.3","v4.3.0","v4.3.2","v4.4.1","v4.4.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24490.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24490.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/commit/2b08dd050e7685ee2a14fdbb454affab94129eae"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/releases/tag/v4.4.5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/security/advisories/GHSA-8hf7-h89p-3pqj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24490"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24490.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
