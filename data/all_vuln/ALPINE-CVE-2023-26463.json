There is initially incorrect access control, later followed by an expired pointer dereference. One attack vector is sending an untrusted client certificate during EAP-TLS. A server is affected only if it loads plugins that implement TLS-based EAP methods (EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, EAP-PEAP, or EAP-TNC). This is fixed in 5.9.10.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"strongswan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/strongswan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.9.10-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.5.2-r0","4.6.1-r0","5.1.1-r0","5.1.1-r1","5.1.1-r2","5.1.1-r3","5.1.3-r0","5.2.0-r0","5.2.0-r1","5.2.0-r2","5.2.2-r0","5.3.0-r0","5.3.0-r1","5.3.0-r2","5.3.1-r0","5.3.1-r1","5.3.1-r2","5.3.2-r0","5.3.2-r1","5.3.2-r10","5.3.2-r2","5.3.2-r3","5.3.2-r4","5.3.2-r5","5.3.2-r6","5.3.2-r7","5.3.2-r8","5.3.2-r9","5.3.3-r0","5.3.4-r0","5.3.5-r0","5.3.5-r1","5.3.5-r2","5.4.0-r0","5.4.0-r1","5.5.0-r0","5.5.0-r1","5.5.1-r0","5.5.1-r1","5.5.2-r0","5.5.2-r1","5.5.3-r0","5.5.3-r1","5.6.0-r0","5.6.0-r1","5.6.1-r0","5.6.2-r0","5.6.2-r1","5.6.3-r0","5.6.3-r1","5.6.3-r2","5.7.0-r0","5.7.1-r0","5.7.1-r1","5.7.1-r2","5.7.2-r0","5.7.2-r1","5.8.0-r0","5.8.0-r1","5.8.1-r0","5.8.1-r1","5.8.2-r0","5.8.3-r0","5.8.4-r0","5.8.4-r1","5.8.4-r2","5.9.0-r0","5.9.0-r1","5.9.1-r0","5.9.1-r1","5.9.1-r2","5.9.1-r3","5.9.1-r4","5.9.5-r0","5.9.5-r1","5.9.6-r0","5.9.7-r0","5.9.7-r1","5.9.8-r0","5.9.8-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-26463.json"}},{"package":{"name":"strongswan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/strongswan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.9.10-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.5.2-r0","4.6.1-r0","5.1.1-r0","5.1.1-r1","5.1.1-r2","5.1.1-r3","5.1.3-r0","5.2.0-r0","5.2.0-r1","5.2.0-r2","5.2.2-r0","5.3.0-r0","5.3.0-r1","5.3.0-r2","5.3.1-r0","5.3.1-r1","5.3.1-r2","5.3.2-r0","5.3.2-r1","5.3.2-r10","5.3.2-r2","5.3.2-r3","5.3.2-r4","5.3.2-r5","5.3.2-r6","5.3.2-r7","5.3.2-r8","5.3.2-r9","5.3.3-r0","5.3.4-r0","5.3.5-r0","5.3.5-r1","5.3.5-r2","5.4.0-r0","5.4.0-r1","5.5.0-r0","5.5.0-r1","5.5.1-r0","5.5.1-r1","5.5.2-r0","5.5.2-r1","5.5.3-r0","5.5.3-r1","5.6.0-r0","5.6.0-r1","5.6.1-r0","5.6.2-r0","5.6.2-r1","5.6.3-r0","5.6.3-r1","5.6.3-r2","5.7.0-r0","5.7.1-r0","5.7.1-r1","5.7.1-r2","5.7.2-r0","5.7.2-r1","5.8.0-r0","5.8.0-r1","5.8.1-r0","5.8.1-r1","5.8.2-r0","5.8.3-r0","5.8.4-r0","5.8.4-r1","5.8.4-r2","5.9.0-r0","5.9.0-r1","5.9.1-r0","5.9.1-r1","5.9.1-r2","5.9.1-r3","5.9.1-r4","5.9.5-r0","5.9.5-r1","5.9.6-r0","5.9.7-r0","5.9.7-r1","5.9.8-r0","5.9.8-r1","5.9.9-r0","5.9.9-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-26463.json"}},{"package":{"name":"strongswan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/strongswan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.9.10-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.5.2-r0","4.6.1-r0","5.1.1-r0","5.1.1-r1","5.1.1-r2","5.1.1-r3","5.1.3-r0","5.2.0-r0","5.2.0-r1","5.2.0-r2","5.2.2-r0","5.3.0-r0","5.3.0-r1","5.3.0-r2","5.3.1-r0","5.3.1-r1","5.3.1-r2","5.3.2-r0","5.3.2-r1","5.3.2-r10","5.3.2-r2","5.3.2-r3","5.3.2-r4","5.3.2-r5","5.3.2-r6","5.3.2-r7","5.3.2-r8","5.3.2-r9","5.3.3-r0","5.3.4-r0","5.3.5-r0","5.3.5-r1","5.3.5-r2","5.4.0-r0","5.4.0-r1","5.5.0-r0","5.5.0-r1","5.5.1-r0","5.5.1-r1","5.5.2-r0","5.5.2-r1","5.5.3-r0","5.5.3-r1","5.6.0-r0","5.6.0-r1","5.6.1-r0","5.6.2-r0","5.6.2-r1","5.6.3-r0","5.6.3-r1","5.6.3-r2","5.7.0-r0","5.7.1-r0","5.7.1-r1","5.7.1-r2","5.7.2-r0","5.7.2-r1","5.8.0-r0","5.8.0-r1","5.8.1-r0","5.8.1-r1","5.8.2-r0","5.8.3-r0","5.8.4-r0","5.8.4-r1","5.8.4-r2","5.9.0-r0","5.9.0-r1","5.9.1-r0","5.9.1-r1","5.9.1-r2","5.9.1-r3","5.9.1-r4","5.9.5-r0","5.9.5-r1","5.9.6-r0","5.9.7-r0","5.9.7-r1","5.9.8-r0","5.9.8-r1","5.9.9-r0","5.9.9-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-26463.json"}},{"package":{"name":"strongswan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/strongswan?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.9.10-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.5.2-r0","4.6.1-r0","5.1.1-r0","5.1.1-r1","5.1.1-r2","5.1.1-r3","5.1.3-r0","5.2.0-r0","5.2.0-r1","5.2.0-r2","5.2.2-r0","5.3.0-r0","5.3.0-r1","5.3.0-r2","5.3.1-r0","5.3.1-r1","5.3.1-r2","5.3.2-r0","5.3.2-r1","5.3.2-r10","5.3.2-r2","5.3.2-r3","5.3.2-r4","5.3.2-r5","5.3.2-r6","5.3.2-r7","5.3.2-r8","5.3.2-r9","5.3.3-r0","5.3.4-r0","5.3.5-r0","5.3.5-r1","5.3.5-r2","5.4.0-r0","5.4.0-r1","5.5.0-r0","5.5.0-r1","5.5.1-r0","5.5.1-r1","5.5.2-r0","5.5.2-r1","5.5.3-r0","5.5.3-r1","5.6.0-r0","5.6.0-r1","5.6.1-r0","5.6.2-r0","5.6.2-r1","5.6.3-r0","5.6.3-r1","5.6.3-r2","5.7.0-r0","5.7.1-r0","5.7.1-r1","5.7.1-r2","5.7.2-r0","5.7.2-r1","5.8.0-r0","5.8.0-r1","5.8.1-r0","5.8.1-r1","5.8.2-r0","5.8.3-r0","5.8.4-r0","5.8.4-r1","5.8.4-r2","5.9.0-r0","5.9.0-r1","5.9.1-r0","5.9.1-r1","5.9.1-r2","5.9.1-r3","5.9.1-r4","5.9.5-r0","5.9.5-r1","5.9.6-r0","5.9.7-r0","5.9.7-r1","5.9.8-r0","5.9.8-r1","5.9.9-r0","5.9.9-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-26463.json"}},{"package":{"name":"strongswan","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/strongswan?arch=sou
