Although the -ENOSPC is already a bug related to our space reservation code, let's just focus on the error handling.  For example, we have the following dirty range [0, 64K) of an inode, with 4K sector size and 4K page size:     0        16K        32K       48K       64K    |///////////////////////////////////////|    |#######################################|  Where |///| means page are still dirty, and |###| means the extent io tree has EXTENT_DELALLOC flag.  - Enter extent_writepage() for page 0  - Enter btrfs_run_delalloc_range() for range [0, 64K)  - Enter cow_file_range() for range [0, 64K)  - Function btrfs_reserve_extent() only reserved one 16K extent   So we created extent map and ordered extent for range [0, 16K)     0        16K        32K       48K       64K    |////////|//////////////////////////////|    |<- OE ->|##############################|     And range [0, 16K) has its delalloc flag cleared.    But since we haven't yet submit any bio, involved 4 pages are still    dirty.  - Function btrfs_reserve_extent() returns with -ENOSPC   Now we have to run error cleanup, which will clear all   EXTENT_DELALLOC* flags and clear the dirty flags for the remaining   ranges:     0        16K        32K       48K       64K    |////////|                              |    |        |                              |    Note that range [0, 16K) still has its pages dirty.  - Some time later, writeback is triggered again for the range [0, 16K)   since the page range still has dirty flags.  - btrfs_run_delalloc_range() will do nothing because there is no   EXTENT_DELALLOC flag.  - extent_writepage_io() finds page 0 has no ordered flag   Which falls into the COW fixup path, triggering the BUG_ON().  Unfortunately this error handling bug dates back to the introduction of btrfs.  Thankfully with the abuse of COW fixup, at least it won't crash the kernel.  [FIX] Instead of immediately unlocking the extent and folios, we keep the extent and folios locked until either erroring out or the whole delalloc range finished.  When the whole delalloc range finished without error, we just unlock the whole range with PAGE_SET_ORDERED (and PAGE_UNLOCK for !keep_locked cases)
