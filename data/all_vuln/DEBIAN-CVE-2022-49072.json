One such issue was observed for the gc->irq.domain variable which was accessed through the I2C interface in gpiochip_to_irq() before it could be initialized by gpiochip_add_irqchip(). This resulted in Kernel NULL pointer dereference.  Following are the logs for reference :-  kernel: Call Trace: kernel:  gpiod_to_irq+0x53/0x70 kernel:  acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get_by+0x113/0x1f0 kernel:  i2c_acpi_get_irq+0xc0/0xd0 kernel:  i2c_device_probe+0x28a/0x2a0 kernel:  really_probe+0xf2/0x460 kernel: RIP: 0010:gpiochip_to_irq+0x47/0xc0  To avoid such scenarios, restrict usage of GPIO chip irq members before they are completely initialized.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.113-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.103-1","5.10.103-1~bpo10+1","5.10.106-1","5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1","5.10.92-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49072.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.17.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49072.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.17.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49072.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.17.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49072.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-49072"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
