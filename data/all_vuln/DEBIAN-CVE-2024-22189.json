{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-22189","published":"2024-04-04T15:15:37Z","modified":"2025-10-14T04:26:26.982662Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-22189"],"details":"quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. Prior to version 0.42.0, an attacker can cause its peer to run out of memory sending a large number of `NEW_CONNECTION_ID` frames that retire old connection IDs. The receiver is supposed to respond to each retirement frame with a `RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID` frame. The attacker can prevent the receiver from sending out (the vast majority of) these `RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID` frames by collapsing the peers congestion window (by selectively acknowledging received packets) and by manipulating the peer's RTT estimate. Version 0.42.0 contains a patch for the issue. No known workarounds are available.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"golang-github-lucas-clemente-quic-go","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-lucas-clemente-quic-go?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.19.3-1","0.24.0-1","0.25.0-1","0.26.0-1","0.26.0-1~bpo11+1","0.29.0-1","0.29.0-1~bpo11+1","0.29.0-1~bpo11+2","0.29.2-1","0.29.2-2","0.29.2-3","0.37.0-1","0.37.4-1","0.37.4-1~bpo12+1","0.38.2-1","0.38.2-2","0.46.0-1","0.46.0-2","0.46.0-2~bpo12+1","0.50.0-1","0.50.1-1","0.50.1-2","0.54.0-1","0.54.0-2","0.54.0-3","0.54.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-22189.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-lucas-clemente-quic-go","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-lucas-clemente-quic-go?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.29.0-1","0.29.2-1","0.29.2-2","0.29.2-3","0.37.0-1","0.37.4-1","0.37.4-1~bpo12+1","0.38.2-1","0.38.2-2","0.46.0-1","0.46.0-2","0.46.0-2~bpo12+1","0.50.0-1","0.50.1-1","0.50.1-2","0.54.0-1","0.54.0-2","0.54.0-3","0.54.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-22189.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-lucas-clemente-quic-go","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-lucas-clemente-quic-go?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.46.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-22189.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-lucas-clemente-quic-go","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-lucas-clemente-quic-go?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.46.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-22189.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-22189"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
