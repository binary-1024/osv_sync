The unbounded memory buffering bugs:  - The header size limit check was behind the string reading code, so we needed to first buffer up to a 4 gigabyte string before rejecting it as longer than 8 or 16kb. - HPACK varints have an encoding quirk whereby an infinite number of 0’s can be added at the start of an integer. gRPC’s hpack parser needed to read all of them before concluding a parse. - gRPC’s metadata overflow check was performed per frame, so that the following sequence of frames could cause infinite buffering: HEADERS: containing a: 1 CONTINUATION: containing a: 2 CONTINUATION: containing a: 3 etc…","affected":[{"package":{"name":"grpc","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/grpc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.30.2-3","1.30.2-4","1.30.2-4+0.riscv64.1","1.30.2-4+0.riscv64.2","1.44.0-1","1.44.0-2","1.44.0-3","1.50.1-1","1.51.0-1","1.51.1-1","1.51.1-2","1.51.1-3","1.51.1-4","1.51.1-4.1","1.51.1-4.1~exp1","1.51.1-5","1.51.1-6","1.59.5-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-33953.json"}},{"package":{"name":"grpc","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/grpc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.51.1-3","1.51.1-4","1.51.1-4.1","1.51.1-4.1~exp1","1.51.1-5","1.51.1-6","1.59.5-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-33953.json"}},{"package":{"name":"grpc","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/grpc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.51.1-6","1.59.5-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-33953.json"}},{"package":{"name":"grpc","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/grpc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.51.1-6","1.59.5-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-33953.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-33953"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
