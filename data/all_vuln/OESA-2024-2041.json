Querying or changing XKB button actions such as moving from a touchpad to a mouse can result in out-of-bounds memory reads and writes. This may allow local privilege escalation or possible remote code execution in cases where X11 forwarding is involved.(CVE-2023-6377)\r\n\r\nA use-after-free vulnerability was found in the ProcRenderAddGlyphs() function of Xorg servers. This issue occurs when AllocateGlyph() is called to store new glyphs sent by the client to the X server, potentially resulting in multiple entries pointing to the same non-refcounted glyphs. Consequently, ProcRenderAddGlyphs() may free a glyph, leading to a use-after-free scenario when the same glyph pointer is subsequently accessed. This flaw allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system by sending a specially crafted request.(CVE-2024-31083)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"xorg-x11-server-xwayland","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/xorg-x11-server-xwayland&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"xorg-x11-server-Xwayland-22.1.2-6.oe2203sp3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["xorg-x11-server-Xwayland-22.1.2-6.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","xorg-x11-server-Xwayland-debuginfo-22.1.2-6.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","xorg-x11-server-Xwayland-debugsource-22.1.2-6.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","xorg-x11-server-Xwayland-devel-22.1.2-6.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["xorg-x11-server-Xwayland-22.1.2-6.oe2203sp3.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["xorg-x11-server-Xwayland-22.1.2-6.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","xorg-x11-server-Xwayland-debuginfo-22.1.2-6.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","xorg-x11-server-Xwayland-debugsource-22.1.2-6.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","xorg-x11-server-Xwayland-devel-22.1.2-6.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-2041.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2024-2041"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-6377"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31083"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
