RPKI Relying Parties (such as Fort) are supposed to maintain a backup cache of the remote RPKI data. This can be employed as a fallback in case a new fetch fails or yields incorrect files. However, the product currently uses its cache merely as a bandwidth saving tool (because fetching is performed through deltas). If a fetch fails midway or yields incorrect files, there is no viable fallback. This leads to incomplete route origin validation data.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"fort-validator","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/fort-validator?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.5.0-1","1.5.1-1","1.5.2-1","1.5.3-1","1.5.3-1~deb11u1","1.5.3-1~deb11u2","1.5.4-1","1.5.4-1~bpo11+1","1.6.1-1","1.6.1-1~bpo12+2","1.6.2-1","1.6.3-1","1.6.3-1~bpo12+1","1.6.4+20240930-1","1.6.4+20240930-1~bpo12+1","1.6.5-1","1.6.6-1","1.6.6-1~bpo12+1","1.6.7-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-56169.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fort-validator","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/fort-validator?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.5.4-1","1.5.4-1+deb12u1","1.6.1-1","1.6.1-1~bpo12+2","1.6.2-1","1.6.3-1","1.6.3-1~bpo12+1","1.6.4+20240930-1","1.6.4+20240930-1~bpo12+1","1.6.5-1","1.6.6-1","1.6.6-1~bpo12+1","1.6.7-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-56169.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fort-validator","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/fort-validator?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.6.6-1","1.6.7-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-56169.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fort-validator","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/fort-validator?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.6.6-1","1.6.7-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-56169.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-56169"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
