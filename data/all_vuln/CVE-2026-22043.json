In versions 1.0.0-alpha.13 through 1.0.0-alpha.78, a flawed `deny_only` short-circuit in RustFS IAM allows a restricted service account or STS credential to self-issue an unrestricted service account, inheriting the parent’s full privileges. This enables privilege escalation and bypass of session/inline policy restrictions. Version 1.0.0-alpha.79 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rustfs/rustfs","events":[{"introduced":"b97845fffdae24affedc2e95153da7bf75049a95"},{"last_affected":"3c1494787848b38e0aff9608869007ab0f9b501d"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0-alpha.13","1.0.0-alpha.14","1.0.0-alpha.15","1.0.0-alpha.16","1.0.0-alpha.17","1.0.0-alpha.18","1.0.0-alpha.19","1.0.0-alpha.20","1.0.0-alpha.21","1.0.0-alpha.22","1.0.0-alpha.23","1.0.0-alpha.24","1.0.0-alpha.25","1.0.0-alpha.26","1.0.0-alpha.27","1.0.0-alpha.28","1.0.0-alpha.29","1.0.0-alpha.30","1.0.0-alpha.31","1.0.0-alpha.32","1.0.0-alpha.33","1.0.0-alpha.34","1.0.0-alpha.35","1.0.0-alpha.36","1.0.0-alpha.37","1.0.0-alpha.38","1.0.0-alpha.39","1.0.0-alpha.40","1.0.0-alpha.41","1.0.0-alpha.42","1.0.0-alpha.43","1.0.0-alpha.44","1.0.0-alpha.45","1.0.0-alpha.46","1.0.0-alpha.47","1.0.0-alpha.48","1.0.0-alpha.49","1.0.0-alpha.50","1.0.0-alpha.51","1.0.0-alpha.52","1.0.0-alpha.53","1.0.0-alpha.54","1.0.0-alpha.55","1.0.0-alpha.56","1.0.0-alpha.57","1.0.0-alpha.58","1.0.0-alpha.59","1.0.0-alpha.60","1.0.0-alpha.61","1.0.0-alpha.62","1.0.0-alpha.63","1.0.0-alpha.64","1.0.0-alpha.65","1.0.0-alpha.66","1.0.0-alpha.67","1.0.0-alpha.68","1.0.0-alpha.69","1.0.0-alpha.70","1.0.0-alpha.71","1.0.0-alpha.72","1.0.0-alpha.73","1.0.0-alpha.74","1.0.0-alpha.75","1.0.0-alpha.76","1.0.0-alpha.77","1.0.0-alpha.78"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22043.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/rustfs/rustfs/security/advisories/GHSA-xgr5-qc6w-vcg9"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
