In some extreme corner cases when compressed data is suitably corrupted, UAF will occur.  As reported by KASAN [1], LZ4_decompress_safe_partial may lead to read out of bound problem during decoding.  lz4 upstream has fixed it [2] and this issue has been disscussed here [3] before.  current decompression routine was ported from lz4 v1.8.3, bumping lib/lz4 to v1.9.+ is certainly a huge work to be done later, so, we'd better fix it first.
