{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49876","published":"2025-05-01T15:16:12Z","modified":"2025-09-30T03:54:19Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-49876"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mac80211: fix general-protection-fault in ieee80211_subif_start_xmit()  When device is running and the interface status is changed, the gpf issue is triggered. The problem triggering process is as follows: Thread A:                           Thread B ieee80211_runtime_change_iftype()   process_one_work()     ...                                 ...     ieee80211_do_stop()                 ...     ...                                 ...         sdata->bss = NULL               ...         ...                             ieee80211_subif_start_xmit()                                             ieee80211_multicast_to_unicast                                     //!sdata->bss->multicast_to_unicast                                       cause gpf issue  When the interface status is changed, the sending queue continues to send packets. After the bss is set to NULL, the bss is accessed. As a result, this causes a general-protection-fault issue.  The following is the stack information: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc000000002f: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000178-0x000000000000017f] Workqueue: mld mld_ifc_work RIP: 0010:ieee80211_subif_start_xmit+0x25b/0x1310 Call Trace: <TASK> dev_hard_start_xmit+0x1be/0x990 __dev_queue_xmit+0x2c9a/0x3b60 ip6_finish_output2+0xf92/0x1520 ip6_finish_output+0x6af/0x11e0 ip6_output+0x1ed/0x540 mld_sendpack+0xa09/0xe70 mld_ifc_work+0x71c/0xdb0 process_one_work+0x9bf/0x1710 worker_thread+0x665/0x1080 kthread+0x2e4/0x3a0 ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30 </TASK>","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49876.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49876.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49876.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-49876"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
