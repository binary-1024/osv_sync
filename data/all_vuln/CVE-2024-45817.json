  "details": "In x86's APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) architecture,\nerror conditions are reported in a status register.  Furthermore, the OS\ncan opt to receive an interrupt when a new error occurs.\n\nIt is possible to configure the error interrupt with an illegal vector,\nwhich generates an error when an error interrupt is raised.\n\nThis case causes Xen to recurse through vlapic_error().  The recursion\nitself is bounded; errors accumulate in the the status register and only\ngenerate an interrupt when a new status bit becomes set.\n\nHowever, the lock protecting this state in Xen will try to be taken\nrecursively, and deadlock.",
