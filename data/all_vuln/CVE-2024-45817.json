Furthermore, the OS\ncan opt to receive an interrupt when a new error occurs.\n\nIt is possible to configure the error interrupt with an illegal vector,\nwhich generates an error when an error interrupt is raised.\n\nThis case causes Xen to recurse through vlapic_error().  The recursion\nitself is bounded; errors accumulate in the the status register and only\ngenerate an interrupt when a new status bit becomes set.\n\nHowever, the lock protecting this state in Xen will try to be taken\nrecursively, and deadlock.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-462.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-462.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/09/24/1"}]}
