When g_file_replace() is used with G_FILE_CREATE_REPLACE_DESTINATION to replace a path that is a dangling symlink, it incorrectly also creates the target of the symlink as an empty file, which could conceivably have security relevance if the symlink is attacker-controlled. (If the path is a symlink to a file that already exists, then the contents of that file correctly remain unchanged.)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"Glib_jll","ecosystem":"Julia","purl":"pkg:julia/Glib_jll?uuid=7746bdde-850d-59dc-9ae8-88ece973131d"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.68.1+0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/SecurityAdvisories.jl/tree/generated/osv/2025/JLSEC-2025-158.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/issues/2325"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/06/msg00006.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6RXTD5HCP2K4AAUSWWZTBKQNHRCTAEOF/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ICUTQPHZNZWX2DZR46QFLQZRHVMHIILJ/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-13"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210416-0003/"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC-BY-4.0","sources":[{"html_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28153","id":"CVE-2021-28153","imported":"2025-10-19T21:13:23.544Z","modified":"2024-11-21T05:59:11.820Z","published":"2021-03-11T22:15:12.777Z","url":"https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2021-28153"}]}}
