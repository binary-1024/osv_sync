{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68802","published":"2026-01-13T16:16:02.260Z","modified":"2026-01-14T11:11:00.439037Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-68802"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/xe: Limit num_syncs to prevent oversized allocations  The exec and vm_bind ioctl allow userspace to specify an arbitrary num_syncs value. Without bounds checking, a very large num_syncs can force an excessively large allocation, leading to kernel warnings from the page allocator as below.  Introduce DRM_XE_MAX_SYNCS (set to 1024) and reject any request exceeding this limit.  \" ------------[ cut here ]------------ WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1217 at mm/page_alloc.c:5124 __alloc_frozen_pages_noprof+0x2f8/0x2180 mm/page_alloc.c:5124 ...
