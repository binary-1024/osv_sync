{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"UBUNTU-CVE-2024-49769","published":"2024-10-29T15:15:00Z","modified":"2025-10-24T05:13:16Z","related":["USN-7115-1"],"upstream":["CVE-2024-49769"],"details":"Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. When a remote client closes the connection before waitress has had the opportunity to call getpeername() waitress won't correctly clean up the connection leading to the main thread attempting to write to a socket that no longer exists, but not removing it from the list of sockets to attempt to process. This leads to a busy-loop calling the write function. A remote attacker could run waitress out of available sockets with very little resources required. Waitress 3.0.1 contains fixes that remove the race condition.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"waitress","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/waitress@0.8.10-1?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.8.9-2ubuntu1","0.8.10-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"python-waitress","binary_version":"0.8.10-1"},{"binary_name":"python3-waitress","binary_version":"0.8.10-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2024/UBUNTU-CVE-2024-49769.json"}},{"package":{"name":"waitress","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/waitress@1.0.1-1?arch=source&distro=bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"python-waitress","binary_version":"1.0.1-1"},{"binary_name":"python3-waitress","binary_version":"1.0.1-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2024/UBUNTU-CVE-2024-49769.json"}},{"package":{"name":"waitress","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:20.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/waitress@1.4.1-1ubuntu0.2?arch=source&distro=focal"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.1-1ubuntu0.2"}]}],"versions":["1.2.0~b2-2","1.3.1-4","1.4.1-1","1.4.1-1ubuntu0.1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"python3-waitress","binary_version":"1.4.1-1ubuntu0.2"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2024/UBUNTU-CVE-2024-49769.json"}},{"package":{"name":"waitress","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:22.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/waitress@1.4.4-1.1ubuntu1.1?arch=source&distro=jammy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.4-1.1ubuntu1.1"}]}],"versions":["1.4.4-1.1","1.4.4-1.1ubuntu1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"python3-waitress","binary_version":"1.4.4-1.1ubuntu1.1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2024/UBUNTU-CVE-2024-49769.json"}},{"package":{"name":"waitress","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:Pro:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/waitress@2.1.2-2ubuntu0.1~esm1?arch=source&distro=esm-apps/noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.1.2-2ubuntu0.1~esm1"}]}],"versions":["2.1.2-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"Available with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro","binaries":[{"binary_name":"python3-waitress","binary_version":"2.1.2-2ubuntu0.1~esm1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2024/UBUNTU-CVE-2024-49769.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-49769"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-49769"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-3f84-rpwh-47g6"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/418"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/435"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/commit/1ae4e894c9f76543bee06584001583fc6fa8c95c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7115-1"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
