A further deletion of other nodes in the tree (which also could free the nodes), the aforementioned node's `znode->cparent` could still point to a freed node. This `znode->cparent` may not be updated when getting nodes to commit in `ubifs_tnc_start_commit()`. This could then trigger a use-after-free when accessing the `znode->cparent` in `write_index()` in `ubifs_tnc_end_commit()`.  This can be triggered by running    rm -f /etc/test-file.bin   dd if=/dev/urandom of=/etc/test-file.bin bs=1M count=60 conv=fsync  in a loop, and with `CONFIG_UBIFS_FS_AUTHENTICATION`.

More specifically, consider the following TNC:           zroot          /         /       zp1       /      /     zn  Inserting a new node `zn_new` with a key smaller then `zn` will trigger a split in `tnc_insert()` if `zp1` is full:           zroot          /   \\         /     \\       zp1     zp2       /         \\      /           \\   zn_new          zn  `zn->parent` has now been moved to `zp2`, *but* `zn->cparent` still points to `zp1`.  Now, consider a removal of all the nodes _except_ `zn`. Just when `tnc_delete()` is about to delete `zroot` and `zp2`:           zroot              \\               \\               zp2                 \\                  \\                  zn  `zroot` and `zp2` get freed and the tree collapses:             zn  `zn` now becomes the new `zroot`.  `get_znodes_to_commit()` will now only find `zn`, the new `zroot`, and `write_index()` will check its `znode->cparent` that wrongly points to the already freed `zp1`. `ubifs_copy_hash()` thus gets wrongly called with `znode->cparent->zbranch[znode->iip].hash` that triggers the use-after-free!  Fix this by explicitly setting `znode->cparent` to `NULL` in `get_znodes_to_commit()` for the root node.
