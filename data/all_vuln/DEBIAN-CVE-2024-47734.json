{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47734","published":"2024-10-21T13:15:03Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:19:38.914207Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-47734"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bonding: Fix unnecessary warnings and logs from bond_xdp_get_xmit_slave()  syzbot reported a WARNING in bond_xdp_get_xmit_slave. To reproduce this[1], one bond device (bond1) has xdpdrv, which increases bpf_master_redirect_enabled_key. Another bond device (bond0) which is unsupported by XDP but its slave (veth3) has xdpgeneric that returns XDP_TX. This triggers WARN_ON_ONCE() from the xdp_master_redirect(). To reduce unnecessary warnings and improve log management, we need to delete the WARN_ON_ONCE() and add ratelimit to the netdev_err().
