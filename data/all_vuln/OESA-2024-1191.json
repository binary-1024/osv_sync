In affected versions missing input validation on mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie value makes the server vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. An internal security audit has been conducted and the reviewers found that if they manipulated the value of the mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie to a very large integer, like 99999999, the server struggles with the request for a long time and finally gets back with a 500 error. Making a few requests of this kind caused our server to become unresponsive. Attackers can craft requests that would make the server work very hard (and possibly become unresponsive) and/or crash with minimal effort. This issue has been addressed in version 2.4.15.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.(CVE-2024-24814)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mod_auth_openidc","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/mod_auth_openidc&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.15.3-1.oe2203"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["mod_auth_openidc-debugsource-2.4.15.3-1.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","mod_auth_openidc-2.4.15.3-1.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","mod_auth_openidc-debuginfo-2.4.15.3-1.oe2203.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["mod_auth_openidc-2.4.15.3-1.oe2203.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["mod_auth_openidc-2.4.15.3-1.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","mod_auth_openidc-debuginfo-2.4.15.3-1.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","mod_auth_openidc-debugsource-2.4.15.3-1.oe2203.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-1191.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2024-1191"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24814"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
