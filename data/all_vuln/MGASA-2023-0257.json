  "details": "A vulnerability in the filesystem image parser for Hierarchical File\nSystem Plus (HFS+) of ClamAV could allow an unauthenticated, remote\nattacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected\ndevice. This vulnerability is due to an incorrect check for completion\nwhen a file is decompressed, which may result in a loop condition that\ncould cause the affected software to stop responding. An attacker could\nexploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HFS+ filesystem image\nto be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could\nallow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to stop\nresponding, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected software and\nconsuming available system resources. (CVE-2023-20197)\n\nA vulnerability in the AutoIt module of ClamAV could allow an\nunauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)\ncondition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to a logic\nerror in the memory management of an affected device. An attacker could\nexploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted AutoIt file to be\nscanned by ClamAV on the affected device. A successful exploit could\nallow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to restart\nunexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. (CVE-2023-20212)\n",
