The BGP daemon's support for RFC 8203 administrative shutdown communication messages included an incorrect logical expression when checking the validity of an input message. Sending a shutdown communication with a sufficient message length causes a four-byte overflow to occur while processing the message, where two of the overflow bytes are attacker-controlled and two are fixed.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"bird","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/bird?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.6.8-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-16159.json"}},{"package":{"name":"bird","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/bird?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.6.8-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-16159.json"}},{"package":{"name":"bird2","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/bird2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.0.6-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-16159.json"}},{"package":{"name":"bird2","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/bird2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.0.6-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-16159.json"}},{"package":{"name":"bird2","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/bird2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.0.6-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-16159.json"}},{"package":{"name":"bird2","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/bird2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.0.6-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-16159.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-16159"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
