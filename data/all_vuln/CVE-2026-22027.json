Prior to version 1.4.3, the convert_hexstring_to_byte_array() function in the MariaDB SA interface writes decoded bytes into a caller-provided buffer without any capacity check. When importing SA fields from the database (e.g., IV, ARSN, ABM), a malformed or oversized hex string in the database can overflow the destination buffer, corrupting adjacent heap memory. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nasa/cryptolib","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9ffda0ff78e8f74c58db4c181923196870e04c3e"}]}],"versions":["v0.1-engineering-release","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22027.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22027.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/commit/2372efd3da1ccb226b4297222e25f41ecc84821d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/releases/tag/v1.4.3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-3m35-m689-h29x"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22027"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-122"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22027.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:H/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
