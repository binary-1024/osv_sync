{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-21451","published":"2026-01-02T20:37:06.795Z","modified":"2026-01-13T19:58:49.612031Z","aliases":["GHSA-2mwc-h2mg-v6p8"],"summary":"Bagisto has HTML Filter Bypass that Enables Stored XSS","details":"Bagisto is an open source laravel eCommerce platform. A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Bagisto prior to version 2.3.10 within the CMS page editor. Although the platform normally attempts to sanitize `<script>` tags, the filtering can be bypassed by manipulating the raw HTTP POST request before submission. As a result, arbitrary JavaScript can be stored in the CMS content and executed whenever the page is viewed or edited. This exposes administrators to a high-severity risk, including complete account takeover, backend hijacking, and malicious script execution. Version 2.3.10 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bagisto/bagisto","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"813e28551dd1d3207b9e275e6c2bd63f68f0f8b0"}]}],"versions":["1.4.0","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.4-BETA1","v0.1.4-BETA2","v0.1.4-BETA3","v0.1.4-BETA4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.1.6-ALPHA1","v0.1.7","v0.1.7-BETA1","v0.1.7-BETA2","v0.1.8","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-BETA1","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-BETA1","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-BETA-1","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.10","v2.2.2","v2.2.3","v2.2.4","v2.2.5","v2.2.6","v2.2.7","v2.2.8","v2.2.9","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.3.3","v2.3.4","v2.3.5","v2.3.6","v2.3.7","v2.3.8","v2.3.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-21451.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/21xxx/CVE-2026-21451.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/bagisto/bagisto/security/advisories/GHSA-2mwc-h2mg-v6p8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-21451"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/21xxx/CVE-2026-21451.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:N/E:P"}]}
