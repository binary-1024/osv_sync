This scheme is used to maintain invariants required for Xen's safety, e.g. PV guests may not have direct writeable access to pagetables; updates need auditing by Xen. Unfortunately, Xen's safety logic doesn't account for CPU-induced cache non-coherency; cases where the CPU can cause the content of the cache to be different to the content in main memory. In such cases, Xen's safety logic can incorrectly conclude that the contents of a page is safe.","references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/06/09/4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-402.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-23"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5184"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-402.txt"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OH65U6FTTB5MLH5A6Q3TW7KVCGOG4MYI/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RKRXZ4LHGCGMOG24ZCEJNY6R2BTS4S2Q/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
