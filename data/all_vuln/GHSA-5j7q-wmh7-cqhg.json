{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-5j7q-wmh7-cqhg","published":"2026-01-13T20:37:30Z","modified":"2026-01-13T20:56:18.265217Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-59020"],"summary":"TYPO3 CMS Allows Broken Access Control in Edit Document Controller","details":"### Problem\nBy exploiting the `defVals` parameter, attackers could bypass field‑level access checks during record creation in the TYPO3 backend. This gave them the ability to insert arbitrary data into prohibited exclude fields of a database table for which the user already has write permission for a reduced set of fields.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 10.4.55 ELTS, 11.5.49 ELTS, 12.4.41 LTS, 13.4.23 LTS, 14.0.2 that fix the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Daniel Windloff for reporting this issue, and to TYPO3 core & security team member Benjamin Franzke for fixing it.\n\n### References\n*
