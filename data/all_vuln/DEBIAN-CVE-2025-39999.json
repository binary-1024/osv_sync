The problem is that hctx->sched_tags is from elevator->et->tags, while et->tags is still the freed tags, hence later elevator exit will try to free the tags again, causing kernel panic.  Fix this problem by replacing et->tags with new allocated tags as well.  Noted there are still some long term problems that will require some refactor to be fixed thoroughly[1].
