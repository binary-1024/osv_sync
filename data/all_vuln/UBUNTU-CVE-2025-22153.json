Via a type confusion bug in versions of the CPython interpreter starting in 3.11 and prior to 3.13.2 when using `try/except*`, RestrictedPython starting in version 6.0 and prior to version 8.0 could be bypassed. The issue is patched in version 8.0 of RestrictedPython by removing support for `try/except*` clauses. No known workarounds are available.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"restrictedpython","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:Pro:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/restrictedpython@6.2-1ubuntu0.24.04.1~esm1?arch=source&distro=esm-apps/noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.2-1ubuntu0.24.04.1~esm1"}]}],"versions":["4.0~b3-3","6.2-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"Available with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro","binaries":[{"binary_name":"python3-restrictedpython","binary_version":"6.2-1ubuntu0.24.04.1~esm1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-22153.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-22153"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22153"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/zopefoundation/RestrictedPython/security/advisories/GHSA-gmj9-h825-chq2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7355-1"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
