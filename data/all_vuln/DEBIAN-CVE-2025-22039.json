  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ksmbd: fix overflow in dacloffset bounds check  The dacloffset field was originally typed as int and used in an unchecked addition, which could overflow and bypass the existing bounds check in both smb_check_perm_dacl() and smb_inherit_dacl().  This could result in out-of-bounds memory access and a kernel crash when dereferencing the DACL pointer.  This patch converts dacloffset to unsigned int and uses check_add_overflow() to validate access to the DACL.",
