This allocation is explicitly freed by unregister_framebuffer() in simplefb_remove(). Devres managed cleanup runs after the device remove call and thus can no longer access struct simplefb_par. Call simplefb_detach_genpds() explicitly from simplefb_destroy() like the cleanup functions for clocks and regulators.  Fixes an use after free on M2 Mac mini during aperture_remove_conflicting_devices() using the downstream asahi kernel with Debian's kernel config. For unknown reasons this started to consistently dereference an invalid pointer in v6.16.3 based kernels.
