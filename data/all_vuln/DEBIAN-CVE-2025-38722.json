  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  habanalabs: fix UAF in export_dmabuf()  As soon as we'd inserted a file reference into descriptor table, another thread could close it.  That's fine for the case when all we are doing is returning that descriptor to userland (it's a race, but it's a userland race and there's nothing the kernel can do about it).  However, if we follow fd_install() with any kind of access to objects that would be destroyed on close (be it the struct file itself or anything destroyed by its ->release()), we have a UAF.  dma_buf_fd() is a combination of reserving a descriptor and fd_install(). habanalabs export_dmabuf() calls it and then proceeds to access the objects destroyed on close.  In particular, it grabs an extra reference to another struct file that will be dropped as part of ->release() for ours; that \"will be\" is actually \"might have already been\".  Fix that by reserving descriptor before anything else and do fd_install() only when everything had been set up.  As a side benefit, we no longer have the failure exit with file already created, but reference to underlying file (as well as ->dmabuf_export_cnt, etc.) not grabbed yet; unlike dma_buf_fd(), fd_install() can't fail.",
