{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-42085","published":"2024-07-29T17:15:11Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:19:24.364084Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-42085"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: dwc3: core: remove lock of otg mode during gadget suspend/resume to avoid deadlock  When config CONFIG_USB_DWC3_DUAL_ROLE is selected, and trigger system to enter suspend status with below command: echo mem > /sys/power/state There will be a deadlock issue occurring. Detailed invoking path as below: dwc3_suspend_common()     spin_lock_irqsave(&dwc->lock, flags);              <-- 1st     dwc3_gadget_suspend(dwc);         dwc3_gadget_soft_disconnect(dwc);             spin_lock_irqsave(&dwc->lock, flags);      <-- 2nd This issue is exposed by commit c7ebd8149ee5 (\"usb: dwc3: gadget: Fix NULL pointer dereference in dwc3_gadget_suspend\") that removes the code of checking whether dwc->gadget_driver is NULL or not. It causes the following code is executed and deadlock occurs when trying to get the spinlock. In fact, the root cause is the commit 5265397f9442(\"usb: dwc3: Remove DWC3 locking during gadget suspend/resume\") that forgot to remove the lock of otg mode. So, remove the redundant lock of otg mode during gadget suspend/resume.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.98-1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.27-1","6.1.37-1","6.1.38-1","6.1.38-2","6.1.38-2~bpo11+1","6.1.38-3","6.1.38-4","6.1.38-4~bpo11+1","6.1.52-1","6.1.55-1","6.1.55-1~bpo11+1","6.1.64-1","6.1.66-1","6.1.67-1","6.1.69-1","6.1.69-1~bpo11+1","6.1.76-1","6.1.76-1~bpo11+1","6.1.82-1","6.1.85-1","6.1.90-1","6.1.90-1~bpo11+1","6.1.94-1","6.1.94-1~bpo11+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-42085.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.9.8-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-42085.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.9.8-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-42085.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux-6.1","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-6.1?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.119-1~deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.106-3~deb11u1","6.1.106-3~deb11u2","6.1.106-3~deb11u3","6.1.112-1~deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-42085.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-42085"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
