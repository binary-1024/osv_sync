{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50219","published":"2025-06-18T11:15:52Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:16:00.410735Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-50219"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Fix KASAN use-after-free Read in compute_effective_progs  Syzbot found a Use After Free bug in compute_effective_progs(). The reproducer creates a number of BPF links, and causes a fault injected alloc to fail, while calling bpf_link_detach on them. Link detach triggers the link to be freed by bpf_link_free(), which calls __cgroup_bpf_detach() and update_effective_progs(). If the memory allocation in this function fails, the function restores the pointer to the bpf_cgroup_link on the cgroup list, but the memory gets freed just after it returns. After this, every subsequent call to update_effective_progs() causes this already deallocated pointer to be dereferenced in prog_list_length(), and triggers KASAN UAF error.  To fix this issue don't preserve the pointer to the prog or link in the list, but remove it and replace it with a dummy prog without shrinking the table. The subsequent call to __cgroup_bpf_detach() or __cgroup_bpf_detach() will correct it.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.140-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.103-1","5.10.103-1~bpo10+1","5.10.106-1","5.10.113-1","5.10.120-1","5.10.120-1~bpo10+1","5.10.127-1","5.10.127-2","5.10.127-2~bpo10+1","5.10.136-1","5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1","5.10.92-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50219.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50219.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50219.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50219.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-50219"}]}
