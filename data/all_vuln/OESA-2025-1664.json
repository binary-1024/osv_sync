This tool is an open source implementation of the SSH protocol, supports encryption of all transmissions, and can effectively prevent eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other network-level attacks.\n OpenSSH (OpenBSD Secure Shell) versions before 10.0 have a security vulnerability that originated from the DisableForwarding directive that does not correctly disable X11 and proxy forwarding.(CVE-2025-32728)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"openssh","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/openssh&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.8p1-35.oe2203sp3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["openssh-8.8p1-35.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","openssh-askpass-8.8p1-35.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","openssh-clients-8.8p1-35.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","openssh-debuginfo-8.8p1-35.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","openssh-debugsource-8.8p1-35.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","openssh-keycat-8.8p1-35.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","openssh-server-8.8p1-35.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","pam_ssh_agent_auth-0.10.4-4.35.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["openssh-help-8.8p1-35.oe2203sp3.noarch.rpm"],"src":["openssh-8.8p1-35.oe2203sp3.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["openssh-8.8p1-35.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","openssh-askpass-8.8p1-35.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","openssh-clients-8.8p1-35.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","openssh-debuginfo-8.8p1-35.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","openssh-debugsource-8.8p1-35.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","openssh-keycat-8.8p1-35.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","openssh-server-8.8p1-35.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","pam_ssh_agent_auth-0.10.4-4.35.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1664.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-1664"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32728"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Low"}}
