An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, and 3.7.16.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"pypy3","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/pypy3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.3.5+dfsg-2+deb11u4"}]}],"versions":["7.3.5+dfsg-2","7.3.5+dfsg-2+deb11u1","7.3.5+dfsg-2+deb11u2","7.3.5+dfsg-2+deb11u3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-45061.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pypy3","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/pypy3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.3.11+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-45061.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pypy3","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/pypy3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.3.11+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-45061.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pypy3","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/pypy3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.3.11+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-45061.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python2.7","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python2.7?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.7.18-10","2.7.18-11","2.7.18-12","2.7.18-13","2.7.18-13.1","2.7.18-13.1~exp1","2.7.18-13.2","2.7.18-8","2.7.18-8+deb11u1","2.7.18-9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-45061.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python3.11","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python3.11?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.11.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-45061.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python3.9","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python3.9?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.9.2-1+deb11u2"}]}],"versions":["3.9.2-1","3.9.2-1+deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-45061.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-45061"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
