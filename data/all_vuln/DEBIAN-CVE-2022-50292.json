  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm/dp: fix bridge lifetime  Device-managed resources allocated post component bind must be tied to the lifetime of the aggregate DRM device or they will not necessarily be released when binding of the aggregate device is deferred.  This can lead resource leaks or failure to bind the aggregate device when binding is later retried and a second attempt to allocate the resources is made.  For the DP bridges, previously allocated bridges will leak on probe deferral.  Fix this by amending the DP parser interface and tying the lifetime of the bridge device to the DRM device rather than DP platform device.
