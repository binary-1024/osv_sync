GLib&apos;s code was separated from GTK, so it can be used by software other than GNOME and has been developed in parallel ever since.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.66.8. When g_file_replace() is used with G_FILE_CREATE_REPLACE_DESTINATION to replace a path that is a dangling symlink, it incorrectly also creates the target of the symlink as an empty file, which could conceivably have security relevance if the symlink is attacker-controlled. (If the path is a symlink to a file that already exists, then the contents of that file correctly remain unchanged.)(CVE-2021-28153)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"glib2","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/glib2&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.62.5-7.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["glib2-debuginfo-2.62.5-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","glib2-debugsource-2.62.5-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","glib2-devel-2.62.5-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","glib2-2.62.5-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["glib2-help-2.62.5-7.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["glib2-2.62.5-7.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["glib2-debuginfo-2.62.5-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","glib2-devel-2.62.5-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","glib2-2.62.5-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","glib2-debugsource-2.62.5-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1164.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1164"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28153"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
