If an attacker gains access to cache storage (e.g., filesystem, Memcached, Redis, etc.), they can construct a crafted payload, poison the cache, and execute Python code. NOTE: a third party indicates that exploitation is extremely unlikely unless the machine is already compromised; in other cases, the attacker would be unable to write their payload to the cache and generate the required collision","affected":[{"package":{"name":"flask-caching","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/flask-caching?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.1-1","1.11.1-1","1.9.0-1","2.0.0-1","2.0.1-1","2.0.1-2","2.0.1-3","2.0.2-1","2.1.0-1","2.2.0-1","2.3.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-33026.json"}},{"package":{"name":"flask-caching","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/flask-caching?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.2-1","2.1.0-1","2.2.0-1","2.3.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-33026.json"}},{"package":{"name":"flask-caching","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/flask-caching?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.3.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-33026.json"}},{"package":{"name":"flask-caching","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/flask-caching?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.3.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-33026.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33026"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
