{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50870","published":"2025-12-30T13:16:01.887Z","modified":"2025-12-31T11:10:19.372340Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-50870"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/rtas: avoid device tree lookups in rtas_os_term()  rtas_os_term() is called during panic. Its behavior depends on a couple of conditions in the /rtas node of the device tree, the traversal of which entails locking and local IRQ state changes. If the kernel panics while devtree_lock is held, rtas_os_term() as currently written could hang.  Instead of discovering the relevant characteristics at panic time, cache them in file-static variables at boot. Note the lookup for \"ibm,extended-os-term\" is converted to of_property_read_bool() since it is a boolean property, not an RTAS function token.
