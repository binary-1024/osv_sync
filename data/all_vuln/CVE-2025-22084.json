  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nw1: fix NULL pointer dereference in probe\n\nThe w1_uart_probe() function calls w1_uart_serdev_open() (which includes\ndevm_serdev_device_open()) before setting the client ops via\nserdev_device_set_client_ops(). This ordering can trigger a NULL pointer\ndereference in the serdev controller's receive_buf handler, as it assumes\nserdev->ops is valid when SERPORT_ACTIVE is set.\n\nThis is similar to the issue fixed in commit 5e700b384ec1\n(\"platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: properly fix race condition\") where\ndevm_serdev_device_open() was called before fully initializing the\ndevice.\n\nFix the race by ensuring client ops are set before enabling the port via\nw1_uart_serdev_open().",
