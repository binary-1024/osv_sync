  "details": "An attacker could, via a specially crafted multipart response, execute arbitrary JavaScript under the `resource://devtools` origin.  This could allow them to access cross-origin JSON content. This access is limited to \"same site\" documents by the Site Isolation feature on desktop clients, but full cross-origin access is possible on Android versions. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 131, Firefox ESR < 128.3, Firefox ESR < 115.16, Thunderbird < 128.3, and Thunderbird < 131.",
