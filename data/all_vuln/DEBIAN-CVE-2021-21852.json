A specially crafted MPEG-4 input at “stss” decoder can cause an integer overflow due to unchecked arithmetic resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ccextractor","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ccextractor?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.88+ds1-1","0.93+ds1-1","0.93+ds2-1","0.93+ds2-2","0.94+ds1-1","0.94+ds1-2","0.94+ds1-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-21852.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gpac","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gpac?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.1+dfsg1-4+deb11u2"}]}],"versions":["1.0.1+dfsg1-4","1.0.1+dfsg1-4+deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-21852.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-21852"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
