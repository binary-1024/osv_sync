When a disk is removed, bdi_unregister is called to stop further write-back and waits for associated delayed work to complete. However, wb_inode_writeback_end() may schedule bandwidth estimation work after this has completed, which can result in the timer attempting to access the recently freed bdi_writeback.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0412"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-0562"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2258475"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-mm/patch/20220801155034.3772543-1-khazhy@google.com/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
