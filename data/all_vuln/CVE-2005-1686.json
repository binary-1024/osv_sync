NOTE: while this issue is triggered on the command line by the gedit user, it has been reported that web browsers and email clients could be configured to provide a file name as an argument to gedit, so there is a valid attack that crosses security boundaries.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://security.gentoo.org/glsa/glsa-200506-09.xml"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.debian.org/security/2005/dsa-753"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.novell.com/linux/security/advisories/2005_36_sudo.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=111661117701398&w=2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2005-499.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://oval.cisecurity.org/repository/search/definition/oval%3Aorg.mitre.oval%3Adef%3A1245"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://oval.cisecurity.org/repository/search/definition/oval%3Aorg.mitre.oval%3Adef%3A9845"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/138-1/"}]}
