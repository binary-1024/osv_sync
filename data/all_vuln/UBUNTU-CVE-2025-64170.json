Starting in version 0.2.7 and prior to version 0.2.10, if a user begins entering a password but does not press return for an extended period, a password timeout may occur. When this happens, the keystrokes that were entered are echoed back to the console. This could reveal partial password information, possibly exposing history files when not carefully handled by the user and on screen, usable for Social Engineering or Pass-By attacks. Version 0.2.10 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"rust-sudo-rs","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.10","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/rust-sudo-rs@0.2.8-1ubuntu5.2?arch=source&distro=questing"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.2.8-1ubuntu5.2"}]}],"versions":["0.2.4-1","0.2.5-3ubuntu1","0.2.5-4","0.2.5-5","0.2.5-5ubuntu1","0.2.5-5ubuntu3","0.2.8-1ubuntu2","0.2.8-1ubuntu3","0.2.8-1ubuntu4","0.2.8-1ubuntu5","0.2.8-1ubuntu5.1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"sudo-rs","binary_version":"0.2.8-1ubuntu5.2"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-64170.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-64170"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64170"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/sudo-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-c978-wq47-pvvw"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7867-1"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
