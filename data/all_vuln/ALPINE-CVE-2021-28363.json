{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2021-28363","published":"2021-03-15T18:15:19.017Z","modified":"2025-11-19T06:19:53.294457Z","upstream":["CVE-2021-28363"],"details":"The urllib3 library 1.26.x before 1.26.4 for Python omits SSL certificate validation in some cases involving HTTPS to HTTPS proxies. The initial connection to the HTTPS proxy (if an SSLContext isn't given via proxy_config) doesn't verify the hostname of the certificate. This means certificates for different servers that still validate properly with the default urllib3 SSLContext will be silently accepted.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"py3-urllib3","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-urllib3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.26.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.18-r0","1.21.1-r0","1.22-r0","1.24.1-r0","1.24.1-r1","1.24.2-r0","1.25.1-r0","1.25.10-r0","1.25.11-r0","1.25.2-r0","1.25.3-r0","1.25.5-r0","1.25.6-r0","1.25.6-r1","1.25.7-r0","1.25.7-r1","1.25.8-r0","1.25.9-r0","1.26.0-r0","1.26.1-r0","1.26.2-r0","1.26.2-r1","1.26.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-28363.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-urllib3","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-urllib3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.26.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.18-r0","1.21.1-r0","1.22-r0","1.24.1-r0","1.24.1-r1","1.24.2-r0","1.25.1-r0","1.25.10-r0","1.25.11-r0","1.25.2-r0","1.25.3-r0","1.25.5-r0","1.25.6-r0","1.25.6-r1","1.25.7-r0","1.25.7-r1","1.25.8-r0","1.25.9-r0","1.26.0-r0","1.26.1-r0","1.26.2-r0","1.26.2-r1","1.26.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-28363.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-urllib3","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-urllib3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.26.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.18-r0","1.21.1-r0","1.22-r0","1.24.1-r0","1.24.1-r1","1.24.2-r0","1.25.1-r0","1.25.10-r0","1.25.11-r0","1.25.2-r0","1.25.3-r0","1.25.5-r0","1.25.6-r0","1.25.6-r1","1.25.7-r0","1.25.7-r1","1.25.8-r0","1.25.9-r0","1.26.0-r0","1.26.1-r0","1.26.2-r0","1.26.2-r1","1.26.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-28363.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-urllib3","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-urllib3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.26.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.18-r0","1.21.1-r0","1.22-r0","1.24.1-r0","1.24.1-r1","1.24.2-r0","1.25.1-r0","1.25.10-r0","1.25.11-r0","1.25.2-r0","1.25.3-r0","1.25.5-r0","1.25.6-r0","1.25.6-r1","1.25.7-r0","1.25.7-r1","1.25.8-r0","1.25.9-r0","1.26.0-r0","1.26.1-r0","1.26.2-r0","1.26.2-r1","1.26.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-28363.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-urllib3","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-urllib3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.26.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.18-r0","1.21.1-r0","1.22-r0","1.24.1-r0","1.24.1-r1","1.24.2-r0","1.25.1-r0","1.25.10-r0","1.25.11-r0","1.25.2-r0","1.25.3-r0","1.25.5-r0","1.25.6-r0","1.25.6-r1","1.25.7-r0","1.25.7-r1","1.25.8-r0","1.25.9-r0","1.26.0-r0","1.26.1-r0","1.26.2-r0","1.26.2-r1","1.26.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-28363.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-urllib3","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-urllib3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.26.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.18-r0","1.21.1-r0","1.22-r0","1.24.1-r0","1.24.1-r1","1.24.2-r0","1.25.1-r0","1.25.10-r0","1.25.11-r0","1.25.2-r0","1.25.3-r0","1.25.5-r0","1.25.6-r0","1.25.6-r1","1.25.7-r0","1.25.7-r1","1.25.8-r0","1.25.9-r0","1.26.0-r0","1.26.1-r0","1.26.2-r0","1.26.2-r1","1.26.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-28363.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-urllib3","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-urllib3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.26.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.18-r0","1.21.1-r0","1.22-r0","1.24.1-r0","1.24.1-r1","1.24.2-r0","1.25.1-r0","1.25.10-r0","1.25.11-r0","1.25.2-r0","1.25.3-r0","1.25.5-r0","1.25.6-r0","1.25.6-r1","1.25.7-r0","1.25.7-r1","1.25.8-r0","1.25.9-r0","1.26.0-r0","1.26.1-r0","1.26.2-r0","1.26.2-r1","1.26.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-28363.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-urllib3","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-urllib3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.26.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.18-r0","1.21.1-r0","1.22-r0","1.24.1-r0","1.24.1-r1","1.24.2-r0","1.25.1-r0","1.25.10-r0","1.25.11-r0","1.25.2-r0","1.25.3-r0","1.25.5-r0","1.25.6-r0","1.25.6-r1","1.25.7-r0","1.25.7-r1","1.25.8-r0","1.25.9-r0","1.26.0-r0","1.26.1-r0","1.26.2-r0","1.26.2-r1","1.26.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-28363.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-urllib3","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-urllib3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.26.4-r0"}]}],
