Asking to convert a name that is exactly 256\nbytes, libcurl ends up reading outside of a stack based buffer when built to\nuse the *macidn* IDN backend. The conversion function then fills up the\nprovided buffer exactly - but does not null terminate the string.\n\nThis flaw can lead to stack contents accidently getting returned as part of\nthe converted string.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"LibCURL_jll","ecosystem":"Julia","purl":"pkg:julia/LibCURL_jll?uuid=deac9b47-8bc7-5906-a0fe-35ac56dc84c0"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"8.8.0+0"},{"fixed":"8.9.0+0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/SecurityAdvisories.jl/tree/generated/osv/2025/JLSEC-2025-37.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/24/2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2024-6874.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2024-6874.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/2604391"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240822-0004/"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC-BY-4.0","sources":[{"html_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6874","id":"CVE-2024-6874","imported":"2025-10-10T14:33:22.351Z","modified":"2024-11-21T09:50:26.493Z","published":"2024-07-24T08:15:03.413Z","url":"https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2024-6874"}]}}
