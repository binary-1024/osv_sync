{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49065","published":"2025-02-26T07:00:43Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:18:31.553864Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-49065"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  SUNRPC: Fix the svc_deferred_event trace class  Fix a NULL deref crash that occurs when an svc_rqst is deferred while the sunrpc tracing subsystem is enabled. svc_revisit() sets dr->xprt to NULL, so it can't be relied upon in the tracepoint to provide the remote's address.  Unfortunately we can't revert the \"svc_deferred_class\" hunk in commit ece200ddd54b (\"sunrpc: Save remote presentation address in svc_xprt for trace events\") because there is now a specific check of event format specifiers for unsafe dereferences. The warning that check emits is:    event svc_defer_recv has unsafe dereference of argument 1  A \"%pISpc\" format specifier with a \"struct sockaddr *\" is indeed flagged by this check.  Instead, take the brute-force approach used by the svcrdma_qp_error tracepoint. Convert the dr::addr field into a presentation address in the TP_fast_assign() arm of the trace event, and store that as a string. This fix can be backported to -stable kernels.  In the meantime, commit c6ced22997ad (\"tracing: Update print fmt check to handle new __get_sockaddr() macro\") is now in v5.18, so this wonky fix can be replaced with __sockaddr() and friends properly during the v5.19 merge window.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.113-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.103-1","5.10.103-1~bpo10+1","5.10.106-1","5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1","5.10.92-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49065.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.17.6-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49065.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.17.6-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49065.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.17.6-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49065.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-49065"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
