In drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_ca_en50221.c, a use-after-free can occur is there is a disconnect after an open, because of the lack of a wait_event.(CVE-2022-45919)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in drivers/bluetooth/hci_ldisc.c in the Linux kernel 6.2. In hci_uart_tty_ioctl, there is a race condition between HCIUARTSETPROTO and HCIUARTGETPROTO. HCI_UART_PROTO_SET is set before hu-&gt;proto is set. A NULL pointer dereference may occur.(CVE-2023-31083)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in drivers/mtd/ubi/cdev.c in the Linux kernel 6.2. There is a divide-by-zero error in do_div(sz,mtd-&gt;erasesize), used indirectly by ctrl_cdev_ioctl, when mtd-&gt;erasesize is 0.(CVE-2023-31085)\r\n\r\nClosing of an event channel in the Linux kernel can result in a deadlock. This happens when the close is being performed in parallel to an unrelated Xen console action and the handling of a Xen console interrupt in an unprivileged guest. The closing of an event channel is e.g. triggered by removal of a paravirtual device on the other side. As this action will cause console messages to be issued on the other side quite often, the chance of triggering the deadlock is not neglectable.\nA (malicious) guest administrator could cause a denial of service (DoS) in a backend domain (other than dom0) by disabling a paravirtualized device. A malicious backend could cause DoS in a guest running a Linux kernel by disabling a paravirtualized device.(CVE-2023-34324)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the XFRM subsystem in the Linux kernel. The specific flaw exists within the processing of state filters, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. This flaw allows a local privileged (CAP_NET_ADMIN) attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to an information disclosure.(CVE-2023-39194)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in lib/kobject.c in the Linux kernel before 6.2.3. With root access, an attacker can trigger a race condition that results in a fill_kobj_path out-of-bounds write.(CVE-2023-45863)\r\n\r\nA heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernel&apos;s Linux Kernel Performance Events (perf) component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\r\n\r\nIf perf_read_group() is called while an event&apos;s sibling_list is smaller than its child&apos;s sibling_list, it can increment or write to memory locations outside of the allocated buffer.\r\n\r\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 32671e3799ca2e4590773fd0e63aaa4229e50c06.\r\n\r\n(CVE-2023-5717)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kernel","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/kernel&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.aarch64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["kernel-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.x86_64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.x86_64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2311.1.0.0224.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2023-1780.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2023-1780"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-44033"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-45919"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31083"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31085"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34324"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39194"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45863"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-5717"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
