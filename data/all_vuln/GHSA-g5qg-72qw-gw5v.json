  "details": "A vulnerability in Next.js Image Optimization has been fixed in v15.4.5 and v14.2.31. When images returned from API routes vary based on request headers (such as `Cookie` or `Authorization`), these responses could be incorrectly cached and served to unauthorized users due to a cache key confusion bug.\n\nAll users are encouraged to upgrade if they use API routes to serve images that depend on request headers and have image optimization enabled.\n\nMore details at [Vercel Changelog](https://vercel.com/changelog/cve-2025-57752)",
