In 3.25.0 and 3.26.0, there is a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the CKM_ECDH_AES_KEY_WRAP implementation allows an attacker with local access to cause out-of-bounds writes in the host process by supplying a compressed EC public key and invoking C_WrapKey. This can lead to heap corruption, or denial-of-service.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opencryptoki/opencryptoki","events":[{"introduced":"c20ccf12bab4877088a2b8b01a3168bfe407218b"},{"last_affected":"68399abca844480ec3c49164ab7c19bb7667c558"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.25.0"},{"last_affected":"3.26.0"}]}}],"versions":["v3.25.0","v3.26.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22791.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22791.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/opencryptoki/opencryptoki/commit/785d7577e1477d12fbe235554e7e7b24f2de34b7"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/opencryptoki/opencryptoki/commit/e37e9127deeeb7bf3c3c4d852c594256c57ec3a8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/opencryptoki/opencryptoki/security/advisories/GHSA-26f5-3mwq-4wm7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22791"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-131"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22791.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H"}]}
