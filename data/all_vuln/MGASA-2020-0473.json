  "summary": "Updated libvirt packages fix security vulnerability",
  "details": "A double free memory issue was found to occur in the libvirt API responsible\nfor requesting information about network interfaces of a running QEMU domain.\nThis flaw affects the polkit access control driver. Specifically, clients\nconnecting to the read-write socket with limited ACL permissions could use this\nflaw to crash the libvirt daemon, resulting in a denial of service, or\npotentially escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from\nthis vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system\navailability (CVE-2020-25637).\n",
