Sites where PHP is configured with zend.exception_ignore_args = 'On' or zend.exception_ignore_args = 1 in the relevant php.ini file are NOT affected by this vulnerability. Sites that do not have the zend.exception_ignore_args setting enabled and are using the internal Moodle LMS authentication system are affected by this vulnerability.",
