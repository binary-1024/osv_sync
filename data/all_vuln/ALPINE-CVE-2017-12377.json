The vulnerability is due to improper input validation checking mechanisms in mew packet files sent to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause a heap-based buffer over-read condition in mew.c when ClamAV scans the malicious file, allowing the attacker to cause a DoS condition or potentially execute arbitrary code on the affected device.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"clamav","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/clamav?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.99.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["0.94.2-r0","0.94.2-r1","0.94.2-r2","0.95.1-r0","0.95.1-r1","0.95.2-r0","0.95.2-r1","0.95.3-r0","0.95.3-r1","0.96-r0","0.96.1-r0","0.96.2-r0","0.96.3-r0","0.96.4-r0","0.96.5-r0","0.97-r0","0.97-r1","0.97-r2","0.97-r3","0.97-r4","0.97.1-r0","0.97.2-r0","0.97.3-r0","0.97.3-r1","0.97.3-r2","0.97.3-r3","0.97.4-r0","0.97.4-r1","0.97.4-r2","0.97.5-r0","0.97.6-r0","0.97.6-r1","0.97.7-r0","0.97.8-r0","0.97.8-r1","0.97.8-r2","0.98-r0","0.98-r1","0.98.1-r0","0.98.1-r1","0.98.1-r2","0.98.3-r0","0.98.4-r0","0.98.4-r1","0.98.5-r0","0.98.6-r0","0.98.6-r1","0.98.6-r2","0.98.7-r0","0.98.7-r1","0.98.7-r2","0.99-r0","0.99-r1","0.99-r2","0.99-r3","0.99.1-r0","0.99.1-r1","0.99.1-r2","0.99.2-r0","0.99.2-r1","0.99.2-r2","0.99.2-r3","0.99.2-r4","0.99.2-r5","0.99.2-r6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-12377.json"}},{"package":{"name":"clamav","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/clamav?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.99.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["0.94.2-r0","0.94.2-r1","0.94.2-r2","0.95.1-r0","0.95.1-r1","0.95.2-r0","0.95.2-r1","0.95.3-r0","0.95.3-r1","0.96-r0","0.96.1-r0","0.96.2-r0","0.96.3-r0","0.96.4-r0","0.96.5-r0","0.97-r0","0.97-r1","0.97-r2","0.97-r3","0.97-r4","0.97.1-r0","0.97.2-r0","0.97.3-r0","0.97.3-r1","0.97.3-r2","0.97.3-r3","0.97.4-r0","0.97.4-r1","0.97.4-r2","0.97.5-r0","0.97.6-r0","0.97.6-r1","0.97.7-r0","0.97.8-r0","0.97.8-r1","0.97.8-r2","0.98-r0","0.98-r1","0.98.1-r0","0.98.1-r1","0.98.1-r2","0.98.3-r0","0.98.4-r0","0.98.4-r1","0.98.5-r0","0.98.6-r0","0.98.6-r1","0.98.6-r2","0.98.7-r0","0.98.7-r1","0.98.7-r2","0.99-r0","0.99-r1","0.99-r2","0.99-r3","0.99.1-r0","0.99.1-r1","0.99.1-r2","0.99.2-r0","0.99.2-r1","0.99.2-r2","0.99.2-r3","0.99.2-r4","0.99.2-r5","0.99.2-r6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-12377.json"}},{"package":{"name":"clamav","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/clamav?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.99.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["0.94.2-r0","0.94.2-r1","0.94.2-r2","0.95.1-r0","0.95.1-r1","0.95.2-r0","0.95.2-r1","0.95.3-r0","0.95.3-r1","0.96-r0","0.96.1-r0","0.96.2-r0","0.96.3-r0","0.96.4-r0","0.96.5-r0","0.97-r0","0.97-r1","0.97-r2","0.97-r3","0.97-r4","0.97.1-r0","0.97.2-r0","0.97.3-r0","0.97.3-r1","0.97.3-r2","0.97.3-r3","0.97.4-r0","0.97.4-r1","0.97.4-r2","0.97.5-r0","0.97.6-r0","0.97.6-r1","0.97.7-r0","0.97.8-r0","0.97.8-r1","0.97.8-r2","0.98-r0","0.98-r1","0.98.1-r0","0.98.1-r1","0.98.1-r2","0.98.3-r0","0.98.4-r0","0.98.4-r1","0.98.5-r0","0.98.6-r0","0.98.6-r1","0.98.6-r2","0.98.7-r0","0.98.7-r1","0.98.7-r2","0.99-r0","0.99-r1","0.99-r2","0.99-r3","0.99.1-r0","0.99.1-r1","0.99.1-r2","0.99.2-r0","0.99.2-r1","0.99.2-r2","0.99.2-r3","0.99.2-r4","0.99.2-r5","0.99.2-r6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-12377.json"}},{"package":{"name":"clamav","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/clamav?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.99.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["0.94.2-r0","0.94.2-r1","0.94.2-r2","0.95.1-r0","0.95.1-r1","0.95.2-r0","0.95.2-r1","0.95.3-r0","0.95.3-r1","0.96-r0","0.96.1-r0","0.96.2-r0","0.96.3-r0","0.96.4-r0","0.96.5-r0","0.97-r0","0.97-r1","0.97-r2","0.97-r3","0.97-r4","0.97.1-r0","0.97.2-r0","0.97.3-r0","0.97.3-r1","0.97.3-r2","0.97.3-r3","0.97.4-r0","0.97.4-r1","0.97.4-r2","0.97.5-r0","0.97.6-r0","0.97.6-r1","0.97.7-r0","0.97.8-r0","0.97.8-r1","0.97.8-r2","0.98-r0","0.98-r1","0.98.1-r0","0.98.1-r1","0.98.1-r2","0.98.3-r0","0.98.4-r0","0.98.4-r1","0.98.5-r0","0.98.6-r0","0.98.6-r1","0.98.6-r2","0.98.7-r0","0.98.7-r1","0.98.7-r2","0.99-r0","0.99-r1","0.99-r2","0.99-r3","0.99.1-r0","0.99.1-r1","0.99.1-r2","0.99.2-r0","0.99.2-r1","0.99.2-r2","0.99.2-r3","0.99.2-r4","0.99.2-r5","0.99.2-r6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-12377.json"}},{"package":{"name":"clamav","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.8","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/clamav?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.99.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["0.94.2-r0","0.94.2-r1","0.94.2-r2","0.95.1-r0","0.95.1-r1","0.95.2-r0","0.95.2-r1","0.95.3-r0","0.95.3-r1","0.96-r0","0.96.1-r0","0.96.2-r0","0.96.3-r0","0.96.4-r0","0.96.5-r0","0.97-r0","0.97-r1","0.97-r2","0.97-r3","0.97-r4","0.97.1-r0","0.97.2-r0","0.97.3-r0","0.97.3-r1","0.97.3-r2","0.97.3-r3","0.97.4-r0","0.97.4-r1","0.97.4-r2","0.97.5-r0","0.97.6-r0","0.97.6-r1","0.97.7-r0","0.97.8-r0","0.97.8-r1","0.97.8-r2","0.98-r0","0.98-r1","0.98.1-r0","0.98.1-r1","0.98.1-r2","0.98.3-r0","0.98.4-r0","0.98
