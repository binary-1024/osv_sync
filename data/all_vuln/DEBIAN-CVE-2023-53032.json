When first_ip is 0, last_ip is 0xFFFFFFFF, and netmask is 31, the value of an arithmetic expression 2 << (netmask - mask_bits - 1) is subject to overflow due to a failure casting operands to a larger data type before performing the arithmetic.  Note that it's harmless since the value will be checked at the next step.
