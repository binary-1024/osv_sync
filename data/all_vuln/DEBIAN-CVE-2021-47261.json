However, the offending commit started to use function get_cqe() for getting the CQEs, the issue with this change is that get_cqe() always returns CQEs from cq->buf, which leads us to initialize the wrong buffer, and in case of enlarging the CQ we try to access elements beyond the size of the current cq->buf and eventually hit a kernel panic.
