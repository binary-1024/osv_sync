{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2018-14028","published":"2018-08-10T16:29:00Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:11:53.070079Z","upstream":["CVE-2018-14028"],"details":"In WordPress 4.9.7, plugins uploaded via the admin area are not verified as being ZIP files. This allows for PHP files to be uploaded. Once a PHP file is uploaded, the plugin extraction fails, but the PHP file remains in a predictable wp-content/uploads location, allowing for an attacker to then execute the file. This represents a security risk in limited scenarios where an attacker (who does have the required capabilities for plugin uploads) cannot simply place arbitrary PHP code into a valid plugin ZIP file and upload that plugin, because a machine's wp-content/plugins directory permissions were set up to block all new plugins.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wordpress","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/wordpress?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.7.1+dfsg1-2","5.7.11+dfsg1-0+deb11u1","5.7.3+dfsg1-0+deb11u1","5.7.5+dfsg1-0+deb11u1","5.7.8+dfsg1-0+deb11u1","5.7.8+dfsg1-0+deb11u2","5.8.1+dfsg1-1","5.8.1+dfsg1-2","5.8.2+dfsg1-1","5.8.3+dfsg1-1","5.9.2+dfsg1-1","5.9.2+dfsg1-2","6.0+dfsg1-1","6.0.2+dfsg1-1","6.0.3+dfsg1-1","6.1+dfsg1-1","6.1.1+dfsg1-1","6.2+dfsg1-1","6.2.1+dfsg1-1","6.2.2+dfsg1-1","6.3+dfsg1-1","6.3.1+dfsg1-1","6.3.2+dfsg1-1","6.4.1+dfsg1-1","6.4.1+dfsg1-1.1","6.4.2+dfsg1-1","6.4.3+dfsg1-1","6.5+dfsg1-1","6.5.2+dfsg1-1","6.5.3+dfsg1-1","6.5.5+dfsg1-1","6.6.1+dfsg1-1","6.7.2+dfsg1-1","6.7.2+dfsg1-1.1","6.8.1+dfsg1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-14028.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wordpress","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/wordpress?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.1.1+dfsg1-1","6.1.6+dfsg1-0+deb12u1","6.2+dfsg1-1","6.2.1+dfsg1-1","6.2.2+dfsg1-1","6.3+dfsg1-1","6.3.1+dfsg1-1","6.3.2+dfsg1-1","6.4.1+dfsg1-1","6.4.1+dfsg1-1.1","6.4.2+dfsg1-1","6.4.3+dfsg1-1","6.5+dfsg1-1","6.5.2+dfsg1-1","6.5.3+dfsg1-1","6.5.5+dfsg1-1","6.6.1+dfsg1-1","6.7.2+dfsg1-1","6.7.2+dfsg1-1.1","6.8.1+dfsg1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-14028.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wordpress","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/wordpress?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.8.1+dfsg1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-14028.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wordpress","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/wordpress?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.8.1+dfsg1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-14028.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-14028"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
