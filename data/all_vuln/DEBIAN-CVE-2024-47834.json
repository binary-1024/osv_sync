{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47834","published":"2024-12-12T02:03:43Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:19:39.446658Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-47834"],"details":"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An Use-After-Free read vulnerability has been discovered affecting the processing of CodecPrivate elements in Matroska streams. In the GST_MATROSKA_ID_CODECPRIVATE case within the gst_matroska_demux_parse_stream function, a data chunk is allocated using gst_ebml_read_binary. Later, the allocated memory is freed in the gst_matroska_track_free function, by the call to g_free (track->codec_priv). Finally, the freed memory is accessed in the caps_serialize function through gst_value_serialize_buffer. The freed memory will be accessed in the gst_value_serialize_buffer function. This results in a UAF read vulnerability, as the function tries to process memory that has already been freed. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-good1.0","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gst-plugins-good1.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.18.4-2+deb11u3"}]}],"versions":["1.18.4-2","1.18.4-2+deb11u1","1.18.4-2+deb11u2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47834.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-good1.0","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gst-plugins-good1.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.22.0-5+deb12u2"}]}],"versions":["1.22.0-5","1.22.0-5+deb12u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47834.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-good1.0","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gst-plugins-good1.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.24.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47834.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-good1.0","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gst-plugins-good1.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.24.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47834.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-47834"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"}]}
