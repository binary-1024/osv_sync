{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-38153","published":"2025-07-03T09:15:30Z","modified":"2025-10-13T11:19:50.657160Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-38153"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: usb: aqc111: fix error handling of usbnet read calls  Syzkaller, courtesy of syzbot, identified an error (see report [1]) in aqc111 driver, caused by incomplete sanitation of usb read calls' results. This problem is quite similar to the one fixed in commit 920a9fa27e78 (\"net: asix: add proper error handling of usb read errors\").  For instance, usbnet_read_cmd() may read fewer than 'size' bytes, even if the caller expected the full amount, and aqc111_read_cmd() will not check its result properly. As [1] shows, this may lead to MAC address in aqc111_bind() being only partly initialized, triggering KMSAN warnings.  Fix the issue by verifying that the number of bytes read is as expected and not less.
