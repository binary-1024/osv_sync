The main package includes the libvirtd server exporting the virtualization support.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn off-by-one error flaw was found in the udevListInterfacesByStatus() function in libvirt when the number of interfaces exceeds the size of the `names` array. This issue can be reproduced by sending specially crafted data to the libvirt daemon, allowing an unprivileged client to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon to crash.(CVE-2024-1441)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the RPC library APIs of libvirt. The RPC server deserialization code allocates memory for arrays before the non-negative length check is performed by the C API entry points. Passing a negative length to the g_new0 function results in a crash due to the negative length being treated as a huge positive number. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon to crash.(CVE-2024-2494)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libvirt","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/libvirt&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libvirt-daemon-driver-qemu-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-rbd-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-config-network-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-admin-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-iscsi-direct-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-bash-completion-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-mpath-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-kvm-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-interface-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-logical-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-config-nwfilter-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-core-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-devel-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-gluster-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-secret-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-nss-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-docs-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-nodedev-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-debugsource-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-libs-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-disk-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-qemu-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-nwfilter-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-client-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-lock-sanlock-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-scsi-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-network-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-debuginfo-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-wireshark-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-iscsi-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["libvirt-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libvirt-wireshark-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-nwfilter-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-lock-sanlock-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-scsi-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-mpath-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-iscsi-direct-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-client-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-network-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-secret-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-admin-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-devel-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-qemu-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-docs-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-iscsi-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-disk-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-config-network-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-nodedev-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-qemu-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-debugsource-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-gluster-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-libs-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-interface-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-nss-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-kvm-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-rbd-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-config-nwfilter-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-logical-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-debuginfo-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-bash-completion-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-core-6.2.0-24.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-1469.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2024-1469"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1441"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-2494"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
