There are also variations with AWS clients\n\nApparently, the campaign started at least 2 years ago with the snapshot-photo package containing the same functionality as the newer time-check-server (see https://github.com/pypi-data/pypi-mirror-238/blob/code/packages/snapshot-photo/snapshot_photo-0.0.3-py3-none-any.whl/snapshot_photo/date_format.py).\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\nCampaign: 2025-02-alicloud-client\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n - clones_real_package\n - action-hidden-in-lib-usage\n - The malicious code is intentionally included in a dependency of the package\n - exfiltration_cloud_tokens\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"credential-python-sdk","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/credential-python-sdk"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.0.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/credential-python-sdk/MAL-2025-2950.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://x.com/ReversingLabs/status/1900198602242204003"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-CREDENTIALPYTHONSDK-12201349"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pypi-data/pypi-mirror-238/blob/code/packages/snapshot-photo/snapshot_photo-0.0.3-py3-none-any.whl/snapshot_photo/date_format.py"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/malicious-pypi-packages-stole-cloud.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/credential-python-sdk"}],"database_specific":{"iocs":{"domains":["checktimeserver.org","aliyun-sdk-requests.xyz"],"urls":["https://api.checktimeserver.org/","https://api.aliyun-sdk-requests.xyz/"]},"malicious-packages-origins":[{"id":"RLMA-2025-01948","import_time":"2025-03-31T07:07:05.109232043Z","modified_time":"2025-03-28T13:05:30Z","sha256":"98c6376a072729cd054d1650147ae1f38ba5ebe4182ccabc085ff7689a392f5e","source":"reversing-labs","versions":["0.0.3"]},{"id":"RLUA-2025-04755","import_time":"2025-09-26T11:06:10.062827406Z","modified_time":"2025-09-26T09:13:51Z","sha256":"ccb75be9c570fba4a5794bea20205e89e2d4e5f8d24d654e0cb08c6729ee1435","source":"reversing-labs"},{"id":"pypi/2025-02-alicloud-client/credential-python-sdk","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:55.073490315Z","modified_time":"2025-02-25T18:18:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"ac81bbfc5a381702150076db0a7049386690e545f3fede3d4247fc6deb4b331b","source":"kam193"}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"ReversingLabs","contact":["https://www.reversinglabs.com"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
