Version 5.3.2 of the Astropy core package is vulnerable to remote code execution due to improper input validation in the `TranformGraph().to_dot_graph` function. A malicious user can provide a command or a script file as a value to the `savelayout` argument, which will be placed as the first value in a list of arguments passed to `subprocess.Popen`.  Although an error will be raised, the command or script will be executed successfully. Version 5.3.3 fixes this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"astropy","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/astropy?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.2-6","4.3.1-1","4.3.1-2","4.3.1-3","4.3.1-4","4.3~rc1-1","4.3~rc1-2","5.0-1","5.0.1-1","5.0.2-1","5.0.2-2","5.0.3-1","5.0.4-1","5.0~rc1-1","5.0~rc1-2","5.0~rc1-3","5.0~rc1-4","5.0~rc1-5","5.0~rc2-1","5.1-1","5.1-2","5.1-3","5.1-4","5.1.1-1","5.1~rc1-1","5.1~rc1-2","5.1~rc1-3","5.2-1","5.2.1-1","5.2.1-2","5.2~rc1-1","5.3-1","5.3.1-1","5.3.1-2","5.3.2-1","5.3.3-1","5.3.4-1","5.3.4-2","5.3~rc1-1","6.0.0-1","6.0.0~rc1-1","6.0.0~rc2-1","6.0.0~rc2-2","6.0.1-1","6.0.1-2","6.0.1-3","6.0.1-4","6.1.1-1","6.1.2-1","6.1.3-1","6.1.4-1","6.1.4-2","6.1.5-1","6.1.5-2","7.0.0-1","7.0.0-2","7.0.0-3","7.0.0-4","7.0.0-5","7.0.0~rc1-1","7.0.1-1","7.0.1-2","7.0.1-3","7.0.1-4","7.0.1-5","7.1.0-1","7.1.0-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-41334.json"}},{"package":{"name":"astropy","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/astropy?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.2.1-2","5.3-1","5.3.1-1","5.3.1-2","5.3.2-1","5.3.3-1","5.3.4-1","5.3.4-2","5.3~rc1-1","6.0.0-1","6.0.0~rc1-1","6.0.0~rc2-1","6.0.0~rc2-2","6.0.1-1","6.0.1-2","6.0.1-3","6.0.1-4","6.1.1-1","6.1.2-1","6.1.3-1","6.1.4-1","6.1.4-2","6.1.5-1","6.1.5-2","7.0.0-1","7.0.0-2","7.0.0-3","7.0.0-4","7.0.0-5","7.0.0~rc1-1","7.0.1-1","7.0.1-2","7.0.1-3","7.0.1-4","7.0.1-5","7.1.0-1","7.1.0-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-41334.json"}},{"package":{"name":"astropy","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/astropy?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.3.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-41334.json"}},{"package":{"name":"astropy","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/astropy?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.3.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-41334.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-41334"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
