This flaw allows an attacker who can provide a crafted input file to cairo's image-compositor (for example, by convincing a user to open a file in an application using cairo, or if an application uses cairo on untrusted input) to cause a stack buffer overflow -> out-of-bounds WRITE. The highest impact from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"Cairo_jll","ecosystem":"Julia","purl":"pkg:julia/Cairo_jll?uuid=83423d85-b0ee-5818-9007-b63ccbeb887a"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.18.0+0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/SecurityAdvisories.jl/tree/generated/osv/2025/JLSEC-2025-17.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1898396"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202305-21"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC-BY-4.0","sources":[{"html_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35492","id":"CVE-2020-35492","imported":"2025-10-09T21:00:34.751Z","modified":"2024-11-21T05:27:24.803Z","published":"2021-03-18T19:15:13.230Z","url":"https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2020-35492"}]}}
