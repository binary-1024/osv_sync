In versions up to and including 1.1.1 the `org.conroller.js` code would erroneously log user secrets. This has been resolved in commit `46d98f2b` and should be available in subsequent versions of the software. Users of the software are advised to manually apply the `46d98f2b` commit or to update when a new version becomes available. As a workaround users should inspect their logs and remove logged secrets as appropriate.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-24875.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1.1.1"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/security/advisories/GHSA-rhj9-qx37-7m2m"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/commit/46d98f2b1427fc6ba1c2bc443dc6688fd400f1f4"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
