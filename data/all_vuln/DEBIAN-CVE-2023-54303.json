However bpf_perf_event_output can be also called from uprobes context through bpf_prog_run_array_sleepable function which disables migration, but keeps preemption enabled.  This can cause task to be preempted by another one inside the nesting protection and lead eventually to two tasks using same perf_sample_data buffer and cause crashes like:    kernel tried to execute NX-protected page - exploit attempt?
