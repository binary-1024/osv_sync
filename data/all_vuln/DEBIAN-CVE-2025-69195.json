This vulnerability, a stack-based buffer overflow, occurs in the filename sanitization logic when processing attacker-controlled URL paths, particularly when filename restriction options are active. A remote attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted URL, which, upon user interaction with wget2, can lead to memory corruption. This can cause the application to crash and potentially allow for further malicious activities.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wget2","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/wget2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.2.0+ds-1","2.2.0+ds-2","2.2.0+ds-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-69195.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wget2","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/wget2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.2.0+ds-3"}]}],"versions":["2.2.0+ds-1","2.2.0+ds-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-69195.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-69195"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H"}]}
