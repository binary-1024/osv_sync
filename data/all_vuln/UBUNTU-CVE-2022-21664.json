Due to lack of proper sanitization in one of the classes, there's potential for unintended SQL queries to be executed. This has been patched in WordPress version 5.8.3. Older affected versions are also fixed via security release, that go back till 4.1.34. We strongly recommend that you keep auto-updates enabled. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wordpress","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/wordpress@4.4.2+dfsg-1ubuntu1?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.3+dfsg-1","4.3.1+dfsg-1","4.4+dfsg-1","4.4.1+dfsg-1","4.4.2+dfsg-1","4.4.2+dfsg-1ubuntu1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"wordpress","binary_version":"4.4.2+dfsg-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-l10n","binary_version":"4.4.2+dfsg-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-theme-twentyfifteen","binary_version":"4.4.2+dfsg-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-theme-twentyfourteen","binary_version":"4.4.2+dfsg-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-theme-twentysixteen","binary_version":"4.4.2+dfsg-1ubuntu1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2022/UBUNTU-CVE-2022-21664.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wordpress","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/wordpress@4.9.5+dfsg1-1?arch=source&distro=bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.8.2+dfsg-2","4.8.3+dfsg-1","4.9.1+dfsg-1","4.9.2+dfsg-1","4.9.4+dfsg-1","4.9.5+dfsg1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"wordpress","binary_version":"4.9.5+dfsg1-1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-l10n","binary_version":"4.9.5+dfsg1-1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-theme-twentyfifteen","binary_version":"4.9.5+dfsg1-1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-theme-twentyseventeen","binary_version":"4.9.5+dfsg1-1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-theme-twentysixteen","binary_version":"4.9.5+dfsg1-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2022/UBUNTU-CVE-2022-21664.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wordpress","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:20.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/wordpress@5.3.2+dfsg1-1ubuntu1?arch=source&distro=focal"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.2.2+dfsg1-1","5.2.4+dfsg1-1","5.3.2+dfsg1-1","5.3.2+dfsg1-1ubuntu1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"wordpress","binary_version":"5.3.2+dfsg1-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-l10n","binary_version":"5.3.2+dfsg1-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-theme-twentynineteen","binary_version":"5.3.2+dfsg1-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-theme-twentyseventeen","binary_version":"5.3.2+dfsg1-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-theme-twentysixteen","binary_version":"5.3.2+dfsg1-1ubuntu1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2022/UBUNTU-CVE-2022-21664.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-21664"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/01/wordpress-5-8-3-security-release/"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/security/advisories/GHSA-jp3p-gw8h-6x86"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/commit/c09ccfbc547d75b392dbccc1ef0b4442ccd3c957"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5039"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21664"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"},{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
