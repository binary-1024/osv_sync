If this is a ftrace-based probe, there is a problem. In later calls to disarm_kprobe(), we will use kprobe_ftrace_ops because post_handler is NULL. But we're armed with kprobe_ipmodify_ops. This triggers a WARN in __disarm_kprobe_ftrace() and may even cause use-after-free:    Failed to disarm kprobe-ftrace at kernel_clone+0x0/0x3c0 (error -2)   WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 137 at kernel/kprobes.c:1135 __disarm_kprobe_ftrace.isra.21+0xcf/0xe0   Modules linked in: testKprobe_007(-)   CPU: 5 PID: 137 Comm: rmmod Not tainted 6.1.0-rc4-dirty #18   [...]   Call Trace:    <TASK>    __disable_kprobe+0xcd/0xe0    __unregister_kprobe_top+0x12/0x150    ? mutex_lock+0xe/0x30    unregister_kprobes.part.23+0x31/0xa0    unregister_kprobe+0x32/0x40    __x64_sys_delete_module+0x15e/0x260    ? do_user_addr_fault+0x2cd/0x6b0    do_syscall_64+0x3a/0x90    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd    [...]  For the kprobe-on-ftrace case, we keep the post_handler setting to identify this aggrprobe armed with kprobe_ipmodify_ops.
