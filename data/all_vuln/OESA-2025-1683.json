This permits a maliciously crafted input containing very long lines to cause allocation of arbitrarily large amounts of memory, potentially leading to memory exhaustion. With fix, the ParseMultipartForm function now correctly limits the maximum size of form lines.(CVE-2023-45290)\n\nVerifying a certificate chain which contains a certificate with an unknown public key algorithm will cause Certificate.Verify to panic. This affects all crypto/tls clients, and servers that set Config.ClientAuth to VerifyClientCertIfGiven or RequireAndVerifyClientCert. The default behavior is for TLS servers to not verify client certificates.(CVE-2024-24783)\n\nIf errors returned from MarshalJSON methods contain user controlled data, they may be used to break the contextual auto-escaping behavior of the html/template package, allowing for subsequent actions to inject unexpected content into templates.(CVE-2024-24785)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"etcd","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/etcd&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.4.14-16.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["etcd-3.4.14-16.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["etcd-3.4.14-16.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["etcd-3.4.14-16.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1683.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-1683"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45290"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24783"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24785"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
