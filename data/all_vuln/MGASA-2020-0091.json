  "details": "Updated thunderbird packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nWhen deriving an identifier for an email message, uninitialized memory was\nused in addition to the message contents (CVE-2020-6792).\n\nWhen processing an email message with an ill-formed envelope, Thunderbird\ncould read data from a random memory location (CVE-2020-6793).\n\nIf a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 60 and then later set a master\npassword, an unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. This\nis because the older stored password file was not deleted when the data was\ncopied to a new format starting in Thunderbird 60. The new master password is\nadded only on the new file. This could allow the exposure of stored password\ndata outside of user expectations (CVE-2020-6794).\n\nWhen processing a message that contains multiple S/MIME signatures, a bug in\nthe MIME processing code caused a null pointer dereference, leading to an\nunexploitable crash (CVE-2020-6795).\n\nIf a <template> tag was used in a <select> tag, the parser could be confused\nand allow JavaScript parsing and execution when it should not be allowed. A\nsite that relied on the browser behaving correctly could suffer a cross-site\nscripting vulnerability as a result (CVE-2020-6798).\n\nMemory safety bugs present in Thunderbird ESR 68.4. Some of these bugs showed\nevidence of memory corruption and presumably some of these could have been\nexploited to run arbitrary code (CVE-2020-6800).\n",
