Assimp aims to provide a full asset conversion pipeline for use in game engines and real-time rendering systems of any kind, but is not limited to this purpose.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability has been found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3 and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function Assimp::CSMImporter::InternReadFile of the file code/AssetLib/CSM/CSMLoader.cpp of the component CSM File Handler. The manipulation of the argument na leads to out-of-bounds read. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.(CVE-2025-2751)\n\nA vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. Affected by this issue is the function Assimp::LWO::AnimResolver::UpdateAnimRangeSetup of the file code/AssetLib/LWO/LWOAnimation.cpp of the component LWO File Handler. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.(CVE-2025-3158)\n\nA vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. Affected is the function Assimp::MD2Importer::InternReadFile in the library code/AssetLib/MD2/MD2Loader.cpp of the component Malformed File Handler. The manipulation of the argument Name leads to stack-based buffer overflow. The attack needs to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.(CVE-2025-3196)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"assimp","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/assimp&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.3.1-10.oe2403sp2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["assimp-5.3.1-10.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","assimp-debuginfo-5.3.1-10.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","assimp-debugsource-5.3.1-10.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","assimp-devel-5.3.1-10.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["assimp-help-5.3.1-10.oe2403sp2.noarch.rpm","python3-assimp-5.3.1-10.oe2403sp2.noarch.rpm"],"src":["assimp-5.3.1-10.oe2403sp2.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["assimp-5.3.1-10.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","assimp-debuginfo-5.3.1-10.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","assimp-debugsource-5.3.1-10.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","assimp-devel-5.3.1-10.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2178.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2178"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-2751"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-3158"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-3196"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
