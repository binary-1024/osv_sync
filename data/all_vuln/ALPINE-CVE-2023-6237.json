{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2023-6237","published":"2024-04-25T07:15:45.270Z","modified":"2025-11-19T06:20:48.791272Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-6237"],"details":"Issue summary: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may take\na long time.\n\nImpact summary: Applications that use the function EVP_PKEY_public_check()\nto check RSA public keys may experience long delays. Where the key that\nis being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead\nto a Denial of Service.\n\nWhen function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys,\na computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite.\nFor valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this\ncomputation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime,\nthen this computation would take a long time.\n\nAn application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies an RSA key\nobtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service\nattack.\n\nThe function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL\nfunctions however it is called from the OpenSSL pkey command line\napplication. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used\nwith the '-pubin' and '-check' options on untrusted data.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"openssl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/openssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.0.12-r3"}]}],"versions":["1.1.1-r0","1.1.1-r1","1.1.1-r2","1.1.1-r3","1.1.1-r4","1.1.1-r5","1.1.1a-r0","1.1.1a-r1","1.1.1b-r0","1.1.1b-r1","1.1.1c-r0","1.1.1c-r1","1.1.1d-r1","1.1.1d-r2","1.1.1d-r3","1.1.1d-r4","1.1.1d-r5","1.1.1e-r0","1.1.1f-r0","1.1.1g-r0","1.1.1h-r0","1.1.1i-r0","1.1.1j-r0","1.1.1k-r0","1.1.1k-r1","1.1.1l-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.0-r2","3.0.0-r3","3.0.0-r4","3.0.1-r0","3.0.1-r1","3.0.10-r0","3.0.11-r0","3.0.12-r0","3.0.12-r1","3.0.12-r2","3.0.2-r0","3.0.3-r0","3.0.5-r0","3.0.5-r1","3.0.5-r2","3.0.5-r3","3.0.6-r0","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r2","3.0.8-r0","3.0.8-r1","3.0.8-r2","3.0.8-r3","3.0.8-r4","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.0.9-r2","3.0.9-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-6237.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openssl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/openssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.4-r4"}]}],"versions":["1.1.1-r0","1.1.1-r1","1.1.1-r2","1.1.1-r3","1.1.1-r4","1.1.1-r5","1.1.1a-r0","1.1.1a-r1","1.1.1b-r0","1.1.1b-r1","1.1.1c-r0","1.1.1c-r1","1.1.1d-r1","1.1.1d-r2","1.1.1d-r3","1.1.1d-r4","1.1.1d-r5","1.1.1e-r0","1.1.1f-r0","1.1.1g-r0","1.1.1h-r0","1.1.1i-r0","1.1.1j-r0","1.1.1k-r0","1.1.1k-r1","1.1.1l-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.0-r2","3.0.0-r3","3.0.0-r4","3.0.1-r0","3.0.1-r1","3.0.2-r0","3.0.3-r0","3.0.5-r0","3.0.5-r1","3.0.5-r2","3.0.5-r3","3.0.6-r0","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.7-r2","3.0.8-r0","3.0.8-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.0-r1","3.1.0-r2","3.1.0-r3","3.1.0-r4","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.1-r3","3.1.2-r0","3.1.3-r0","3.1.4-r0","3.1.4-r1","3.1.4-r2","3.1.4-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-6237.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openssl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/openssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.4-r4"}]}],"versions":["1.1.1-r0","1.1.1-r1","1.1.1-r2","1.1.1-r3","1.1.1-r4","1.1.1-r5","1.1.1a-r0","1.1.1a-r1","1.1.1b-r0","1.1.1b-r1","1.1.1c-r0","1.1.1c-r1","1.1.1d-r1","1.1.1d-r2","1.1.1d-r3","1.1.1d-r4","1.1.1d-r5","1.1.1e-r0","1.1.1f-r0","1.1.1g-r0","1.1.1h-r0","1.1.1i-r0","1.1.1j-r0","1.1.1k-r0","1.1.1k-r1","1.1.1l-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.0-r2","3.0.0-r3","3.0.0-r4","3.0.1-r0","3.0.1-r1","3.0.2-r0","3.0.3-r0","3.0.5-r0","3.0.5-r1","3.0.5-r2","3.0.5-r3","3.0.6-r0","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.7-r2","3.0.8-r0","3.0.8-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.0-r1","3.1.0-r2","3.1.0-r3","3.1.0-r4","3.1.0-r5","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.1-r3","3.1.2-r0","3.1.3-r0","3.1.4-r0","3.1.4-r1","3.1.4-r2","3.1.4-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-6237.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openssl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/openssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.4-r4"}]}],"versions":["1.1.1-r0","1.1.1-r1","1.1.1-r2","1.1.1-r3","1.1.1-r4","1.1.1-r5","1.1.1a-r0","1.1.1a-r1","1.1.1b-r0","1.1.1b-r1","1.1.1c-r0","1.1.1c-r1","1.1.1d-r1","1.1.1d-r2","1.1.1d-r3","1.1.1d-r4","1.1.1d-r5","1.1.1e-r0","1.1.1f-r0","1.1.1g-r0","1.1.1h-r0","1.1.1i-r0","1.1.1j-r0","1.1.1k-r0","1.1.1k-r1","1.1.1l-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.0-r2","3.0.0-r3","3.0.0-r4","3.0.1-r0","3.0.1-r1","3.0.2-r0","3.0.3-r0","3.0.5-r0","3.0.5-r1","3.0.5-r2","3.0.5-r3","3.0.6-r0","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.7-r2","3.0.8-r0","3.0.8-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.0-r1","3.1.0-r2","3.1.0-r3","3.1.0-r4","3.1.0-r5","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.1-r3","3.1.2-r0","3.1.3-r0","3.1.4-r0","3.1.4-r1","3.1.4-r2","3.1.4-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-6237.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openssl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/openssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.4-r4"}]}],"versions":["1.1.1-r0","1.1.1-r1","1.1.1-r2","1.1.1-r3","1.1.1-r4","1.1.1-r5","1.1.1a-r0","1.1.1a-r1","1.1.1b-r0","1.1.1b-r1","1.1.1c-r0","1.1.1c-r1","1.1.1d-r1","1.1.1d-r2","1.1.1d-r3","1.1.1d-r4","1.1.1d-r5","1.1.1e-r0","1.1.1f-r0","1.1.1g-r0","1.1.1h-r0","1.1.1i-r0","1.1.1j-r0","1.1.1k-r0","1.1.1k-r1","1.1.1l-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.0-r2","3.0.0-r3","3.0.0-r4","3.0.1-r0","3.0.1-r1","3.0.2-r0","3.0.3-r0","3.0.5-r0","3.0.5-r1","3.0.5-r2","3.0.5-r3","3.0.6-r0","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.7-r2","3.0.8-r0","3.0.8-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.0-r1","3.1.0-r2","3.1.0-r3","3.1.0-r4","3.1.0-r5","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.1-r3","3.1.2-r0","3.1.3-r0","3.1.4-r0","3.1.4-r1","3.1.4-r2","3.1.4-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-6237.json"}},{"package":{"na
