This patch addresses the following concerns.  Ensure that there is enough space for at least one header so that we don't have a negative size later.  \tif (msg_hdr_len < sizeof(*trans_hdr))  Ensure that we have enough space to read the next header from the msg->data.  \tif (msg_len > msg_hdr_len - sizeof(*trans_hdr)) \t\treturn -EINVAL;  Check that the trans_hdr->len is not below the minimum size:  \tif (hdr_len < sizeof(*trans_hdr))  This minimum check ensures that we don't corrupt memory in decode_passthrough() when we do.  \tmemcpy(out_trans->data, in_trans->data, len - sizeof(in_trans->hdr));  And finally, use size_add() to prevent an integer overflow:  \tif (size_add(msg_len, hdr_len) > msg_hdr_len)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.4.11-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53493.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.4.11-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53493.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-53493"}]}
