An attacker-defined callback could run during js_print_value, during which the array could get resized and len1 become out of bounds. This results in a use-after-free.A second instance occurs in the same function during printing of a map or set objects. The code iterates over ms->records list, but once again, elements could be removed from the list during js_print_value call.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"quickjs","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:Pro:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/quickjs@2021.03.27-1ubuntu0.1~esm1?arch=source&distro=esm-apps/noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2021.03.27-1","2021.03.27-1ubuntu0.1~esm1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"libquickjs","binary_version":"2021.03.27-1ubuntu0.1~esm1"},{"binary_name":"quickjs","binary_version":"2021.03.27-1ubuntu0.1~esm1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-62490.json"}},{"package":{"name":"quickjs","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.10","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/quickjs@2025.04.26-1?arch=source&distro=questing"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2024.01.13-5","2025.04.26-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"libquickjs","binary_version":"2025.04.26-1"},{"binary_name":"quickjs","binary_version":"2025.04.26-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-62490.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-62490"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62490"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://issuetracker.google.com/434196651"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bellard.org/quickjs/Changelog"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:H/SI:H/SA:L"},{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
