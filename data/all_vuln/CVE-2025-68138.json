In libocpp prior to version 0.30.1, pointers returned by the `strdup` calls are never freed. At each connection attempt, the newly allocated memory area will be leaked, potentially causing memory exhaustion and denial of service. Version 0.30.1 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/everest/libocpp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"157ba65d9487c149dcd0ed31179a738c4b5ca343"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"libocpp < 0.30.1"}]}}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.14.0","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.16.2","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.17.2","v0.18.0","v0.19.0","v0.2.0","v0.20.0","v0.21.0","v0.22.0","v0.23.0","v0.24.1","v0.24.2","v0.25.0","v0.26.0","v0.26.1","v0.26.2","v0.26.3","v0.27.0","v0.27.1","v0.28.0","v0.29.0","v0.3.0","v0.30.0","v0.30.1","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.6.1","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.5","v0.8.6","v0.8.7","v0.9.3","v0.9.4","v0.9.5","v0.9.6","v0.9.7","v0.9.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68138.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68138.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core/security/advisories/GHSA-f8c2-44c3-7v55"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/EVerest/libocpp/blob/89c7b62ec899db637f43b54f19af2c4af30cfa66/lib/ocpp/common/websocket/websocket_libwebsockets.cpp"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68138"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-770"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68138.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
