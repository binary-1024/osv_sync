  "details": "This update for the Linux Kernel 4.12.14-23 fixes several issues.\n\nThe following security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2018-5391: Fixed a denial of service attack with low rates of specially modified packets targeting IP fragment re-assembly. An attacker may have caused a denial of service condition by sending specially crafted IP fragments. The current vulnerability (CVE-2018-5391) became exploitable in the Linux kernel with the increase of the IP fragment reassembly queue size (bsc#1103098).\n- CVE-2018-18386: The drivers/tty/n_tty.c allowed local attackers (who are able to access pseudo terminals) to hang/block further usage of any pseudo terminal devices due to an EXTPROC versus ICANON confusion in TIOCINQ (bsc#1112039).\n",
