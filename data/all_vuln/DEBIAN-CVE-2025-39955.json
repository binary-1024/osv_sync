[0]  syzbot reused the server-side TCP Fast Open socket as a new client before the TFO socket completes 3WHS:    1. accept()   2. connect(AF_UNSPEC)   3. connect() to another destination  As of accept(), sk->sk_state is TCP_SYN_RECV, and tcp_disconnect() changes it to TCP_CLOSE and makes connect() possible, which restarts timers.  Since tcp_disconnect() forgot to clear tcp_sk(sk)->fastopen_rsk, the retransmit timer triggered the warning and the intended packet was not retransmitted.  Let's call reqsk_fastopen_remove() in tcp_disconnect().
