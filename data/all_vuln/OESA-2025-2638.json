This results in a buffer over-read when NPN is used (see CVE-2024-5535 for OpenSSL). This vulnerability is of low severity due to NPN being not widely used and specifying an empty list likely being uncommon in-practice (typically a protocol name would be configured).(CVE-2024-5642)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python3&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.9.9-48.oe2203sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python3-3.9.9-48.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-debug-3.9.9-48.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.9.9-48.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.9.9-48.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-devel-3.9.9-48.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-unversioned-command-3.9.9-48.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["python3-help-3.9.9-48.oe2203sp4.noarch.rpm"],"src":["python3-3.9.9-48.oe2203sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python3-3.9.9-48.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-debug-3.9.9-48.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.9.9-48.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.9.9-48.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-devel-3.9.9-48.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-unversioned-command-3.9.9-48.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2638.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2638"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5642"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
