{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-45288","published":"2024-04-04T21:15:16Z","modified":"2025-10-14T04:25:38.930198Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-45288"],"details":"An attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames. Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"golang-1.15","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-1.15?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.15.15-1","1.15.15-1~deb11u1","1.15.15-1~deb11u2","1.15.15-1~deb11u3","1.15.15-1~deb11u4","1.15.15-2","1.15.15-3","1.15.15-4","1.15.15-5","1.15.9-6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-45288.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-1.19","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-1.19?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.19.10-1","1.19.10-2","1.19.11-1","1.19.12-1","1.19.12-2","1.19.12-2~bpo11+1","1.19.12-2~bpo12+1","1.19.13-1","1.19.13-1~bpo11+1","1.19.13-1~bpo12+1","1.19.8-2","1.19.9-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-45288.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-golang-x-net","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-golang-x-net?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:0.0+git20210119.5f4716e+dfsg-4","1:0.0+git20210805.aaa1db6+dfsg-1","1:0.0+git20211209.491a49a+dfsg-1","1:0.0+git20211209.491a49a+dfsg-1~bpo11+1","1:0.0+git20220225.27dd868+dfsg-1","1:0.0+git20220531.c960675+dfsg-1","1:0.0+git20220624.1bab6f3+dfsg-1","1:0.0+git20220728.c7608f3+dfsg-1","1:0.0+git20220728.c7608f3+dfsg-2","1:0.0+git20220728.c7608f3+dfsg-2~bpo11+1","1:0.0+git20221012.0b7e1fb+dfsg-1","1:0.0+git20221012.0b7e1fb+dfsg-1~bpo11+1","1:0.1.0+dfsg-1","1:0.10.0-1","1:0.11.0-1","1:0.14.0-1","1:0.15.0-1","1:0.15.0-2","1:0.17.0+dfsg-1","1:0.19.0+dfsg-1","1:0.20.0+dfsg-1","1:0.21.0+dfsg-1","1:0.22.0+dfsg-1","1:0.23.0+dfsg-1","1:0.24.0+dfsg-1","1:0.25.0+dfsg-1","1:0.26.0+dfsg-1","1:0.26.0+dfsg-2","1:0.27.0-1","1:0.27.0-2","1:0.4.0+dfsg-1","1:0.7.0+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-45288.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-golang-x-net","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-golang-x-net?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:0.10.0-1","1:0.11.0-1","1:0.14.0-1","1:0.15.0-1","1:0.15.0-2","1:0.17.0+dfsg-1","1:0.19.0+dfsg-1","1:0.20.0+dfsg-1","1:0.21.0+dfsg-1","1:0.22.0+dfsg-1","1:0.23.0+dfsg-1","1:0.24.0+dfsg-1","1:0.25.0+dfsg-1","1:0.26.0+dfsg-1","1:0.26.0+dfsg-2","1:0.27.0-1","1:0.27.0-2","1:0.7.0+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-45288.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-golang-x-net","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-golang-x-net?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:0.23.0+dfsg-"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-45288.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-golang-x-net","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-golang-x-net?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:0.23.0+dfsg-"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-45288.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-45288"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
