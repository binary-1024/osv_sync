There is a variable \"dbentry->n_key_data\" in kadmin/dbutil/dump.c that can store 16-bit data but unknowingly the developer has assigned a \"u4\" variable to it, which is for 32-bit data. An attacker can use this vulnerability to affect other artifacts of the database as we know that a Kerberos database dump file contains trusted data.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"krb5","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/krb5?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.18.3-6","1.18.3-6+deb11u1","1.18.3-6+deb11u2","1.18.3-6+deb11u3","1.18.3-6+deb11u4","1.18.3-6+deb11u5","1.18.3-6+deb11u6","1.18.3-6+deb11u7","1.18.3-7","1.19.2-1","1.19.2-2","1.20-1","1.20.1-1","1.20.1-2","1.20.1-2+loong64","1.20.1-3","1.20.1-4","1.20.1-5","1.20.1-5.1","1.20.1-5.1~exp1","1.20.1-6","1.20~beta1-1","1.21.2-1","1.21.3-1","1.21.3-2","1.21.3-3","1.21.3-4","1.21.3-5"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-5709.json"}},{"package":{"name":"krb5","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/krb5?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.20.1-2","1.20.1-2+deb12u1","1.20.1-2+deb12u2","1.20.1-2+deb12u3","1.20.1-2+deb12u4","1.20.1-2+loong64","1.20.1-3","1.20.1-4","1.20.1-5","1.20.1-5.1","1.20.1-5.1~exp1","1.20.1-6","1.21.2-1","1.21.3-1","1.21.3-2","1.21.3-3","1.21.3-4","1.21.3-5"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-5709.json"}},{"package":{"name":"krb5","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/krb5?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.21.3-5"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-5709.json"}},{"package":{"name":"krb5","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/krb5?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.21.3-5"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-5709.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5709"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
