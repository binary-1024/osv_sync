  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda-ipc: Do not process IPC reply before firmware boot  It is not yet clear, but it is possible to create a firmware so broken that it will send a reply message before a FW_READY message (it is not yet clear if FW_READY will arrive later). Since the reply_data is allocated only after the FW_READY message, this will lead to a NULL pointer dereference if not filtered out.  The issue was reported with IPC4 firmware but the same condition is present for IPC3.",
