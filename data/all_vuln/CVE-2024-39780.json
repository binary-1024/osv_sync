The issue is caused by the use of the yaml.load() function in the 'set' and 'get' verbs, and allows for the creation of arbitrary Python objects. Through this flaw, a local or remote user can craft and execute arbitrary Python code.","references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ros/dynamic_reconfigure/pull/202"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
