However, successful exploitation may depend on the server configuration and whether the header is used in the application logic.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"golang-github-gin-gonic-gin","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-gin-gonic-gin?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.6.3-3","1.6.3-4","1.8.1-1","1.8.1-2","1.8.1-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-26125.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-gin-gonic-gin","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-gin-gonic-gin?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.8.1-1","1.8.1-2","1.8.1-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-26125.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-gin-gonic-gin","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-gin-gonic-gin?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.8.1-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-26125.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-gin-gonic-gin","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-gin-gonic-gin?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.8.1-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-26125.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-26125"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
