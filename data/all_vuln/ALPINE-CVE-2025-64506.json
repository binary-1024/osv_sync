From version 1.6.0 to before 1.6.51, a heap buffer over-read vulnerability exists in libpng's png_write_image_8bit function when processing 8-bit images through the simplified write API with convert_to_8bit enabled. The vulnerability affects 8-bit grayscale+alpha, RGB/RGBA, and images with incomplete row data. A conditional guard incorrectly allows 8-bit input to enter code expecting 16-bit input, causing reads up to 2 bytes beyond allocated buffer boundaries. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.51.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libpng","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libpng?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.6.51-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.34-r0","1.2.35-r0","1.2.36-r0","1.2.37-r0","1.2.38-r0","1.2.39-r0","1.2.40-r0","1.4.0-r0","1.4.1-r0","1.4.1-r1","1.4.2-r0","1.4.3-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.5.10-r0","1.5.11-r0","1.5.12-r0","1.5.13-r0","1.5.14-r0","1.5.15-r0","1.5.16-r0","1.5.17-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.5.2-r1","1.5.2-r2","1.5.4-r0","1.5.5-r0","1.5.5-r1","1.5.8-r0","1.5.9-r0","1.6.10-r0","1.6.12-r0","1.6.13-r0","1.6.14-r0","1.6.15-r0","1.6.16-r0","1.6.17-r0","1.6.18-r0","1.6.19-r0","1.6.20-r0","1.6.21-r0","1.6.22-r0","1.6.23-r0","1.6.23-r1","1.6.23-r2","1.6.24-r0","1.6.25-r0","1.6.26-r0","1.6.27-r0","1.6.27-r1","1.6.28-r0","1.6.29-r0","1.6.29-r1","1.6.3-r0","1.6.30-r0","1.6.31-r0","1.6.32-r0","1.6.34-r0","1.6.34-r1","1.6.35-r0","1.6.37-r0","1.6.37-r1","1.6.37-r2","1.6.38-r0","1.6.39-r0","1.6.39-r1","1.6.39-r2","1.6.39-r3","1.6.39-r4","1.6.40-r0","1.6.41-r0","1.6.42-r0","1.6.43-r0","1.6.44-r0","1.6.45-r0","1.6.46-r0","1.6.47-r0","1.6.5-r0","1.6.6-r0","1.6.7-r0","1.6.8-r0","1.6.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-64506.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2025-64506"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H"}]}
