{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-40294","published":"2025-12-08T01:16:01.423Z","modified":"2026-01-14T15:18:00.976852Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-40294"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: MGMT: Fix OOB access in parse_adv_monitor_pattern()  In the parse_adv_monitor_pattern() function, the value of the 'length' variable is currently limited to HCI_MAX_EXT_AD_LENGTH(251). The size of the 'value' array in the mgmt_adv_pattern structure is 31. If the value of 'pattern[i].length' is set in the user space and exceeds 31, the 'patterns[i].value' array can be accessed out of bound when copied.  Increasing the size of the 'value' array in the 'mgmt_adv_pattern' structure will break the userspace. Considering this, and to avoid OOB access revert the limits for 'offset' and 'length' back to the value of HCI_MAX_AD_LENGTH.
