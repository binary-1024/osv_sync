  "summary": "handcraftedinthealps/goodby-csv has Potential Gadget Chain allowing Remote Code Execution",
  "details": "### Impact\n\ngoodby-csv could be used as part of a chain of methods that is exploitable when an insecure deserialization vulnerability exists in an application. This so-called \"gadget chain\" presents no direct threat but is a vector that can be used to achieve remote code execution if the application deserializes untrusted data due to another vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\n\nHas the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?\n\nThe problem is patched with Version 1.4.3\n\n### Workarounds\n\nPatch `src/Goodby/CSV/Export/Standard/Collection /CallbackCollection.php`:\n\n```diff\n+    public function __wakeup() {\n+       throw new \\BadMethodCallException('Cannot unserialize ' . __CLASS__);\n+    }\n```\n\nHowever, this is not directly exploitable; a separate vulnerability must be present to allow an attacker to pass unsafe input to unserialize(). There are no such known exploits in goodby-csv.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_",
