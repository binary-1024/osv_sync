  "details": "Flatpak apps with direct access to AF_UNIX sockets such as those used by\nWayland, Pipewire or pipewire-pulse can trick portals and other host-OS\nservices into treating the Flatpak app as though it was an ordinary,\nnon-sandboxed host-OS process, by manipulating the VFS using recent\nmount-related syscalls that are not blocked by Flatpak's denylist seccomp\nfilter, in order to substitute a crafted /.flatpak-info or make that file\ndisappear entirely.\n",
