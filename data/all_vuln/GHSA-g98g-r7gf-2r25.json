  "details": "**Overview**\nSession cookies of applications using the Auth0-PHP SDK configured with CookieStore have authentication tags that can be brute forced, which may result in unauthorized access.\n\n**Am I Affected?**\nYou are affected by this vulnerability if you meet the following pre-conditions:\n1. Applications using the Auth0-PHP SDK, or the following SDKs that rely on the Auth0-PHP SDK:\n    a. Auth0/symfony,\n    b. Auth0/laravel-auth0,\n    c. Auth0/wordpress,\n2. Session storage configured with CookieStore.\n\n**Fix**\nUpgrade Auth0/Auth0-PHP to v8.14.0. As an additional precautionary measure, we recommend rotating your cookie encryption keys. Note that once updated, any previous session cookies will be rejected.\n\n**Acknowledgement**\nOkta would like to thank F\u00e9lix Charette for discovering this vulnerability.",
