  "details": "containerd is an open-source container runtime. A bug was found in\ncontainerd prior to versions 1.6.38, 1.7.27, and 2.0.4 where containers\nlaunched with a User set as a `UID:GID` larger than the maximum 32-bit\nsigned integer can cause an overflow condition where the container\nultimately runs as root (UID 0). This could cause unexpected behavior\nfor environments that require containers to run as a non-root user. This\nbug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.38, 1.7.27, and 2.04. As a\nworkaround, ensure that only trusted images are used and that only\ntrusted users have permissions to import images.\n",
