{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-22184","published":"2026-01-07T21:16:01.563Z","modified":"2026-01-17T05:40:50.365764Z","related":["CGA-4v8v-x7hx-h96w","MGASA-2026-0006"],"details":"zlib versions up to and including 1.3.1.2 include a global buffer overflow in the untgz utility located under contrib/untgz. The vulnerability is limited to the standalone demonstration utility and does not affect the core zlib compression library. The flaw occurs when a user executes the untgz command with an excessively long archive name supplied via the command line, leading to an out-of-bounds write in a fixed-size global buffer.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/madler/zlib","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"570720b0c24f9686c33f35a1b3165c1f568b96be"}]}],"versions":["v0.71","v0.79","v0.8","v0.9","v0.91","v0.92","v0.93","v0.94","v0.95","v0.99","v1.0-pre","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.7","v1.0.8","v1.0.9","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.2.0","v1.2.0.1","v1.2.0.2","v1.2.0.3","v1.2.0.4","v1.2.0.5","v1.2.0.6","v1.2.0.7","v1.2.0.8","v1.2.1","v1.2.1.1","v1.2.1.2","v1.2.10","v1.2.11","v1.2.12","v1.2.13","v1.2.2","v1.2.2.1","v1.2.2.2","v1.2.2.3","v1.2.2.4","v1.2.3","v1.2.3.1","v1.2.3.2","v1.2.3.3","v1.2.3.4","v1.2.3.5","v1.2.3.6","v1.2.3.7","v1.2.3.8","v1.2.3.9","v1.2.4","v1.2.4-pre1","v1.2.4-pre2","v1.2.4.1","v1.2.4.2","v1.2.4.3","v1.2.4.4","v1.2.4.5","v1.2.5","v1.2.5.1","v1.2.5.2","v1.2.5.3","v1.2.6","v1.2.6.1","v1.2.7","v1.2.7.1","v1.2.7.2","v1.2.7.3","v1.2.8","v1.2.9","v1.3","v1.3.1","v1.3.1.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22184.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://zlib.net/"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2026/Jan/3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/zlib-untgz-global-buffer-overflow-in-tgzfname"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/madler/zlib/issues/1142"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/madler/zlib"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
