NOTE: this is the documented behavior of AMD64 processors, but it is inconsistent with Intel processors in a security-relevant fashion that was not addressed by the kernels.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://secunia.com/advisories/55082"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://security.gentoo.org/glsa/glsa-201309-24.xml"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.debian.org/security/2014/dsa-3006"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2014-03/msg00021.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/06/03/1"}]}
