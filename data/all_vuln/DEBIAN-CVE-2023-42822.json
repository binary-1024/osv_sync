Access to the font glyphs in xrdp_painter.c is not bounds-checked . Since some of this data is controllable by the user, this can result in an out-of-bounds read within the xrdp executable. The vulnerability allows an out-of-bounds read within a potentially privileged process. On non-Debian platforms, xrdp tends to run as root. Potentially an out-of-bounds write can follow the out-of-bounds read. There is no denial-of-service impact, providing xrdp is running in forking mode. This issue has been addressed in release 0.9.23.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"xrdp","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xrdp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.9.21.1-1~deb11u2"}]}],"versions":["0.9.12-1.1","0.9.15-1","0.9.17-1","0.9.17-2","0.9.17-2.1","0.9.19-1","0.9.21.1-1~deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-42822.json"}},{"package":{"name":"xrdp","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xrdp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.10.0-1","0.10.0-2","0.10.0~beta1-1","0.10.0~beta1-2","0.10.0~beta2-1","0.10.1-1","0.10.1-2","0.10.1-3","0.10.1-3.1","0.10.2-1","0.10.2-2","0.10.4.1-1","0.10.4.1-2","0.9.21.1-1","0.9.21.1-1+deb12u1","0.9.24-1","0.9.24-2","0.9.24-3","0.9.24-4","0.9.24-5","0.9.24-5~bpo12+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-42822.json"}},{"package":{"name":"xrdp","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xrdp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.9.24-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-42822.json"}},{"package":{"name":"xrdp","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xrdp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.9.24-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-42822.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-42822"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
