This creates a non-mutexed and non-protected timeframe, when one instance is dereferencing and using &gdev->srcu, before the other has initialized it, resulting in crash:  [    4.935481] Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff800272bcc000 [    4.943396] Mem abort info: [    4.943400]   ESR = 0x0000000096000005 [    4.943403]   EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits [    4.943407]   SET = 0, FnV = 0 [    4.943410]   EA = 0, S1PTW = 0 [    4.943413]   FSC = 0x05: level 1 translation fault [    4.943416] Data abort info: [    4.943418]   ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000005, ISS2 = 0x00000000 [    4.946220]   CM = 0, WnR = 0, TnD = 0, TagAccess = 0 [    4.955261]   GCS = 0, Overlay = 0, DirtyBit = 0, Xs = 0 [    4.955268] swapper pgtable: 4k pages, 48-bit VAs, pgdp=0000000038e6c000 [    4.961449] [ffff800272bcc000] pgd=0000000000000000 [    4.969203] , p4d=1000000039739003 [    4.979730] , pud=0000000000000000 [    4.980210] phandle (CPU): 0x0000005e, phandle (BE): 0x5e000000 for node \"reset\" [    4.991736] Internal error: Oops: 0000000096000005 [#1] PREEMPT SMP ...
