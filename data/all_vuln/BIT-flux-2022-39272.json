Versions prior to 0.35.0 are subject to a Denial of Service. Users that have permissions to change Flux’s objects, either through a Flux source or directly within a cluster, can provide invalid data to fields `.spec.interval` or `.spec.timeout` (and structured variations of these fields), causing the entire object type to stop being processed. This issue is patched in version 0.35.0. As a workaround, Admission controllers can be employed to restrict the values that can be used for fields `.spec.interval` and `.spec.timeout`, however upgrading to the latest versions is still the recommended mitigation.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"flux","ecosystem":"Bitnami","purl":"pkg:bitnami/flux"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.1.0"},{"fixed":"0.35.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/bitnami/vulndb/tree/main/data/flux/BIT-flux-2022-39272.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/security/advisories/GHSA-f4p5-x4vc-mh4v"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery/issues/131"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39272"}],"database_specific":{"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:fluxcd:flux2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"severity":"Medium"}}
