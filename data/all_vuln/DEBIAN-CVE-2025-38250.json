{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-38250","published":"2025-07-09T11:15:27Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:20:53.540278Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-38250"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: hci_core: Fix use-after-free in vhci_flush()  syzbot reported use-after-free in vhci_flush() without repro. [0]  From the splat, a thread close()d a vhci file descriptor while its device was being used by iotcl() on another thread.  Once the last fd refcnt is released, vhci_release() calls hci_unregister_dev(), hci_free_dev(), and kfree() for struct vhci_data, which is set to hci_dev->dev->driver_data.  The problem is that there is no synchronisation after unlinking hdev from hci_dev_list in hci_unregister_dev().  There might be another thread still accessing the hdev which was fetched before the unlink operation.  We can use SRCU for such synchronisation.  Let's run hci_dev_reset() under SRCU and wait for its completion in hci_unregister_dev().  Another option would be to restore hci_dev->destruct(), which was removed in commit 587ae086f6e4 (\"Bluetooth: Remove unused hci-destruct cb\").  However, this would not be a good solution, as we should not run hci_unregister_dev() while there are in-flight ioctl() requests, which could lead to another data-race KCSAN splat.  Note that other drivers seem to have the same problem, for exmaple, virtbt_remove().
