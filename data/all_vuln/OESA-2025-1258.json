Its functionality can be enhanced via a plethora of extensions.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nOn Windows 10, when using the &apos;Save As&apos; functionality, an attacker could have tricked the browser into saving the file with a disallowed extension such as `.url` by including an invalid character in the extension. *Note:* This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 127, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.12, and Thunderbird &lt; 115.12.(CVE-2024-5692)\n\nIn an out-of-memory scenario an allocation could fail but free would have been called on the pointer afterwards leading to memory corruption. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 128, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.13, Thunderbird &lt; 115.13, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.(CVE-2024-6603)",
