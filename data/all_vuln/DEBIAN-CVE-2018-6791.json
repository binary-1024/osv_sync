When a vfat thumbdrive that contains `` or $() in its volume label is plugged in and mounted through the device notifier, it's interpreted as a shell command, leading to a possibility of arbitrary command execution. An example of an offending volume label is \"$(touch b)\" -- this will create a file called b in the home folder.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"plasma-workspace","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/plasma-workspace?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4:5.12.0-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-6791.json"}},{"package":{"name":"plasma-workspace","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/plasma-workspace?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4:5.12.0-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-6791.json"}},{"package":{"name":"plasma-workspace","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/plasma-workspace?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4:5.12.0-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-6791.json"}},{"package":{"name":"plasma-workspace","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/plasma-workspace?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4:5.12.0-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-6791.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6791"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
