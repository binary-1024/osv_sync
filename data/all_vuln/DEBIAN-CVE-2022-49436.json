{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49436","published":"2025-02-26T07:01:20Z","modified":"2025-10-23T09:01:23Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-49436"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/papr_scm: Fix leaking nvdimm_events_map elements  Right now 'char *' elements allocated for individual 'stat_id' in 'papr_scm_priv.nvdimm_events_map[]' during papr_scm_pmu_check_events(), get leaked in papr_scm_remove() and papr_scm_pmu_register(), papr_scm_pmu_check_events() error paths.  Also individual 'stat_id' arent NULL terminated 'char *' instead they are fixed 8-byte sized identifiers. However papr_scm_pmu_register() assumes it to be a NULL terminated 'char *' and at other places it assumes it to be a 'papr_scm_perf_stat.stat_id' sized string which is 8-byes in size.  Fix this by allocating the memory for papr_scm_priv.nvdimm_events_map to also include space for 'stat_id' entries. This is possible since number of available events/stat_ids are known upfront. This saves some memory and one extra level of indirection from 'nvdimm_events_map' to 'stat_id'. Also rest of the code can continue to call 'kfree(papr_scm_priv.nvdimm_events_map)' without needing to iterate over the array and free up individual elements.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49436.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49436.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49436.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-49436"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
