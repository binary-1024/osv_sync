As a consequence, during the FreeIPA installation process, it inadvertently leaks the administrative user credentials, including the administrator password, to the journal database. In the worst-case scenario, where the journal log is centralized, users with access to it can have improper access to the FreeIPA administrator credentials.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"freeipa","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/freeipa?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.10.1+dfsg1-1+exp1","4.10.1-1+exp1","4.10.2-1","4.10.2-2","4.10.2-2+exp1","4.11.1-1","4.11.1-1+exp1","4.11.1-2","4.11.1-2+exp1","4.11.1-2.1","4.12.2-1","4.12.2-2","4.12.2-3","4.12.4-1","4.12.4-2","4.9.11-1","4.9.11-1+exp1","4.9.11-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-11029.json"}},{"package":{"name":"freeipa","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/freeipa?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.12.4-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-11029.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-11029"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
