  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfs: Fix enomem handling in buffered reads  If netfs_read_to_pagecache() gets an error from either ->prepare_read() or from netfs_prepare_read_iterator(), it needs to decrement ->nr_outstanding, cancel the subrequest and break out of the issuing loop.  Currently, it only does this for two of the cases, but there are two more that aren't handled.  Fix this by moving the handling to a common place and jumping to it from all four places.  This is in preference to inserting a wrapper around netfs_prepare_read_iterator() as proposed by Dmitry Antipov[1].",
