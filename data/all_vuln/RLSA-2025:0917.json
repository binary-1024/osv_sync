  "details": "The keepalived utility provides simple and robust facilities for load balancing and high availability. The load balancing framework relies on the well-known and widely used IP Virtual Server (IPVS) kernel module providing layer-4 (transport layer) load balancing. Keepalived implements a set of checkers to dynamically and adaptively maintain and manage a load balanced server pool according to the health of the servers. Keepalived also implements the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRPv2) to achieve high availability with director failover.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* keepalived: Integer overflow vulnerability in vrrp_ipsets_handler (CVE-2024-41184)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.",
