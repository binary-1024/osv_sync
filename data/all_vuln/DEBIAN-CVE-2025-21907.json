{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-21907","published":"2025-04-01T16:15:21Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:20:16.603973Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-21907"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: memory-failure: update ttu flag inside unmap_poisoned_folio  Patch series \"mm: memory_failure: unmap poisoned folio during migrate properly\", v3.  Fix two bugs during folio migration if the folio is poisoned.   This patch (of 3):  Commit 6da6b1d4a7df (\"mm/hwpoison: convert TTU_IGNORE_HWPOISON to TTU_HWPOISON\") introduce TTU_HWPOISON to replace TTU_IGNORE_HWPOISON in order to stop send SIGBUS signal when accessing an error page after a memory error on a clean folio.  However during page migration, anon folio must be set with TTU_HWPOISON during unmap_*().  For pagecache we need some policy just like the one in hwpoison_user_mappings to set this flag.  So move this policy from hwpoison_user_mappings to unmap_poisoned_folio to handle this warning properly.  Warning will be produced during unamp poison folio with the following log:    ------------[ cut here ]------------   WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 365 at mm/rmap.c:1847 try_to_unmap_one+0x8fc/0xd3c   Modules
