  "details": "Qt (pronounced as &quot;cute&quot;, not &quot;cu-tee&quot;) is a cross-platform framework that is usually used as a graphical toolkit, although it is also very helpful in creating CLI applications. It runs on the three major desktop OSes, as well as on mobile OSes, such as Symbian, Nokia Belle, Meego Harmattan, MeeGo or BB10, and on embedded devices. Ports for Android (Necessitas) and iOS are also in development\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Qt before 5.15.15, 6.x before 6.2.9, and 6.3.x through 6.5.x before 6.5.2. Certificate validation for TLS does not always consider whether the root of a chain is a configured CA certificate.(CVE-2023-34410)",
