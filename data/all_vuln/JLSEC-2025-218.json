In some configurations, an unauthenticated attacker can send an invalid ClientHello message to a DTLS server that causes a heap-based buffer over-read of up to 255 bytes. This can cause a server crash or possibly information disclosure based on error responses. Affected configurations have MBEDTLS_SSL_DTLS_CLIENT_PORT_REUSE enabled and MBEDTLS_SSL_IN_CONTENT_LEN less than a threshold that depends on the configuration: 258 bytes if using mbedtls_ssl_cookie_check, and possibly up to 571 bytes with a custom cookie check function.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"MbedTLS_jll","ecosystem":"Julia","purl":"pkg:julia/MbedTLS_jll?uuid=c8ffd9c3-330d-5841-b78e-0817d7145fa1"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.28.2+0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/SecurityAdvisories.jl/tree/generated/osv/2025/JLSEC-2025-218.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/releases"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00036.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://mbed-tls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-advisories/advisories/mbedtls-security-advisory-2022-07.html"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC-BY-4.0","sources":[{"html_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35409","id":"CVE-2022-35409","imported":"2025-11-20T23:04:02.017Z","modified":"2024-11-21T07:11:07.183Z","published":"2022-07-15T14:15:09.840Z","url":"https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2022-35409"}]}}
