In versions prior to 2.4.9.4, the 3rd-party init SSO functionality of mod_auth_openidc was reported to be vulnerable to an open redirect attack by supplying a crafted URL in the `target_link_uri` parameter. A patch in version 2.4.9.4 made it so that the `OIDCRedirectURLsAllowed` setting must be applied to the `target_link_uri` parameter. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading to a patched version.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libapache2-mod-auth-openidc","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libapache2-mod-auth-openidc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.9.4-0+deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["2.4.9-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-39191.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libapache2-mod-auth-openidc","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libapache2-mod-auth-openidc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.9.4-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-39191.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libapache2-mod-auth-openidc","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libapache2-mod-auth-openidc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.9.4-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-39191.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libapache2-mod-auth-openidc","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libapache2-mod-auth-openidc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.9.4-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-39191.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-39191"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
