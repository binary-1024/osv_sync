  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: iwlwifi: mvm: fix 6 GHz scan construction\n\nIf more than 255 colocated APs exist for the set of all\nAPs found during 2.4/5 GHz scanning, then the 6 GHz scan\nconstruction will loop forever since the loop variable\nhas type u8, which can never reach the number found when\nthat's bigger than 255, and is stored in a u32 variable.\nAlso move it into the loops to have a smaller scope.\n\nUsing a u32 there is fine, we limit the number of APs in\nthe scan list and each has a limit on the number of RNR\nentries due to the frame size. With a limit of 1000 scan\nresults, a frame size upper bound of 4096 (really it's\nmore like ~2300) and a TBTT entry size of at least 11,\nwe get an upper bound for the number of ~372k, well in\nthe bounds of a u32.",
