These objects are like FS streams, but with stat on them, and support directories and symbolic links, as well as normal files.

Extracting tarballs containing a hardlink to a file that already exists in the system, and a file that matches the hardlink, will overwrite the system&apos;s file with the contents of the extracted file.
