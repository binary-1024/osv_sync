An attacker may upload a crafted CI job artifact zip file in a project that uses dynamic child pipelines and make a sidekiq job allocate a lot of memory. In GitLab instances where Sidekiq is memory-limited, this may cause Denial of Service.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gitlab","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/gitlab@8.5.8+dfsg-5?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["8.4.3+dfsg-9","8.4.3+dfsg-12","8.5.8+dfsg-5"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"gitlab","binary_version":"8.5.8+dfsg-5"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2022/UBUNTU-CVE-2022-3759.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-3759"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/379633"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cves/-/blob/master/2022/CVE-2022-3759.json"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/1736230"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-3759"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
