{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-22698","published":"2026-01-10T06:15:52.220Z","modified":"2026-01-11T03:55:04.214924Z","aliases":["GHSA-w3g8-fp6j-wvqw"],"details":"RustCrypto: Elliptic Curves is general purpose Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) support, including types and traits for representing various elliptic curve forms, scalars, points, and public/secret keys composed thereof. In versions 0.14.0-pre.0 and 0.14.0-rc.0, a  critical vulnerability exists in the SM2 Public Key Encryption (PKE) implementation where the ephemeral nonce k is generated with severely reduced entropy. A unit mismatch error causes the nonce generation function to request only 32 bits of randomness instead of the expected 256 bits. This reduces the security of the encryption from a 128-bit level to a trivial 16-bit level, allowing a practical attack to recover the nonce k and decrypt any ciphertext given only the public key and ciphertext. This issue has been patched via commit e4f7778.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rustcrypto/elliptic-curves","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4781762f23ff22ab34763410f648128055c93731"},{"fixed":"e4f77788130d065d760e57fb109370827110a525"}]}],"versions":["bign256/v0.13.0","bign256/v0.13.1","bp256/v0.0.1","bp256/v0.0.2","bp256/v0.1.0","bp256/v0.2.0","bp256/v0.3.0","bp256/v0.4.0","bp256/v0.5.0","bp256/v0.6.0","bp256/v0.6.1","bp384/v0.0.1","bp384/v0.0.2","bp384/v0.1.0","bp384/v0.2.0","bp384/v0.3.0","bp384/v0.4.0","bp384/v0.5.0","bp384/v0.6.0","bp384/v0.6.1","elliptic-curve/v0.3.0","elliptic-curve/v0.4.0","k256/0.12.0-pre.0","k256/v0.1.0","k256/v0.1.1","k256/v0.10.0","k256/v0.10.0-pre.1","k256/v0.10.1","k256/v0.10.2","k256/v0.11.0","k256/v0.11.0-pre.0","k256/v0.11.1","k256/v0.11.2","k256/v0.11.3","k256/v0.11.4","k256/v0.11.5","k256/v0.11.6","k256/v0.12.0","k256/v0.13.0","k256/v0.13.1","k256/v0.13.2","k256/v0.13.3","k256/v0.14.0-pre.0","k256/v0.2.0","k256/v0.3.0","k256/v0.4.0","k256/v0.4.1","k256/v0.4.2","k256/v0.5.0","k256/v0.5.10","k256/v0.5.2","k256/v0.5.3","k256/v0.5.4","k256/v0.5.5","k256/v0.5.6","k256/v0.5.7","k256/v0.5.8","k256/v0.5.9","k256/v0.6.0","k256/v0.7.0","k256/v0.7.1","k256/v0.7.2","k256/v0.8.0","k256/v0.8.0-pre","k256/v0.8.0-pre.1","k256/v0.8.1","k256/v0.9.0","k256/v0.9.1","k256/v0.9.2","k256/v0.9.3","k256/v0.9.4","k256/v0.9.5","k256/v0.9.6","p192/v0.13.0","p224/v0.13.1","p224/v0.13.2","p256/v0.1.0","p256/v0.10.0","p256/v0.10.0-pre.1","p256/v0.10.1","p256/v0.11.0","p256/v0.11.0-pre.0","p256/v0.11.1","p256/v0.12.0","p256/v0.12.0-pre.0","p256/v0.12.0-pre.1","p256/v0.13.0","p256/v0.13.1","p256/v0.13.2","p256/v0.14.0-pre.0","p256/v0.14.0-pre.1","p256/v0.2.0","p256/v0.3.0","p256/v0.4.0","p256/v0.4.1","p256/v0.5.0","p256/v0.5.1","p256/v0.5.2","p256/v0.6.0","p256/v0.7.0","p256/v0.7.1","p256/v0.7.2","p256/v0.8.0","p256/v0.8.0-pre","p256/v0.8.0-pre.1","p256/v0.8.1","p256/v0.9.0","p384/v0.1.0","p384/v0.10.0","p384/v0.11.0","p384/v0.11.1","p384/v0.11.2","p384/v0.12.0","p384/v0.12.0-pre.0","p384/v0.12.0-pre.1","p384/v0.13.0","p384/v0.14.0-pre.1","p384/v0.2.0","p384/v0.3.0","p384/v0.4.0","p384/v0.4.1","p384/v0.5.0","p384/v0.6.0","p384/v0.6.1","p384/v0.7.0","p384/v0.7.0-pre","p384/v0.7.0-pre.1","p384/v0.8.0","p384/v0.9.0","p521/v0.13.0","p521/v0.13.1","p521/v0.13.2","p521/v0.13.3","p521/v0.14.0-pre.1","primefield/v0.14.0-pre.0","primeorder/v0.0.1","primeorder/v0.0.2","primeorder/v0.12.0","primeorder/v0.12.1","primeorder/v0.13.0","primeorder/v0.13.1","primeorder/v0.13.2","primeorder/v0.13.3","primeorder/v0.13.4","primeorder/v0.13.5","primeorder/v0.13.6","primeorder/v0.14.0-pre.1","sm2/v0.13.0","sm2/v0.13.1","sm2/v0.13.2","sm2/v0.13.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22698.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://crates.io/crates/sm2/0.14.0-pre.0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://crates.io/crates/sm2/0.14.0-rc.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves/security/advisories/GHSA-w3g8-fp6j-wvqw"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves/commit/4781762f23ff22ab34763410f648128055c93731"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves/commit/e4f77788130d065d760e57fb109370827110a525"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves/pull/1600"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
