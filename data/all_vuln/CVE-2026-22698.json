{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-22698","published":"2026-01-10T05:17:19.993Z","modified":"2026-01-13T20:10:20.928259Z","aliases":["GHSA-w3g8-fp6j-wvqw"],"summary":"RustCrypto SM2-PKE has 32-bit Biased Nonce Vulnerability","details":"RustCrypto: Elliptic Curves is general purpose Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) support, including types and traits for representing various elliptic curve forms, scalars, points, and public/secret keys composed thereof. In versions 0.14.0-pre.0 and 0.14.0-rc.0, a  critical vulnerability exists in the SM2 Public Key Encryption (PKE) implementation where the ephemeral nonce k is generated with severely reduced entropy. A unit mismatch error causes the nonce generation function to request only 32 bits of randomness instead of the expected 256 bits. This reduces the security of the encryption from a 128-bit level to a trivial 16-bit level, allowing a practical attack to recover the nonce k and decrypt any ciphertext given only the public key and ciphertext. This issue has been patched via commit e4f7778.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rustcrypto/elliptic-curves","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e4f77788130d065d760e57fb109370827110a525"}]}],"versions":["bign256/v0.13.0","bign256/v0.13.1","bignp256/v0.14.0-pre.0","bignp256/v0.14.0-rc.0","bignp256/v0.14.0-rc.1","bignp256/v0.14.0-rc.2","bignp256/v0.14.0-rc.3","bignp256/v0.14.0-rc.4","bp256/v0.0.1","bp256/v0.0.2","bp256/v0.1.0","bp256/v0.14.0-pre.0","bp256/v0.14.0-rc.0","bp256/v0.14.0-rc.1","bp256/v0.14.0-rc.2","bp256/v0.14.0-rc.3","bp256/v0.14.0-rc.4","bp256/v0.2.0","bp256/v0.3.0","bp256/v0.4.0","bp256/v0.5.0","bp256/v0.6.0","bp256/v0.6.1","bp384/v0.0.1","bp384/v0.0.2","bp384/v0.1.0","bp384/v0.14.0-pre.0","bp384/v0.14.0-rc.0","bp384/v0.14.0-rc.1","bp384/v0.14.0-rc.2","bp384/v0.14.0-rc.3","bp384/v0.14.0-rc.4","bp384/v0.2.0","bp384/v0.3.0","bp384/v0.4.0","bp384/v0.5.0","bp384/v0.6.0","bp384/v0.6.1","ed448-goldilocks/v0.14.0-pre.0","ed448-goldilocks/v0.14.0-pre.1","ed448-goldilocks/v0.14.0-pre.2","ed448-goldilocks/v0.14.0-pre.3","ed448-goldilocks/v0.14.0-pre.4","ed448-goldilocks/v0.14.0-pre.5","ed448-goldilocks/v0.14.0-pre.6","ed448-goldilocks/v0.14.0-pre.7","elliptic-curve/v0.3.0","elliptic-curve/v0.4.0","hash2curve/v0.14.0-rc.0","hash2curve/v0.14.0-rc.1","hash2curve/v0.14.0-rc.2","hash2curve/v0.14.0-rc.3","hash2curve/v0.14.0-rc.4","hash2curve/v0.14.0-rc.5","hash2curve/v0.14.0-rc.6","hash2curve/v0.14.0-rc.7","k256/0.12.0-pre.0","k256/v0.1.0","k256/v0.1.1","k256/v0.10.0","k256/v0.10.0-pre.1","k256/v0.10.1","k256/v0.10.2","k256/v0.11.0","k256/v0.11.0-pre.0","k256/v0.11.1","k256/v0.11.2","k256/v0.11.3","k256/v0.11.4","k256/v0.11.5","k256/v0.11.6","k256/v0.12.0","k256/v0.13.0","k256/v0.13.1","k256/v0.13.2","k256/v0.13.3","k256/v0.14.0-pre.0","k256/v0.14.0-pre.1","k256/v0.14.0-pre.10","k256/v0.14.0-pre.11","k256/v0.14.0-pre.2","k256/v0.14.0-pre.3","k256/v0.14.0-pre.4","k256/v0.14.0-pre.5","k256/v0.14.0-pre.6","k256/v0.14.0-pre.7","k256/v0.14.0-pre.8","k256/v0.14.0-pre.9","k256/v0.14.0-rc.0","k256/v0.14.0-rc.1","k256/v0.14.0-rc.2","k256/v0.14.0-rc.3","k256/v0.14.0-rc.4","k256/v0.2.0","k256/v0.3.0","k256/v0.4.0","k256/v0.4.1","k256/v0.4.2","k256/v0.5.0","k256/v0.5.10","k256/v0.5.2","k256/v0.5.3","k256/v0.5.4","k256/v0.5.5","k256/v0.5.6","k256/v0.5.7","k256/v0.5.8","k256/v0.5.9","k256/v0.6.0","k256/v0.7.0","k256/v0.7.1","k256/v0.7.2","k256/v0.8.0","k256/v0.8.0-pre","k256/v0.8.0-pre.1","k256/v0.8.1","k256/v0.9.0","k256/v0.9.1","k256/v0.9.2","k256/v0.9.3","k256/v0.9.4","k256/v0.9.5","k256/v0.9.6","p192/v0.13.0","p192/v0.14.0-rc.0","p192/v0.14.0-rc.1","p192/v0.14.0-rc.2","p192/v0.14.0-rc.3","p192/v0.14.0-rc.4","p224/v0.13.1","p224/v0.13.2","p224/v0.14.0-rc.0","p224/v0.14.0-rc.1","p224/v0.14.0-rc.2","p224/v0.14.0-rc.3","p224/v0.14.0-rc.4","p256/v0.1.0","p256/v0.10.0","p256/v0.10.0-pre.1","p256/v0.10.1","p256/v0.11.0","p256/v0.11.0-pre.0","p256/v0.11.1","p256/v0.12.0","p256/v0.12.0-pre.0","p256/v0.12.0-pre.1","p256/v0.13.0","p256/v0.13.1","p256/v0.13.2","p256/v0.14.0-pre.0","p256/v0.14.0-pre.1","p256/v0.14.0-pre.10","p256/v0.14.0-pre.11","p256/v0.14.0-pre.2","p256/v0.14.0-pre.3","p256/v0.14.0-pre.4","p256/v0.14.0-pre.5","p256/v0.14.0-pre.6","p256/v0.14.0-pre.7","p256/v0.14.0-pre.8","p256/v0.14.0-pre.9","p256/v0.14.0-rc.0","p256/v0.14.0-rc.1","p256/v0.14.0-rc.2","p256/v0.14.0-rc.3","p256/v0.14.0-rc.4","p256/v0.2.0","p256/v0.3.0","p256/v0.4.0","p256/v0.4.1","p256/v0.5.0","p256/v0.5.1","p256/v0.5.2","p256/v0.6.0","p256/v0.7.0","p256/v0.7.1","p256/v0.7.2","p256/v0.8.0","p256/v0.8.0-pre","p256/v0.8.0-pre.1","p256/v0.8.1","p256/v0.9.0","p384/v0.1.0","p384/v0.10.0","p384/v0.11.0","p384/v0.11.1","p384/v0.11.2","p384/v0.12.0","p384/v0.12.0-pre.0","p384/v0.12.0-pre.1","p384/v0.13.0","p384/v0.14.0-pre.1","p384/v0.14.0-pre.10","p384/v0.14.0-pre.11","p384/v0.14.0-pre.2","p384/v0.14.0-pre.3","p384/v0.14.0-pre.4","p384/v0.14.0-pre.5","p384/v0.14.0-pre.6","p384/v0.14.0-pre.7","p384/v0.14.0-pre.8","p384/v0.14.0-pre.9","p384/v0.14.0-rc.0","p384/v0.14.0-rc.1","p384/v0.14.0-rc.2","p384/v0.14.0-rc.3","p384/v0.14.0-rc.4","p384/v0.2.0","p384/v0.3.0","p384/v0.4.0","p384/v0.4.1","p384/v0.5.0","p384/v0.6.0","p384/v0.6.1","p384/v0.7.0","p384/v0.7.0-pre","p384/v0.7.0-pre.1","p384/v0.8.0","p384/v0.9.0","p521/v0.13.0","p521/v0.13.1","p521/v0.13.2","p521/v0.13.3","p521/v0.14.0-pre.1","p521/v0.14.0-pre.10","p521/v0.14.0-pre.11","p521/v0.14.0-pre.2","p521/v0.14.0-pre.3","p521/v0.14.0-pre.4","p521/v0.14.0-pre.5","p521/v0.14.0-pre.6","p521/v0.14.0-pre.7","p521/v0.14.0-pre.8","p521/v0.14.0-pre.9","p521/v0.14.0-rc.0","p521/v0.14.0-rc.1","p521/v0.14.0-rc.2","p521/v0.14.0-rc.3","p521/v0.14.0-rc.4","primefield/v0.14.0-pre.0","primefield/v0.14.0-pre.1","primefield/v0.14.0-pre.2","primefield/v0.14.0-pre.3","primefield/v0.14.0-pre.4","primefield/v0.14.0-pre.5","primefield/v0.14.0-pre.6","primefield/v0.14.0-rc.0","primefield/v0.14.0-rc.1","primefield/v0.14.0-rc.2","primefield/v0.14.0-rc.3","primefield/v0.14.0-rc.4","primeorder/v0.0.1","primeorder/v0.0.2","primeorder/v0.1
