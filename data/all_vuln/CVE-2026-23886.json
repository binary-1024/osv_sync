Prior to Swift W3C TraceContext version 1.0.0-beta.5 and Swift OTel version 1.0.4, a denial-of-service vulnerability due to improper input validation allows a remote attacker to crash the service via a malformed HTTP header. This allows crashing the process with data coming from the network when used with, for example, an HTTP server. Most common way of using Swift W3C Trace Context is through Swift OTel. Version 1.0.0-beta.5 of Swift W3C TraceContext and version 1.0.4 of Swift OTel contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, disable either Swift OTel or the code that extracts the trace information from an incoming header (such as a `TracingMiddleware`).","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/swift-otel/swift-otel","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b5f4d8b3ec75c63bf85526b6ff3789b6de0d54a1"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.1.1","0.10.0","0.10.1","0.11.0","0.12.0","0.2.0","0.3.0","0.4.0","0.5.0","0.6.0","0.7.0","0.8.0","0.9.0","1.0.0","1.0.0-alpha.1","1.0.0-alpha.2","1.0.0-beta.1","1.0.0-rc.1","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23886.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/swift-otel/swift-w3c-trace-context","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5da9b143ba6046734de3fa51dafea28290174e4e"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.2.0","0.3.0","0.4.0","0.5.0","0.6.0","1.0.0-beta.1","1.0.0-beta.2","1.0.0-beta.3","1.0.0-beta.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23886.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23886.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/swift-otel/swift-otel/releases/tag/1.0.4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/swift-otel/swift-w3c-trace-context/commit/5da9b143ba6046734de3fa51dafea28290174e4e"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/swift-otel/swift-w3c-trace-context/releases/tag/1.0.0-beta.5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/swift-otel/swift-w3c-trace-context/security/advisories/GHSA-mvpq-2v8x-ww6g"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23886"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-20"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23886.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
