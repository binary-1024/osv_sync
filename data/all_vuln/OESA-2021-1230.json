It is used for allowing unprivileged processes to speak to privileged processes.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in polkit. When a requesting process disconnects from dbus-daemon just before the call to polkit_system_bus_name_get_creds_sync starts, the process cannot get a unique uid and pid of the process and it cannot verify the privileges of the requesting process.
