  "details": "polkit is a toolkit for defining and handling authorizations. It is used for allowing unprivileged processes to speak to privileged processes.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in polkit. When a requesting process disconnects from dbus-daemon just before the call to polkit_system_bus_name_get_creds_sync starts, the process cannot get a unique uid and pid of the process and it cannot verify the privileges of the requesting process. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.(CVE-2021-3560)",
