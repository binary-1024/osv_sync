The vulnerability stems from the use of the eval() function to process unsanitized, user-supplied parameter values via special converters for angle representations in radians. This flaw allowed attackers to craft and execute arbitrary Python code.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ros-ros-comm","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ros-ros-comm?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.15.13+ds1-1","1.15.13+ds1-2","1.15.13+ds1-3","1.15.13+ds1-4","1.15.13+ds1-5","1.15.13+ds1-6","1.15.14+ds-1","1.15.14+ds-2","1.15.14+ds-3","1.15.14+ds-4","1.15.14+ds-5","1.15.15+ds-1","1.15.15+ds-2","1.15.9+ds1-10","1.15.9+ds1-11","1.15.9+ds1-7","1.15.9+ds1-7+deb11u1","1.15.9+ds1-8","1.15.9+ds1-9","1.16.0+ds-1","1.16.0+ds-2","1.16.0+ds-3","1.16.0+ds-3.1","1.16.0+ds-3.1~exp1","1.16.0+ds-4","1.16.0+ds-5","1.16.0+ds-6","1.17.0+ds-1","1.17.0+ds-2","1.17.4+ds-1","1.17.4+ds-2","1.17.4+ds-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-39289.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ros-ros-comm","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ros-ros-comm?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.15.15+ds-2","1.16.0+ds-1","1.16.0+ds-2","1.16.0+ds-3","1.16.0+ds-3.1","1.16.0+ds-3.1~exp1","1.16.0+ds-4","1.16.0+ds-5","1.16.0+ds-6","1.17.0+ds-1","1.17.0+ds-2","1.17.4+ds-1","1.17.4+ds-2","1.17.4+ds-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-39289.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ros-ros-comm","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ros-ros-comm?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.17.0+ds-2","1.17.4+ds-1","1.17.4+ds-2","1.17.4+ds-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-39289.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ros-ros-comm","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ros-ros-comm?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.17.0+ds-2","1.17.4+ds-1","1.17.4+ds-2","1.17.4+ds-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-39289.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-39289"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
