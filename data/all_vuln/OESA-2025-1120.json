In affected versions `ssl::select_next_proto` can return a slice pointing into the `server` argument&apos;s buffer but with a lifetime bound to the `client` argument. In situations where the `sever` buffer&apos;s lifetime is shorter than the `client` buffer&apos;s, this can cause a use after free. This could cause the server to crash or to return arbitrary memory contents to the client. The crate`openssl` version 0.10.70 fixes the signature of `ssl::select_next_proto` to properly constrain the output buffer&apos;s lifetime to that of both input buffers. Users are advised to upgrade. In standard usage of `ssl::select_next_proto` in the callback passed to `SslContextBuilder::set_alpn_select_callback`, code is only affected if the `server` buffer is constructed *within* the callback.(CVE-2025-24898)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"three-eight-nine-ds-base","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/three-eight-nine-ds-base&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"389-ds-base-3.1.1-5.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["389-ds-base-3.1.1-5.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","389-ds-base-debuginfo-3.1.1-5.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","389-ds-base-debugsource-3.1.1-5.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","389-ds-base-devel-3.1.1-5.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","389-ds-base-help-3.1.1-5.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","389-ds-base-snmp-3.1.1-5.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["cockpit-389-ds-3.1.1-5.oe2403.noarch.rpm","python3-lib389-3.1.1-5.oe2403.noarch.rpm"],"src":["389-ds-base-3.1.1-5.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["389-ds-base-3.1.1-5.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","389-ds-base-debuginfo-3.1.1-5.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","389-ds-base-debugsource-3.1.1-5.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","389-ds-base-devel-3.1.1-5.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","389-ds-base-help-3.1.1-5.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","389-ds-base-snmp-3.1.1-5.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1120.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-1120"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24898"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
