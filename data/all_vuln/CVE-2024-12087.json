It stems from behavior enabled by the `--inc-recursive` option, a default-enabled option for many client options and can be enabled by the server even if not explicitly enabled by the client. When using the `--inc-recursive` option, a lack of proper symlink verification coupled with deduplication checks occurring on a per-file-list basis could allow a server to write files outside of the client's intended destination directory. A malicious server could write malicious files to arbitrary locations named after valid directories/paths on the client.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2600"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:7050"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:8385"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-12087"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2330672"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/952657"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-p5pg-x43v-mvqj"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
