{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-45022","published":"2024-09-11T16:15:07Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:19:31.770217Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-45022"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/vmalloc: fix page mapping if vm_area_alloc_pages() with high order fallback to order 0  The __vmap_pages_range_noflush() assumes its argument pages** contains pages with the same page shift.  However, since commit e9c3cda4d86e (\"mm, vmalloc: fix high order __GFP_NOFAIL allocations\"), if gfp_flags includes __GFP_NOFAIL with high order in vm_area_alloc_pages() and page allocation failed for high order, the pages** may contain two different page shifts (high order and order-0).  This could lead __vmap_pages_range_noflush() to perform incorrect mappings, potentially resulting in memory corruption.  Users might encounter this as follows (vmap_allow_huge = true, 2M is for PMD_SIZE):  kvmalloc(2M, __GFP_NOFAIL|GFP_X)     __vmalloc_node_range_noprof(vm_flags=VM_ALLOW_HUGE_VMAP)         vm_area_alloc_pages(order=9) ---> order-9 allocation failed and fallback to order-0             vmap_pages_range()                 vmap_pages_range_noflush()                     __vmap_pages_range_noflush(page_shift = 21) ----> wrong mapping happens  We can remove the fallback code because if a high-order allocation fails, __vmalloc_node_range_noprof() will retry with order-0.  Therefore, it is unnecessary to fallback to order-0 here.  Therefore, fix this by removing the fallback code.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.112-1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.106-1","6.1.106-2","6.1.106-3","6.1.27-1","6.1.37-1","6.1.38-1","6.1.38-2","6.1.38-2~bpo11+1","6.1.38-3","6.1.38-4","6.1.38-4~bpo11+1","6.1.52-1","6.1.55-1","6.1.55-1~bpo11+1","6.1.64-1","6.1.66-1","6.1.67-1","6.1.69-1","6.1.69-1~bpo11+1","6.1.76-1","6.1.76-1~bpo11+1","6.1.82-1","6.1.85-1","6.1.90-1","6.1.90-1~bpo11+1","6.1.94-1","6.1.94-1~bpo11+1","6.1.98-1","6.1.99-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-45022.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.10.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-45022.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.10.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-45022.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux-6.1","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-6.1?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.119-1~deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.106-3~deb11u1","6.1.106-3~deb11u2","6.1.106-3~deb11u3","6.1.112-1~deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-45022.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-45022"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
