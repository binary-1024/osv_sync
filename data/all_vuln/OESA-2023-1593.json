  "details": "The GNU Binutils are a collection of binary tools. The main ones are: ld - the GNU linker. as - the GNU assembler. addr2line - Converts addresses into filenames and line numbers. ar - A utility for creating, modifying and extracting from archives. c++filt - Filter to demangle encoded C++ symbols. dlltool - Creates files for building and using DLLs. gold - A new, faster, ELF only linker, still in beta test. gprof - Displays profiling information. nlmconv - Converts object code into an NLM. nm - Lists symbols from object files. objcopy - Copies and translates object files. objdump - Displays information from object files. ranlib - Generates an index to the contents of an archive. readelf - Displays information from any ELF format object file. size - Lists the section sizes of an object or archive file. strings - Lists printable strings from files. trip - Discards symbols. windmc - A Windows compatible message compiler. windres - A compiler for Windows resource files.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn illegal memory access flaw was found in the binutils package. Parsing an ELF file containing corrupt symbol version information may result in a denial of service. This issue is the result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-16599.(CVE-2022-4285)\r\n\r\nGNU Binutils before 2.40 was discovered to contain an excessive memory consumption vulnerability via the function bfd_dwarf2_find_nearest_line_with_alt at dwarf2.c. The attacker could supply a crafted ELF file and cause a DNS attack.(CVE-2022-48064)\r\n\r\nA potential heap based buffer overflow was found in _bfd_elf_slurp_version_tables() in bfd/elf.c. This may lead to loss of availability.(CVE-2023-1972)",
