  "summary": "Updated kernel packages fix security vulnerabilities",
  "details": "This kernel update is based on upstream 5.15.110 and fixes atleast the\nfollowing security issues:\n\nA slab-out-of-bound read problem was found in brcmf_get_assoc_ies in\ndrivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/cfg80211.c.\nThis issue could occur when assoc_info->req_len data is bigger than the\nsize of the buffer, defined as WL_EXTRA_BUF_MAX, leading to a denial of\nservice (CVE-2023-1380).\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Xen transport layer\nimplementation for the 9P file system protocol in the Linux kernel, leading\nto a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service or expose sensitive information (CVE-2023-1859).\n\nAn insufficient permission check has been found in the Bluetooth subsystem\nof the Linux kernel when handling ioctl system calls of HCI sockets.\nThis causes tasks without the proper CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can easily\nmark HCI sockets as _trusted_. Trusted sockets are intended to enable the\nsending and receiving of management commands and events, such as pairing\nor connecting with a new device.  As a result, unprivileged users can\nacquire a trusted socket, leading to unauthorized execution of management\ncommands (CVE-2023-2002).\n\nA heap out-of-bounds read/write vulnerability in the Linux Kernel traffic\ncontrol (QoS) subsystem can be exploited to achieve local privilege\nescalation. The qfq_change_class function does not properly limit the lmax\nvariable which can lead to out-of-bounds read/write. If the TCA_QFQ_LMAX\nvalue is not offered through nlattr, lmax is determined by the MTU value\nof the network device. The MTU of the loopback device can be set up to\n2^31-1 and as a result, it is possible to have an lmax value that exceeds\nQFQ_MIN_LMAX (CVE-2023-2248).\n\nqfq_change_class in net/sched/sch_qfq.c in the Linux kernel before 6.2.13\nallows an out-of-bounds write because lmax can exceed QFQ_MIN_LMAX\n(CVE-2023-31436).\n\nLinux kernel use-after-free in Netfilter nf_tables when processing batch\nrequests can be abused to perform arbitrary reads and writes in kernel\nmemory. An unprivilegied local user can exploit this to start a local \nroot shell (CVE-2023-32233).\n\nFor other upstream fixes in this update, see the referenced changelogs.\n",
