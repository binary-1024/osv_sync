Prior to version b5662, an attacker‐supplied GGUF model vocabulary can trigger a buffer overflow in llama.cpp’s vocabulary‐loading code. Specifically, the helper _try_copy in llama.cpp/src/vocab.cpp: llama_vocab::impl::token_to_piece() casts a very large size_t token length into an int32_t, causing the length check (if (length < (int32_t)size)) to be bypassed. As a result, memcpy is still called with that oversized size, letting a malicious model overwrite memory beyond the intended buffer. This can lead to arbitrary memory corruption and potential code execution. This issue has been patched in version b5662.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"llama.cpp","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/llama.cpp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5713+dfsg-1"}]}],"versions":["5151+dfsg-1~exp2","5151+dfsg-1~exp3","5318+dfsg-1","5318+dfsg-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-49847.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-49847"}]}
