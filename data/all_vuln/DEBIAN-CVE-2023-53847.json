{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53847","published":"2025-12-09T16:17:25.137Z","modified":"2025-12-10T11:16:48.905652Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-53847"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb-storage: alauda: Fix uninit-value in alauda_check_media()  Syzbot got KMSAN to complain about access to an uninitialized value in the alauda subdriver of usb-storage:  BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in alauda_transport+0x462/0x57f0 drivers/usb/storage/alauda.c:1137 CPU: 0 PID: 12279 Comm: usb-storage Not tainted 5.3.0-rc7+ #0 Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 01/01/2011 Call Trace:   __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:77 [inline]   dump_stack+0x191/0x1f0 lib/dump_stack.c:113   kmsan_report+0x13a/0x2b0 mm/kmsan/kmsan_report.c:108   __msan_warning+0x73/0xe0 mm/kmsan/kmsan_instr.c:250   alauda_check_media+0x344/0x3310 drivers/usb/storage/alauda.c:460  The problem is that alauda_check_media() doesn't verify that its USB transfer succeeded before trying to use the received data.  What should happen if the transfer fails isn't entirely clear, but a reasonably conservative approach is to pretend that no media is present.  A similar problem exists in a usb_stor_dbg() call in alauda_get_media_status().  In this case, when an error occurs the call is redundant, because usb_stor_ctrl_transfer() already will print a debugging message.  Finally, unrelated to the uninitialized memory access, is the fact that alauda_check_media() performs DMA to a buffer on the stack. Fortunately usb-storage provides a general purpose DMA-able buffer for uses like this.  We'll use it instead.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.191-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.103-1","5.10.103-1~bpo10+1","5.10.106-1","5.10.113-1","5.10.120-1","5.10.120-1~bpo10+1","5.10.127-1","5.10.127-2","5.10.127-2~bpo10+1","5.10.136-1","5.10.140-1","5.10.148-1","5.10.149-1","5.10.149-2","5.10.158-1","5.10.158-2","5.10.162-1","5.10.178-1","5.10.178-2","5.10.178-3","5.10.179-1","5.10.179-2","5.10.179-3","5.10.179-4","5.10.179-5","5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1","5.10.92-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53847.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.52-1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.27-1","6.1.37-1","6.1.38-1","6.1.38-2","6.1.38-2~bpo11+1","6.1.38-3","6.1.38-4","6.1.38-4~bpo11+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53847.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.4.11-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53847.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.4.11-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53847.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-53847"}]}
