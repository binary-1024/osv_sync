It handles all requests in a single, non-blocking, I/O-driven process and keeps meta data and implements negative caching of failed requests.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Squid through 4.13 and 5.x through 5.0.4. Due to improper input validation, it allows a trusted client to perform HTTP Request Smuggling and access services otherwise forbidden by the security controls. This occurs for certain uri_whitespace configuration settings.(CVE-2020-25097)",
