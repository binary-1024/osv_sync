In versions from 38.0.0 to before 38.0.3, the implementation of component-model related host-to-wasm trampolines in Wasmtime contained a bug where it's possible to carefully craft a component, which when called in a specific way, would crash the host with a segfault or assert failure. Wasmtime 38.0.3 has been released and is patched to fix this issue. There are no workarounds.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"rust-wasmtime","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/rust-wasmtime@16.0.0+dfsg-3?arch=source&distro=noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["10.0.1+dfsg-7","15.0.1+dfsg-4","16.0.0+dfsg-2","16.0.0+dfsg-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"librust-cranelift-dev","binary_version":"0.103.0+16.0.0+dfsg-3"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-62711.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rust-wasmtime","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.10","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/rust-wasmtime@26.0.1+dfsg-3?arch=source&distro=questing"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["26.0.1+dfsg-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"librust-cranelift-dev","binary_version":"0.113.1+26.0.1+dfsg-3"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-62711.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rust-wasmtime","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.04","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/rust-wasmtime@26.0.1+dfsg-3?arch=source&distro=plucky"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["19.0.0+dfsg-3","19.0.0+dfsg-4","21.0.2+dfsg-1","21.0.2+dfsg-1.1","21.0.2+dfsg-3","23.0.3+dfsg-1","26.0.1+dfsg-1","26.0.1+dfsg-2","26.0.1+dfsg-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"librust-cranelift-dev","binary_version":"0.113.1+26.0.1+dfsg-3"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-62711.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-62711"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62711"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-4h67-722j-5pmc"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/192f2fcdadfec9d0cf6b58548a85a7307450cbf5"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11592"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:L"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
