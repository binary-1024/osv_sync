  "details": "This library allows to manipulate XML files. It includes support to read, modify and write XML and HTML files. There is DTDs support this includes parsing and validation even with complex DtDs, either at parse time or later once the document has been modified. The output can be a simple SAX stream or and in-memory DOM like representations. In this case one can use the built-in XPath and XPointer implementation to select sub nodes or ranges. A flexible Input/Output mechanism is available, with existing HTTP and FTP modules and combined to an URI library.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in libxml2. Parsing a XML document with the XML_PARSE_HUGE option enabled can result in an integer overflow because safety checks were missing in some functions. Also, the xmlParseEntityValue function didn&apos;t have any length limitation.(CVE-2022-40303)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in libxml2. When a reference cycle is detected in the XML entity cleanup function the XML entity data can be stored in a dictionary. In this case, the dictionary becomes corrupted resulting in logic errors, including memory errors like double free.(CVE-2022-40304)",
