Its functionality can be enhanced via a plethora of extensions.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nWhen receiving rendering data over IPC `mStream` could have been destroyed when initialized, which could have led to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 117, Firefox ESR &lt; 102.15, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.2, Thunderbird &lt; 102.15, and Thunderbird &lt; 115.2.(CVE-2023-4573)\r\n\r\nWhen creating a callback over IPC for showing the Color Picker window, multiple of the same callbacks could have been created at a time and eventually all simultaneously destroyed as soon as one of the callbacks finished. This could have led to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 117, Firefox ESR &lt; 102.15, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.2, Thunderbird &lt; 102.15, and Thunderbird &lt; 115.2.(CVE-2023-4574)\r\n\r\nWhen creating a callback over IPC for showing the File Picker window, multiple of the same callbacks could have been created at a time and eventually all simultaneously destroyed as soon as one of the callbacks finished. This could have led to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 117, Firefox ESR &lt; 102.15, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.2, Thunderbird &lt; 102.15, and Thunderbird &lt; 115.2.(CVE-2023-4575)\r\n\r\nExcel `.xll` add-in files did not have a blocklist entry in Firefox&apos;s executable blocklist which allowed them to be downloaded without any warning of their potential harm. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 117, Firefox ESR &lt; 102.15, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.2, Thunderbird &lt; 102.15, and Thunderbird &lt; 115.2.(CVE-2023-4581)\r\n\r\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 116, Firefox ESR 102.14, Firefox ESR 115.1, Thunderbird 102.14, and Thunderbird 115.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 117, Firefox ESR &lt; 102.15, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.2, Thunderbird &lt; 102.15, and Thunderbird &lt; 115.2.(CVE-2023-4584)\r\n\r\nHeap buffer overflow in libwebp in Google Chrome prior to 116.0.5845.187 and libwebp 1.3.2 allowed a remote attacker to perform an out of bounds memory write via a crafted HTML page.
