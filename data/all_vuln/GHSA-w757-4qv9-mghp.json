When a JSON-RPC request uses the string form of certain APIs, attacker-controlled parameter text is parsed into values using String#convert_to_value. For array-like inputs, convert_to_value executes eval().\n\nBecause the cmd code path parses the command string before calling authorize(), an unauthenticated attacker can trigger Ruby code execution even though the request ultimately fails authorization (401).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"openc3","ecosystem":"RubyGems","purl":"pkg:gem/openc3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.0.6"},{"fixed":"6.10.2"}]}],"versions":["5.0.10","5.0.11","5.0.6","5.0.7","5.0.8","5.0.9","5.1.0","5.1.1","5.10.0","5.10.1","5.11.0","5.11.1","5.11.2","5.11.3","5.12.0","5.13.0","5.14.0","5.14.1","5.14.2","5.15.0","5.15.1","5.15.2","5.16.0","5.16.1","5.16.2","5.17.0","5.17.1","5.18.0","5.19.0","5.2.0","5.20.0","5.3.0","5.4.0","5.4.1","5.4.2","5.4.3.pre.beta0","5.5.0","5.5.0.pre.beta0","5.5.1","5.5.2","5.5.2.pre.beta0","5.6.0","5.6.1","5.7.0","5.7.2","5.8.0","5.8.1","5.9.0","5.9.1","6.0.0","6.0.1","6.0.2","6.1.0","6.10.0","6.10.1","6.2.0","6.2.1","6.3.0","6.4.0","6.4.1","6.4.2","6.5.0","6.5.1","6.6.0","6.7.0","6.8.0","6.8.1","6.9.0","6.9.1","6.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-w757-4qv9-mghp/GHSA-w757-4qv9-mghp.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/OpenC3/cosmos/security/advisories/GHSA-w757-4qv9-mghp"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68271"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/OpenC3/cosmos/commit/01e9fbc5e66e9a2500b71a75a44775dd1fc2d1de"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/OpenC3/cosmos"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-95"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-13T19:01:49Z","nvd_published_at":"2026-01-13T19:16:14Z","severity":"CRITICAL"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
