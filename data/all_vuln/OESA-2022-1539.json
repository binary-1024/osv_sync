Security Fix(es): In memory management driver, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.(CVE-2022-0492) An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file descriptor.(CVE-2022-24448) A stack overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s TIPC protocol functionality in the way a user sends a packet with malicious content where the number of domain member nodes is higher than the 64 allowed. This flaw allows a remote user to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges if they have access to the TIPC network.(CVE-2022-0435) An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c.(CVE-2022-24959) drivers/usb/gadget/legacy/inode.c in the Linux kernel through 5.16.8 mishandles dev->buf
