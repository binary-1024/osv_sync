{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-45681","published":"2023-10-20T23:26:56Z","modified":"2025-10-21T02:36:49Z","related":["MGASA-2024-0186","openSUSE-SU-2025:0037-1","openSUSE-SU-2025:14642-1"],"summary":"Out of bounds heap buffer write in stb_vorbis","details":"stb_vorbis is a single file MIT licensed library for processing ogg vorbis files. A crafted file may trigger memory write past an allocated heap buffer in `start_decoder`. The root cause is a potential integer overflow in `sizeof(char*) * (f->comment_list_length)` which may make `setup_malloc` allocate less memory than required. Since there is another integer overflow an attacker may overflow it too to force `setup_malloc` to return 0 and make the exploit more reliable. This issue may lead to code execution.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-45681.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1.22"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-145_GHSL-2023-151_stb_image_h/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/5736b15f7ea0ffb08dd38af21067c314d6a3aae9/stb_vorbis.c#L3660-L3677"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2MHQQXX27ACLLYUQHWSL3DVCOGUK5ZA4/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2WRORYQ2Z2XXHPX36JHBUSDVY6IOMW2N/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LBIPXOBWUHPAH4QHMVP2AWWAPDDZDQ66/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
