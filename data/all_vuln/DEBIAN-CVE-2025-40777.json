  "details": "If a `named` caching resolver is configured with `serve-stale-enable` `yes`, and with `stale-answer-client-timeout` set to `0` (the only allowable value other than `disabled`), and if the resolver, in the process of resolving a query, encounters a CNAME chain involving a specific combination of cached or authoritative records, the daemon will abort with an assertion failure.
