{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-23625","published":"2026-01-19T17:41:41.803Z","modified":"2026-01-20T19:48:56.802368Z","aliases":["GHSA-cvpq-cc56-gwxx"],"summary":"OpenProject has stored XSS regression using attachments and script-src self","details":"OpenProject is an open-source, web-based project management software. Versions 16.3.0 through 16.6.4 are affected by a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Roadmap view. OpenProject’s roadmap view renders the “Related work packages” list for each version. When a version contains work packages from a different project (e.g., a subproject), the helper link_to_work_package prepends package.project.to_s to the link and returns the entire string with .html_safe. Because project names are user-controlled and no escaping happens before calling html_safe, any HTML placed in a subproject name is injected verbatim into the page. The underlying issue is mitigated in versions 16.6.5 and 17.0.0 by setting a `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header, which was in place until a refactoring move to Rails standard content-security policy, which did not properly apply this header in the new configuration since OpenProject 16.3.0. Those who cannot upgrade their installations should ensure that they add a X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header in their proxying web application server.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opf/openproject","events":[{"introduced":"c8e587a9592e6a4999eec6d16aa83eb11a89fba2"},{"fixed":"99112f321595e2fa5bd54727ceb2a20a07157af3"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"16.3.0"},{"fixed":"16.6.5"}]}}],"versions":["v16.3.0","v16.3.1","v16.3.2","v16.4.0","v16.4.1","v16.5.0","v16.5.1","v16.6.0","v16.6.1","v16.6.2","v16.6.3","v16.6.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23625.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23625.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/opf/openproject/releases/tag/v16.6.5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/opf/openproject/releases/tag/v17.0.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/opf/openproject/security/advisories/GHSA-cvpq-cc56-gwxx"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23625"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23625.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
