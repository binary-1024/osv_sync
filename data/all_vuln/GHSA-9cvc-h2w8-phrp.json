An actor with access to the environment in which the SDK is used could set the region input field to an invalid value.\n\nA defense-in-depth enhancement has been implemented in the AWS SDK for .NET v4. This enhancement validates that a region used to construct an endpoint URL is a valid host label. The change was released on Nov 21, 2025. This advisory is informational to help customers understand their responsibilities regarding configuration security.\n\n### Impact\nCustomer applications could be configured to improperly route AWS API calls to non-existent or non-AWS hosts. While the SDK was functioning safely within the requirements of the shared responsibility model, additional safeguards have been added to support secure customer implementations.\n\nImpacted versions: All versions of the AWS SDK for .NET V4 prior to the 4.0.139.0 release (the AWS SDK for .NET V3 was not impacted)\n\n### Patches\nOn Nov 21, 2025, an enhancement [1] was made to the AWS SDK for .NET v4 release, which validates the formatting of a region, providing additional safeguards. \n\n### Workarounds\nNo workarounds are needed, but as always developers should ensure that their application is following security best practices:\n- Implement proper input validation in your application code\n- Update to the latest AWS SDK for .NET release on a regular basis\n- Follow AWS security best practices [2] for SDK configuration\n\n### References\nContact AWS Security via the vulnerability reporting page or email [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).\n\n### Acknowledgement\nAWS SDK for .NET v4 thanks Guy Arazi for bringing these customer security considerations to our attention through the coordinated disclosure process.\n\n[1] https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/pull/4150\n\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/v4/developer-guide/security.html","affected":[{"package":{"name":"AWSSDK.Core","ecosystem":"NuGet","purl":"pkg:nuget/AWSSDK.Core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"4.0.0"},{"fixed":"4.0.3.3"}]}],"versions":["4.0.0","4.0.0.1","4.0.0.10","4.0.0.11","4.0.0.12","4.0.0.13","4.0.0.14","4.0.0.15","4.0.0.16","4.0.0.17","4.0.0.18","4.0.0.19","4.0.0.2","4.0.0.20","4.0.0.21","4.0.0.22","4.0.0.23","4.0.0.24","4.0.0.25","4.0.0.26","4.0.0.27","4.0.0.28","4.0.0.29","4.0.0.3","4.0.0.30","4.0.0.31","4.0.0.32","4.0.0.33","4.0.0.4","4.0.0.5","4.0.0.6","4.0.0.7","4.0.0.8","4.0.0.9","4.0.1","4.0.1.1","4.0.1.2","4.0.1.3","4.0.2","4.0.3","4.0.3.1","4.0.3.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-9cvc-h2w8-phrp/GHSA-9cvc-h2w8-phrp.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/security/advisories/GHSA-9cvc-h2w8-phrp"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22611"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-09T18:56:21Z","nvd_published_at":"2026-01-10T06:15:51Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
