It includes support to read, modify and write XML and HTML files. There is DTDs support this includes parsing and validation even with complex DtDs, either at parse time or later once the document has been modified. The output can be a simple SAX stream or and in-memory DOM like representations. In this case one can use the built-in XPath and XPointer implementation to select sub nodes or ranges. A flexible Input/Output mechanism is available, with existing HTTP and FTP modules and combined to an URI library.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nPossible cross-site scripting vulnerability in libxml after commit 960f0e2.(CVE-2016-3709)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libxml2","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/libxml2&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.10-31.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libxml2-devel-2.9.10-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libxml2-debuginfo-2.9.10-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libxml2-2.9.10-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-libxml2-2.9.10-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python2-libxml2-2.9.10-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libxml2-debugsource-2.9.10-31.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["libxml2-help-2.9.10-31.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["libxml2-2.9.10-31.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libxml2-devel-2.9.10-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libxml2-debugsource-2.9.10-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libxml2-2.9.10-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-libxml2-2.9.10-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libxml2-debuginfo-2.9.10-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python2-libxml2-2.9.10-31.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1829.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2022-1829"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-3709"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
