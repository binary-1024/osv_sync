  "details": "cURL is a computer software project providing a library (libcurl) and command-line tool (curl) for transferring data using various protocols.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\ncurl supports &quot;chained&quot; HTTP compression algorithms, meaning that a server response can be compressed multiple times and potentially with different algorithms. The number of acceptable &quot;links&quot; in this &quot;decompression chain&quot; was capped, but the cap was implemented on a per-header basis allowing a malicious server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps simply by using many headers. The use of such a decompression chain could result in a &quot;malloc bomb&quot;, making curl end up spending enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying to and returning out of memory errors.(CVE-2023-23916)",
