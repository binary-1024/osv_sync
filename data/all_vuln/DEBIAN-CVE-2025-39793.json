  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/memmap: cast nr_pages to size_t before shifting  If the allocated size exceeds UINT_MAX, then it's necessary to cast the mr->nr_pages value to size_t to prevent it from overflowing. In practice this isn't much of a concern as the required memory size will have been validated upfront, and accounted to the user. And > 4GB sizes will be necessary to make the lack of a cast a problem, which greatly exceeds normal user locked_vm settings that are generally in the kb to mb range. However, if root is used, then accounting isn't done, and then it's possible to hit this issue.",
