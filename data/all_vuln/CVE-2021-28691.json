Such kernel thread termination will lead to a use-after-free in Linux netback when the backend is destroyed, as the kernel thread associated with queue 0 will have already exited and thus the call to kthread_stop will be performed against a stale pointer.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-30"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210805-0002/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-374.txt"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
