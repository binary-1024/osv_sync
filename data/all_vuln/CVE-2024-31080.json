This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1785"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2036"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2037"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2038"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2039"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2040"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2041"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2042"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2080"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2616"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3258"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3261"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3343"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9093"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9122"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:12751"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2271997"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-31080"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/13"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/12/10"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/04/msg00009.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6TF7FZXOKHIKPZXYIMSQXKVH7WITKV3V/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EBLQJIAXEDMEGRGZMSH7CWUJHSVKUWLV/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/P73U4DAAWLFZAPD75GLXTGMSTTQWW5AP/"}]}
