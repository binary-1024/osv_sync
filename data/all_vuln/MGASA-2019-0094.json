  "summary": "Updated tcpreplay packages fix security vulnerability",
  "details": "An issue was discovered in Tcpreplay 4.3.0 beta1. A heap-based buffer\nover-read was triggered in the function dlt_en10mb_encode() of the file\nplugins/dlt_en10mb/en10mb.c, due to inappropriate values in the function\nmemmove(). The length (pktlen + ctx -> l2len) can be larger than source\nvalue (packet + ctx->l2len) because the function fails to ensure the length\nof a packet is valid. This leads to Denial of Service. (CVE-2018-17974)\n\nA heap-based buffer over-read exists in the function fast_edit_packet() in\nthe file send_packets.c of Tcpreplay v4.3.0 beta1. This can lead to Denial\nof Service (DoS) and potentially Information Exposure when the application\nattempts to process a crafted pcap file. (CVE-2018-17580)\n\nTcpreplay v4.3.0 beta1 contains a heap-based buffer over-read. The\nget_next_packet() function in the send_packets.c file uses the memcpy()\nfunction unsafely to copy sequences from the source buffer pktdata to the\ndestination (*prev_packet)->pktdata. This will result in a Denial of\nService (DoS) and potentially Information Exposure when the application\nattempts to process a file. (CVE-2018-17582)\n\nA heap-based buffer over-read was discovered in the tcpreplay-edit binary\nof Tcpreplay 4.3.0 beta1, during the incremental checksum operation. The\nissue gets triggered in the function csum_replace4() in\nincremental_checksum.h, causing a denial of service. (CVE-2018-18407)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in the tcpbridge binary of Tcpreplay 4.3.0\nbeta1. The issue gets triggered in the function post_args() at tcpbridge.c,\ncausing a denial of service or possibly unspecified other impact.\n(CVE-2018-18408)\n",
