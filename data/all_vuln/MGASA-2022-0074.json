  "details": "Buffer overflow vulnerability in function stbi__extend_receive in stb_image.h\nin stb 2.26 via a crafted JPEG file. (CVE-2021-28021)\n\nAn issue was discovered in stb stb_image.h 1.33 through 2.27. The HDR loader\nparsed truncated end-of-file RLE scanlines as an infinite sequence of\nzero-length runs. An attacker could potentially have caused denial of service\nin applications using stb_image by submitting crafted HDR files.\n(CVE-2021-42715)\n\nAn issue was discovered in stb stb_image.h 2.27. The PNM loader incorrectly\ninterpreted 16-bit PGM files as 8-bit when converting to RGBA, leading to a\nbuffer overflow when later reinterpreting the result as a 16-bit buffer. An\nattacker could potentially have crashed a service using stb_image, or read up\nto 1024 bytes of non-consecutive heap data without control over the read\nlocation. (CVE-2021-42716)\n",
