When network operations are aborted at specific timing intervals, an internal message queue item may be freed twice due to missing state synchronization. This leads to a use-after-free memory access, potentially crashing the affected application. Attackers could exploit this behavior remotely by triggering specific HTTP/2 read and cancel sequences, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libsoup3","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libsoup3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.2.2-2","3.2.3-0+deb12u1","3.2.3-0+deb12u2","3.3.1-1","3.4.0-1","3.4.1-1","3.4.2-1","3.4.2-2","3.4.2-3","3.4.2-4","3.4.3-1","3.4.4-1","3.4.4-2","3.4.4-3","3.4.4-4","3.4.4-5","3.5.2-1","3.6.0-1","3.6.0-2","3.6.0-3","3.6.0-4","3.6.1-1","3.6.4-1","3.6.4-2","3.6.4-3","3.6.5-1","3.6.5-2","3.6.5-3","3.6.5-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-12105.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libsoup3","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libsoup3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.6.5-3","3.6.5-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-12105.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libsoup3","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libsoup3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.6.5-3","3.6.5-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-12105.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-12105"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
