{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-21897","published":"2026-01-10T00:07:16.920Z","modified":"2026-01-13T20:01:04.138330Z","aliases":["GHSA-9x7j-gx23-7m5r"],"summary":"CryptoLib Has Out-of-Bounds Write in Crypto_Config_Add_Gvcid_Managed_Parameters","details":"CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. Prior to version 1.4.3, the Crypto_Config_Add_Gvcid_Managed_Parameters function only checks whether gvcid_counter > GVCID_MAN_PARAM_SIZE. As a result, it allows up to the 251st entry, which causes a write past the end of the array, overwriting gvcid_counter located immediately after gvcid_managed_parameters_array[250]. This leads to an out-of-bounds write, and the overwritten gvcid_counter may become an arbitrary value, potentially affecting the parameter lookup/registration logic that relies on it. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nasa/cryptolib","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9ffda0ff78e8f74c58db4c181923196870e04c3e"}]}],"versions":["v0.1-engineering-release","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-21897.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/21xxx/CVE-2026-21897.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/releases/tag/v1.4.3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-9x7j-gx23-7m5r"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-21897"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-787"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/21xxx/CVE-2026-21897.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
