  "details": "Updated apache packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the mod_cache httpd\nmodule handled Content-Type headers. A malicious HTTP server could cause\nthe httpd child process to crash when the Apache HTTP server was configured\nto proxy to a server with caching enabled (CVE-2014-3581).\n\nA flaw was found in the way httpd handled HTTP Trailer headers when\nprocessing requests using chunked encoding. A malicious client could use\nTrailer headers to set additional HTTP headers after header processing was\nperformed by other modules. This could, for example, lead to a bypass of\nheader restrictions defined with mod_headers (CVE-2013-5704).\n\nNote: With this update, httpd has been modified to not merge HTTP Trailer\nheaders with other HTTP request headers. A newly introduced configuration\ndirective MergeTrailers can be used to re-enable the old method of\nprocessing Trailer headers, which also re-introduces the aforementioned\nflaw.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\nPrior to this update, the mod_proxy_wstunnel module failed to set up an\nSSL connection when configured to use a back end server using the \"wss:\"\nURL scheme, causing proxied connections to fail. In these updated packages,\nSSL is used when proxying to \"wss:\" back end servers (rhbz#1141950).\n",
