In certain scenarios, while iterating through disk sectors, it assumes the read size from the disk is always smaller than the allocated buffer size which is not guaranteed. A crafted filesystem image may lead to a heap-based buffer overflow resulting in critical data to be corrupted, resulting in the risk of arbitrary code execution by-passing secure boot protections.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-0689"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2346122"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2025-02/msg00024.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
