{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-46837","published":"2024-01-05T17:15:11Z","modified":"2025-08-09T19:01:28Z","details":"Arm provides multiple helpers to clean & invalidate the cache\nfor a given region.  This is, for instance, used when allocating\nguest memory to ensure any writes (such as the ones during scrubbing)\nhave reached memory before handing over the page to a guest.\n\nUnfortunately, the arithmetics in the helpers can overflow and would\nthen result to skip the cache cleaning/invalidation.  Therefore there\nis no guarantee when all the writes will reach the memory.\n\nThis undefined behavior was meant to be addressed by XSA-437, but the\napproach was not sufficient.","references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-447.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JFVKWYQFRUU3CAS53THTUKXEOUDWI42G/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XLL6SQ6IKFYXLYWITYZCRV5IBRK5G35R/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
