  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: avoid hci_dev_test_and_set_flag() in mgmt_init_hdev()  syzbot is again reporting attempt to cancel uninitialized work at mgmt_index_removed() [1], for setting of HCI_MGMT flag from mgmt_init_hdev() from hci_mgmt_cmd() from hci_sock_sendmsg() can race with testing of HCI_MGMT flag from mgmt_index_removed() from hci_sock_bind() due to lack of serialization via hci_dev_lock().  Since mgmt_init_hdev() is called with mgmt_chan_list_lock held, we can safely split hci_dev_test_and_set_flag() into hci_dev_test_flag() and hci_dev_set_flag(). Thus, in order to close this race, set HCI_MGMT flag after INIT_DELAYED_WORK() completed.  This is a local fix based on mgmt_chan_list_lock. Lack of serialization via hci_dev_lock() might be causing different race conditions somewhere else. But a global fix based on hci_dev_lock() should deserve a future patch.",
