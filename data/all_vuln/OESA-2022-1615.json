BIND includes a DNS server (named), which resolves host names to IP addresses; a resolver library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating properly.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nBIND 9.11.0 -&gt; 9.11.36 9.12.0 -&gt; 9.16.26 9.17.0 -&gt; 9.18.0 BIND Supported Preview Editions: 9.11.4-S1 -&gt; 9.11.36-S1 9.16.8-S1 -&gt; 9.16.26-S1 Versions of BIND 9 earlier than those shown - back to 9.1.0, including Supported Preview Editions - are also believed to be affected but have not been tested as they are EOL. The cache could become poisoned with incorrect records leading to queries being made to the wrong servers, which might also result in false information being returned to clients.(CVE-2021-25220)\n\n\nBIND 9.16.11 -> 9.16.26, 9.17.0 -> 9.18.0 and versions 9.16.11-S1 -> 9.16.26-S1 of the BIND Supported Preview Edition. Specifically crafted TCP streams can cause connections to BIND to remain in CLOSE_WAIT status for an indefinite period of time, even after the client has terminated the connection.(CVE-2022-0396)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"bind","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/bind&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.16.23-8.oe2203"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["bind-debugsource-9.16.23-8.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","bind-utils-9.16.23-8.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","bind-libs-9.16.23-8.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","bind-9.16.23-8.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","bind-libs-lite-9.16.23-8.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","bind-chroot-9.16.23-8.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","bind-export-libs-9.16.23-8.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","bind-devel-9.16.23-8.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-devel-9.16.23-8.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","bind-export-devel-9.16.23-8.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-9.16.23-8.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","bind-debuginfo-9.16.23-8.oe2203.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["python3-bind-9.16.23-8.oe2203.noarch.rpm"],"src":["bind-9.16.23-8.oe2203.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["bind-debuginfo-9.16.23-8.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","bind-export-devel-9.16.23-8.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","bind-chroot-9.16.23-8.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","bind-utils-9.16.23-8.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","bind-debugsource-9.16.23-8.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","bind-libs-9.16.23-8.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","bind-devel-9.16.23-8.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","bind-libs-lite-9.16.23-8.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-devel-9.16.23-8.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","bind-9.16.23-8.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","bind-export-libs-9.16.23-8.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","bind-pkcs11-9.16.23-8.oe2203.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1615.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2022-1615"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-25220"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0396"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
