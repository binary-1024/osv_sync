  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: endpoint: Fix PCI domain ID release in pci_epc_destroy()  pci_epc_destroy() invokes pci_bus_release_domain_nr() to release the PCI domain ID, but there are two issues:    - 'epc->dev' is passed to pci_bus_release_domain_nr() which was already     freed by device_unregister(), leading to a use-after-free issue.    - Domain ID corresponds to the EPC device parent, so passing 'epc->dev'     is also wrong.  Fix these issues by passing 'epc->dev.parent' to pci_bus_release_domain_nr() and also do it before device_unregister().  [mani: reworded subject and description]",
