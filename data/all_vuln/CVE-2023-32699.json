{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-32699","published":"2023-05-30T18:59:26.174Z","modified":"2025-12-19T20:11:25.279633Z","aliases":["GHSA-qffq-8gf8-mhq7"],"summary":"MeterSphere denial of service vulnerability","details":"MeterSphere is an open source continuous testing platform. Version 2.9.1 and prior are vulnerable to denial of service. ​The `checkUserPassword` method is used to check whether the password provided by the user matches the password saved in the database, and the `CodingUtil.md5` method is used to encrypt the original password with MD5 to ensure that the password will not be saved in plain text when it is stored. If a user submits a very long password when logging in, the system will be forced to execute the long password MD5 encryption process, causing the server CPU and memory to be exhausted, thereby causing a denial of service attack on the server. This issue is fixed in version 2.10.0-lts with a maximum password length.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/metersphere/metersphere","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c59e381d368990214813085a1a4877c5ef865411"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-32699.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["302016832645427357716875929316897625204","297338400711049676067100816395585245085","101014025618894918484233941921977024828","79876131419348352444625031846973686176","316962829225154079554294823323324910192","294599319603097371682731934772375270699","23963501746478478472044483558178822905","305549990098339194341144083957566425297"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2023-32699-4934b670","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/metersphere/metersphere/commit/c59e381d368990214813085a1a4877c5ef865411","target":{"file":"framework/gateway/src/main/java/io/metersphere/gateway/service/UserLoginService.java"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"113441866152606268676205312983640051109","length":445},"id":"CVE-2023-32699-9fb65754","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/metersphere/metersphere/commit/c59e381d368990214813085a1a4877c5ef865411","target":{"file":"framework/gateway/src/main/java/io/metersphere/gateway/service/UserLoginService.java","function":"checkUserPassword"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/32xxx/CVE-2023-32699.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/metersphere/metersphere/commit/c59e381d368990214813085a1a4877c5ef865411"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/metersphere/metersphere/security/advisories/GHSA-qffq-8gf8-mhq7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32699"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-770"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/32xxx/CVE-2023-32699.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
