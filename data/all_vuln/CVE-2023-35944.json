{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-35944","published":"2023-07-25T18:35:59.135Z","modified":"2025-12-19T20:12:43.086483Z","aliases":["BIT-envoy-2023-35944","GHSA-pvgm-7jpg-pw5g"],"summary":"Envoy vulnerable to incorrect handling of HTTP requests and responses with mixed case schemes","details":"Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications. Envoy allows mixed-case schemes in HTTP/2, however, some internal scheme checks are case-sensitive. Prior to versions 1.27.0, 1.26.4, 1.25.9, 1.24.10, and 1.23.12, this can lead to the rejection of requests with mixed-case schemes such as `htTp` or `htTps`, or the bypassing of some requests such as `https` in unencrypted connections. With a fix in versions 1.27.0, 1.26.4, 1.25.9, 1.24.10, and 1.23.12, Envoy will now lowercase scheme values by default, and change the internal scheme checks that were case-sensitive to be case-insensitive. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy","events":[{"introduced":"ce49c7f65668a22b80d1e83c35d170741bb8d46a"},{"fixed":"9689bc57f80fe56dbb16a4e0d632cde5363d1811"}]}],"versions":["v1.23.0","v1.23.1","v1.23.10","v1.23.11","v1.23.2","v1.23.3","v1.23.4","v1.23.5","v1.23.6","v1.23.7","v1.23.8","v1.23.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-35944.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/35xxx/CVE-2023-35944.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-pvgm-7jpg-pw5g"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35944"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-20"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/35xxx/CVE-2023-35944.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N"}]}
