However, this is currently broken on Mediatek MT8188 (Genio 700 EVK platform); tested using upstream Kernel and Mesa (v25.2.1), AFBC is used by default since Mesa v25.0.  Kernel trace reports vblank timeouts constantly, and the render is garbled:  ``` [CRTC:62:crtc-0] vblank wait timed out WARNING: CPU: 7 PID: 70 at drivers/gpu/drm/drm_atomic_helper.c:1835 drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_vblanks.part.0+0x24c/0x27c [...] Hardware name: MediaTek Genio-700 EVK (DT) Workqueue: events_unbound commit_work pstate: 60400009 (nZCv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--) pc : drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_vblanks.part.0+0x24c/0x27c lr : drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_vblanks.part.0+0x24c/0x27c sp : ffff80008337bca0 x29: ffff80008337bcd0 x28: 0000000000000061 x27: 0000000000000000 x26: 0000000000000001 x25: 0000000000000000 x24: ffff0000c9dcc000 x23: 0000000000000001 x22: 0000000000000000 x21: ffff0000c66f2f80 x20: ffff0000c0d7d880 x19: 0000000000000000 x18: 000000000000000a x17: 000000040044ffff x16: 005000f2b5503510 x15: 0000000000000000 x14: 0000000000000000 x13: 74756f2064656d69 x12: 742074696177206b x11: 0000000000000058 x10: 0000000000000018 x9 : ffff800082396a70 x8 : 0000000000057fa8 x7 : 0000000000000cce x6 : ffff8000823eea70 x5 : ffff0001fef5f408 x4 : ffff80017ccee000 x3 : ffff0000c12cb480 x2 : 0000000000000000 x1 : 0000000000000000 x0 : ffff0000c12cb480 Call trace:  drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_vblanks.part.0+0x24c/0x27c (P)  drm_atomic_helper_commit_tail_rpm+0x64/0x80  commit_tail+0xa4/0x1a4  commit_work+0x14/0x20  process_one_work+0x150/0x290  worker_thread+0x2d0/0x3ec  kthread+0x12c/0x210  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20 ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]--- ```  Until this gets fixed upstream, disable AFBC support on this platform, as it's currently broken with upstream Mesa.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.63-1"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.57-1","6.12.57-1~bpo12+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68184.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.17.8-1"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.57-1","6.12.57-1~bpo12+1","6.12.63-1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.10-1","6.16.11-1","6.16.12-1","6.16.12-1~bpo13+1","6.16.12-2","6.16.3-1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16.5-1","6.16.6-1","6.16.7-1","6.16.8-1","6.16.9-1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1","6.17.2-1~exp1","6.17.5-1~exp1","6.17.6-1","6.17.7-1","6.17.7-2","6.17.8-1~bpo13+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68184.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-68184"}]}
