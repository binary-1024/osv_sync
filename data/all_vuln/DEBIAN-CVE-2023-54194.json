Allocating memory failed where exfat fs use kmalloc_array due to system memory fragmentation, while the u-disk was inserted without recognition. Devices such as u-disk using the exfat file system are pluggable and may be insert into the system at any time. However, long-term running systems cannot guarantee the continuity of physical memory. Therefore, it's necessary to address this issue.
