{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-59149","published":"2025-10-01T20:07:44Z","modified":"2025-11-05T19:43:07.655982Z","aliases":["GHSA-vxcg-38x4-gj7j"],"summary":"Suricata: Stack buffer overflow in rule parser when processing long keywords with transforms","details":"Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. In version 8.0.0, rules using keyword ldap.responses.attribute_type (which is long) with transforms can lead to a stack buffer overflow during Suricata startup or during a rule reload. This issue is fixed in version 8.0.1. To workaround this issue, users can disable rules with ldap.responses.attribute_type and transforms.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"38a2cba5c397002047d84645f5ab770ff88020e1"}]}],"versions":["suricata-0.8.2","suricata-1.0.0","suricata-1.0.1","suricata-1.0.2","suricata-1.1","suricata-1.1beta1","suricata-1.1beta2","suricata-1.1beta3","suricata-1.1rc1","suricata-1.2","suricata-1.2.1","suricata-1.2beta1","suricata-1.2rc1","suricata-1.3","suricata-1.3.1","suricata-1.3beta1","suricata-1.3beta2","suricata-1.3rc1","suricata-1.4","suricata-1.4beta1","suricata-1.4beta2","suricata-1.4beta3","suricata-1.4rc1","suricata-2.0","suricata-2.0.1","suricata-2.0.1rc1","suricata-2.0.2","suricata-2.0beta1","suricata-2.0beta2","suricata-2.0rc1","suricata-2.0rc2","suricata-2.0rc3","suricata-2.1beta1","suricata-2.1beta2","suricata-2.1beta3","suricata-2.1beta4","suricata-3.0","suricata-3.0.1","suricata-3.0.1RC1","suricata-3.0RC1","suricata-3.0RC2","suricata-3.0RC3","suricata-3.1","suricata-3.1.1","suricata-3.1.2","suricata-3.1RC1","suricata-3.2","suricata-3.2.1","suricata-3.2RC1","suricata-3.2beta1","suricata-4.0.0","suricata-4.0.0-beta1","suricata-4.0.0-rc1","suricata-4.0.0-rc2","suricata-4.0.1","suricata-4.1.0","suricata-4.1.0-beta1","suricata-4.1.0-rc1","suricata-4.1.0-rc2","suricata-4.1.1","suricata-4.1.2","suricata-5.0.0","suricata-5.0.0-beta1","suricata-5.0.0-rc1","suricata-5.0.1","suricata-6.0.0","suricata-6.0.0-beta1","suricata-6.0.0-rc1","suricata-6.0.1","suricata-7.0.0","suricata-7.0.0-beta1","suricata-7.0.0-rc1","suricata-7.0.0-rc2","suricata-7.0.1","suricata-7.0.2","suricata-8.0.0","suricata-8.0.0-beta1","suricata-8.0.0-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-59149.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"246716000966071891689352228662048327144","length":553},"id":"CVE-2025-59149-95b41533","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata/commit/38a2cba5c397002047d84645f5ab770ff88020e1","target":{"file":"src/util-misc.c","function":"ShortenString"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["192113999744537312311160510684165180869","223654191433175668963539210523796752458","54712696253789251392596502336281188804","309528896202963133257098826634540341289","230107285276929107735184772905275462952","50197354667723421573547377497826939983","114791121792774310041567583940928441398","336607941240978094070149117016016275049","198100600462240161439585683353531908832","328845915896372637977269501017989663089","258514873277367801101161069278392095341","331115911061212807875011653066057665280"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2025-59149-ce8370b2","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata/commit/38a2cba5c397002047d84645f5ab770ff88020e1","target":{"file":"src/util-misc.c"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://forum.suricata.io/t/suricata-8-0-1-and-7-0-12-released/6018"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/38a2cba5c397002047d84645f5ab770ff88020e1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-vxcg-38x4-gj7j"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/7861"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-121"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
