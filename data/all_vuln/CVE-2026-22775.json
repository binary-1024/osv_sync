{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-22775","published":"2026-01-15T18:59:37.499Z","modified":"2026-01-22T05:48:26.959157Z","aliases":["GHSA-g2pg-6438-jwpf"],"summary":"devalue vulnerable to denial of service due to memory/CPU exhaustion in devalue.parse","details":"Svelte devalue is a JavaScript library that serializes values into strings when JSON.stringify isn't sufficient for the job. From 5.1.0 to 5.6.1, certain inputs can cause devalue.parse to consume excessive CPU time and/or memory, potentially leading to denial of service in systems that parse input from untrusted sources. This affects applications using devalue.parse on externally-supplied data. The root cause is the ArrayBuffer hydration expecting base64 encoded strings as input, but not checking the assumption before decoding the input. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.6.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/sveltejs/devalue","events":[{"introduced":"293d70bb7a3312741c370c8989fff0b5525647de"},{"fixed":"fcf4e88275f2e2e45b9ea70ffaa5247c8f55f057"}]}],"versions":["v5.1.0","v5.1.1","v5.3.0","v5.3.1","v5.3.2","v5.4.0","v5.4.1","v5.4.2","v5.5.0","v5.6.0","v5.6.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22775.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22775.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/devalue/commit/11755849fa0634ae294a15ec0aef2f43efcad7c4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/devalue/releases/tag/v5.6.2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/devalue/security/advisories/GHSA-g2pg-6438-jwpf"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22775"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-405"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22775.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
