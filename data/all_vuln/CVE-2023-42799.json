Moonlight-common-c is vulnerable to buffer overflow starting in commit 50c0a51b10ecc5b3415ea78c21d96d679e2288f9 due to unmitigated usage of unsafe C functions and improper bounds checking. A malicious game streaming server could exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability to crash a moonlight client, or achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the client (with insufficient exploit mitigations or if mitigations can be bypassed). The bug was addressed in commit 02b7742f4d19631024bd766bd2bb76715780004e.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-42799.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"50c0a51b10ecc5b3415ea78c21d96d679e2288f9"},{"fixed":"02b7742f4d19631024bd766bd2bb76715780004e"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-common-c/security/advisories/GHSA-r8cf-45f4-vf8m"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-common-c/commit/02b7742f4d19631024bd766bd2bb76715780004e"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-common-c/commit/50c0a51b10ecc5b3415ea78c21d96d679e2288f9"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
