  "details": "Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. The main purpose of this\nsoftware is the integration with mail servers (attachment scanning). The\npackage provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon, a command\nline scanner, and a tool for automatic updating via Internet. The programs\nare based on a shared library distributed with the Clam AntiVirus package,\nwhich you can use with your own software. The virus database is based on\nthe virus database from OpenAntiVirus, but contains additional signatures\n(including signatures for popular polymorphic viruses, too) and is KEPT UP\nTO DATE.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability in the PDF scanning processes of ClamAV could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition, cause a denial of service (DoS) condition, or execute arbitrary code on an affected device.\n\nThis vulnerability exists because memory buffers are allocated incorrectly when PDF files are processed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted PDF file to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a buffer overflow, likely resulting in the termination of the ClamAV scanning process and a DoS condition on the affected software. Although unproven, there is also a possibility that an attacker could leverage the buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ClamAV process.(CVE-2025-20260)",
