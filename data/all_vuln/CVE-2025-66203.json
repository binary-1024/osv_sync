Prior to version 251126, a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the stream-vault application (SpiritApplication). The application allows administrators to configure yt-dlp arguments via the /admin/api/saveConfig endpoint without sufficient validation. These arguments are stored globally and subsequently used in YtDlpUtil.java when constructing the command line to execute yt-dlp. This issue has been patched in version 251126.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lemon8866/streamvault","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ad164416df556341330e15210a7e8b38a0db411b"}]}],"versions":["251118","251126"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66203.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66203.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/lemon8866/StreamVault/releases/tag/251226"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/lemon8866/StreamVault/security/advisories/GHSA-c747-q388-3v6m"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66203"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-78"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66203.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
