{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-22105","published":"2025-04-16T15:16:04Z","modified":"2025-11-04T16:09:58.883678Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-22105"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bonding: check xdp prog when set bond mode  Following operations can trigger a warning[1]:      ip netns add ns1     ip netns exec ns1 ip link add bond0 type bond mode balance-rr     ip netns exec ns1 ip link set dev bond0 xdp obj af_xdp_kern.o sec xdp     ip netns exec ns1 ip link set bond0 type bond mode broadcast     ip netns del ns1  When delete the namespace, dev_xdp_uninstall() is called to remove xdp program on bond dev, and bond_xdp_set() will check the bond mode. If bond mode is changed after attaching xdp program, the warning may occur.  Some bond modes (broadcast, etc.) do not support native xdp. Set bond mode with xdp program attached is not good. Add check for xdp program when set bond mode.
