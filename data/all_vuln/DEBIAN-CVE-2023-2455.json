This scenario can happen under security definer functions or when a common user and query is planned initially and then re-used across multiple SET ROLEs. Applying an incorrect policy may permit a user to complete otherwise-forbidden reads and modifications. This affects only databases that have used CREATE POLICY to define a row security policy.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"postgresql-13","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/postgresql-13?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"13.11-0+deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["13.10-0+deb11u1","13.3-1","13.4-0+deb11u1","13.4-1","13.4-2","13.4-3","13.5-0+deb11u1","13.7-0+deb11u1","13.8-0+deb11u1","13.9-0+deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-2455.json"}},{"package":{"name":"postgresql-15","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/postgresql-15?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"15.3-0+deb12u1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-2455.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2455"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
