It has been rated as problematic.Using CWE to declare the problem leads to CWE-362. The product contains a code sequence that can run concurrently with other code, and the code sequence requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence that is operating concurrently.Impacted is confidentiality.Applying a patch is able to eliminate this problem. A possible mitigation has been published immediately after the disclosure of the vulnerability.(CVE-2024-35255)",
