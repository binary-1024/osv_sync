The Swift object store and proxy server are saving (unhashed) tokens retrieved from the Swauth middleware authentication mechanism to a log file as part of a GET URI. This allows attackers to bypass authentication by inserting a token into an X-Auth-Token header of a new request. NOTE: github.com/openstack/swauth URLs do not mean that Swauth is maintained by an official OpenStack project team.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"swauth","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/swauth@1.0.4-0ubuntu1.16.04.1?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.4-0ubuntu1","1.0.4-0ubuntu1.16.04.1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"python-swauth","binary_version":"1.0.4-0ubuntu1.16.04.1"},{"binary_name":"swauth","binary_version":"1.0.4-0ubuntu1.16.04.1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2017/UBUNTU-CVE-2017-16613.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2017-16613"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/+bug/1655781"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-16613"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
