  "details": "\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because it mishandles message verification failures when curl does FTP transfers secured by krb5. This flaw makes it possible for a Man-in-the-middle attack to go unnoticed and allows data injection into the client.(CVE-2022-32208)\r\n\r\nA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because the number of acceptable &quot;links&quot; in the &quot;decompression chain&quot; was unbounded, allowing a malicious server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps. This flaw leads to a denial of service, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.(CVE-2022-32206)\r\n\r\nA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because when curl saves cookies, alt-svc, and HSTS data to local files, it makes the operation atomic by finalizing the process with a rename from a temporary name to the final target file name. This flaw leads to unpreserved file permissions, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.(CVE-2022-32207)\r\n\r\nA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because a malicious server can serve excessive amounts of `Set-Cookie:` headers in an HTTP response to curl, which stores all of them. This flaw leads to a denial of service, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.(CVE-2022-32205)",
