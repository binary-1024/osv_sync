3.1.2, and 3.1.3-development before 2017-12-03, does not check for fnamecmp filenames in the daemon_filter_list data structure (in the recv_files function in receiver.c) and also does not apply the sanitize_paths protection mechanism to pathnames found in \"xname follows\" strings (in the read_ndx_and_attrs function in rsync.c), which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.2-r7"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-17434.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.2-r7"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-17434.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.2-r7"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-17434.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.2-r7"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-17434.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.2-r7"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-17434.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.2-r7"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-17434.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.2-r7"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-17434.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.2-r7"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-17434.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.2-r7"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-17434.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.2-r7"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-17434.j
