{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-24054","published":"2026-01-29T17:16:56.418Z","modified":"2026-01-30T22:54:34.148609Z","aliases":["GHSA-5fc8-gg7w-3g5c"],"summary":"Kata Containers Runtime: Host block device can be hotplugged to the VM if the container image is malformed or contains no layers","details":"Kata Containers is an open source project focusing on a standard implementation of lightweight Virtual Machines (VMs) that perform like containers. In versions prior to 3.26.0, when a container image is malformed or contains no layers, containerd falls back to bind-mounting an empty snapshotter directory for the container rootfs. When the Kata runtime attempts to mount the container rootfs, the bind mount causes the rootfs to be detected as a block device, leading to the underlying device being hotplugged to the guest. This can cause filesystem-level errors on the host due to double inode allocation, and may lead to the host's block device being mounted as read-only. Version 3.26.0 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b85393e70b041e6d53f886ace84b5fb62fe70dc0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-rc0","1.11.0-alpha0","1.11.0-alpha1","1.11.0-rc0","1.9.3","2.0.0-alpha1","2.0.0-alpha2","2.0.0-alpha3","2.0.0-rc0","2.1-alpha0","2.1-alpha1","2.1.0-alpha0","2.1.0-alpha1","2.1.0-alpha2","2.1.0-rc0","2.2.0-alpha0","2.2.0-alpha1","2.2.0-rc0","2.3.0-alpha0","2.3.0-alpha1","2.3.0-alpha2","2.3.0-rc0","2.4.0-alpha0","2.4.0-alpha1","2.4.0-alpha2","2.4.0-rc0","2.5.0-alpha0","2.5.0-alpha1","2.5.0-alpha2","2.5.0-rc0","3.0.0-alpha0","3.0.0-alpha1","3.0.0-rc0","3.1.0-alpha0","3.1.0-alpha1","3.1.0-rc0","3.10.0","3.10.1","3.11.0","3.12.0","3.13.0","3.14.0","3.15.0","3.16.0","3.17.0","3.18.0","3.19.0","3.19.1","3.2.0-alpha0","3.2.0-alpha1","3.2.0-alpha2","3.2.0-alpha3","3.2.0-alpha4","3.2.0-rc0","3.20.0","3.21.0","3.22.0","3.23.0","3.24.0","3.25.0","3.3.0","3.3.0-alpha0","3.3.0-test","3.4.0","3.5.0","3.6.0","3.7.0","3.8.0","3.9.0","release-3.4.0","untagged-b5b6198308b02e3a2666","untagged-c2a61792b39392572d0f"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24054.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24054.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/d939b6af5f8536c2cae85e919e7c40070557df0e/plugins/snapshots/overlay/overlay.go#L564-L581"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/a164693e1afead84cd01d5bc3575e2cbfe64ce35/src/runtime/virtcontainers/container.go#L1122-L1126"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/c7d0c270ee7dfaa6d978e6e07b99dabdaf2b9fda/src/runtime/virtcontainers/container.go#L1616-L1623"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/commit/20ca4d2d79aa5bf63aa1254f08915da84f19e92a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/security/advisories/GHSA-5fc8-gg7w-3g5c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24054"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-754"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24054.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:H/SA:H/E:P"}]}
