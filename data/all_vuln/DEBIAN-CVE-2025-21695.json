This ordering can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in the serdev controller's receive_buf handler, as it assumes serdev->ops is valid when SERPORT_ACTIVE is set.  This is similar to the issue fixed in commit 5e700b384ec1 (\"platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: properly fix race condition\") where devm_serdev_device_open() was called before fully initializing the device.  Fix the race by ensuring client ops are set before enabling the port via devm_serdev_device_open().  Note, serdev_device_set_baudrate() and serdev_device_set_flow_control() calls should be after the devm_serdev_device_open() call.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.11-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-21695.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.11-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-21695.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-21695"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
