In other words, KAuth unintentionally causes this plugin code to run as root, which increases the severity of any possible exploitation of a plugin vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kauth","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:Pro:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/kauth@5.18.0-0ubuntu2+esm1?arch=source&distro=esm-apps/xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.0-0ubuntu2+esm1"}]}],"versions":["5.15.0-0ubuntu1","5.15.0-0ubuntu2","5.18.0-0ubuntu1","5.18.0-0ubuntu2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"Available with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro","binaries":[{"binary_name":"libkf5auth-bin-dev","binary_version":"5.18.0-0ubuntu2+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libkf5auth-data","binary_version":"5.18.0-0ubuntu2+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libkf5auth-dev","binary_version":"5.18.0-0ubuntu2+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libkf5auth5","binary_version":"5.18.0-0ubuntu2+esm1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2019/UBUNTU-CVE-2019-7443.json"}},{"package":{"name":"kauth","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:Pro:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/kauth@5.44.0-0ubuntu1+esm1?arch=source&distro=esm-apps/bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.44.0-0ubuntu1+esm1"}]}],"versions":["5.38.0-0ubuntu1","5.40.0-0ubuntu1","5.41.0-0ubuntu1","5.42.0-0ubuntu1","5.43.0-0ubuntu1","5.44.0-0ubuntu1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"Available with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro","binaries":[{"binary_name":"libkf5auth-bin-dev","binary_version":"5.44.0-0ubuntu1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libkf5auth-data","binary_version":"5.44.0-0ubuntu1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libkf5auth-dev","binary_version":"5.44.0-0ubuntu1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libkf5auth5","binary_version":"5.44.0-0ubuntu1+esm1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2019/UBUNTU-CVE-2019-7443.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-7443"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/kde-announce/2019-February/000011.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://cgit.kde.org/kauth.git/commit/?id=fc70fb0161c1b9144d26389434d34dd135cd3f4a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6035-1"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-7443"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
