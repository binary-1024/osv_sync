When decoding the image data from a specially crafted .pcx file, a heap-based buffer overflow can occur which allows for remote code execution. An attacker will need to convince the library to read a file to trigger this vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"sail","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/sail@0.9.0+repack-2.1build1?arch=source&distro=noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.9.0+repack-1","0.9.0+repack-2","0.9.0+repack-2.1","0.9.0+repack-2.1build1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"libsail-c++-dev","binary_version":"0.9.0+repack-2.1build1"},{"binary_name":"libsail-c++0t64","binary_version":"0.9.0+repack-2.1build1"},{"binary_name":"libsail-common-dev","binary_version":"0.9.0+repack-2.1build1"},{"binary_name":"libsail-common0t64","binary_version":"0.9.0+repack-2.1build1"},{"binary_name":"libsail-dev","binary_version":"0.9.0+repack-2.1build1"},{"binary_name":"libsail-manip-dev","binary_version":"0.9.0+repack-2.1build1"},{"binary_name":"libsail-manip0t64","binary_version":"0.9.0+repack-2.1build1"},{"binary_name":"libsail0t64","binary_version":"0.9.0+repack-2.1build1"},{"binary_name":"sail-codecs","binary_version":"0.9.0+repack-2.1build1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-35984.json"}},{"package":{"name":"sail","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.10","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/sail@0.9.9-1?arch=source&distro=questing"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.9.7-1build1","0.9.8-1","0.9.9-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"libsail-c++-dev","binary_version":"0.9.9-1"},{"binary_name":"libsail-c++0t64","binary_version":"0.9.9-1"},{"binary_name":"libsail-common-dev","binary_version":"0.9.9-1"},{"binary_name":"libsail-common0t64","binary_version":"0.9.9-1"},{"binary_name":"libsail-dev","binary_version":"0.9.9-1"},{"binary_name":"libsail-manip-dev","binary_version":"0.9.9-1"},{"binary_name":"libsail-manip0t64","binary_version":"0.9.9-1"},{"binary_name":"libsail0t64","binary_version":"0.9.9-1"},{"binary_name":"sail-codecs","binary_version":"0.9.9-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-35984.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-35984"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-35984"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2025-2217"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
