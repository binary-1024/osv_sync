{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-21433","published":"2026-01-02T19:00:22.611Z","modified":"2026-01-13T20:11:38.936185Z","aliases":["GHSA-6rwr-c8hc-mjj4"],"summary":"Emlog vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)","details":"Emlog is an open source website building system. Versions up to and including 2.5.19 are vulnerable to server-side Out-of-Band (OOB) requests / SSRF via uploaded SVG files. An attacker can upload a crafted SVG to http[:]//emblog/admin/media[.]php which contains external resource references. When the server processes/renders the SVG (thumbnailing, preview, or sanitization), it issues an HTTP request to the attacker-controlled host. Impact: server-side SSRF/OOB leading to internal network probing and potential metadata/credential exposure. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/emlog/emlog","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"4c6745bec558ff11e7a83e69b1d2441d8840802f"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"2.5.19"}]}}],"versions":["5.3.1","6.0.0","6.1.0","ci","emlog_5.1.2","emlog_5.1.3","emlog_5.2.0","emlog_5.2.1","emlog_5.3.0","pro-1.0.1","pro-1.0.2","pro-1.0.3","pro-1.0.4","pro-1.0.5","pro-1.0.6","pro-1.0.7","pro-1.0.8","pro-1.1.0","pro-1.1.1","pro-1.2.0","pro-1.2.1","pro-1.2.2","pro-1.3.0","pro-1.3.1","pro-1.4.0","pro-1.5.0","pro-1.5.0.new","pro-1.5.1","pro-1.6.0","pro-1.7.0","pro-1.7.1","pro-1.8.0","pro-1.9.0","pro-1.9.1","pro-1.9.2","pro-1.9.3","pro-2.0.0","pro-2.0.1","pro-2.0.2","pro-2.0.3","pro-2.1.0","pro-2.1.1","pro-2.1.10","pro-2.1.11","pro-2.1.12","pro-2.1.13","pro-2.1.14","pro-2.1.15","pro-2.1.2","pro-2.1.3","pro-2.1.4","pro-2.1.5","pro-2.1.6","pro-2.1.7","pro-2.1.8","pro-2.1.9","pro-2.2.0","pro-2.2.1","pro-2.2.10","pro-2.2.11","pro-2.2.2","pro-2.2.3","pro-2.2.4","pro-2.2.5","pro-2.2.6","pro-2.2.7","pro-2.2.8","pro-2.2.9","pro-2.3.0","pro-2.3.1","pro-2.3.10","pro-2.3.11","pro-2.3.12","pro-2.3.13","pro-2.3.14","pro-2.3.15","pro-2.3.16","pro-2.3.17","pro-2.3.18","pro-2.3.2","pro-2.3.3","pro-2.3.4","pro-2.3.5","pro-2.3.6","pro-2.3.7","pro-2.3.8","pro-2.3.9","pro-2.4.0","pro-2.4.1","pro-2.4.2","pro-2.4.3","pro-2.5.1","pro-2.5.10","pro-2.5.11","pro-2.5.12","pro-2.5.13","pro-2.5.14","pro-2.5.15","pro-2.5.16","pro-2.5.17","pro-2.5.18","pro-2.5.19","pro-2.5.2","pro-2.5.3","pro-2.5.4","pro-2.5.5","pro-2.5.6","pro-2.5.7","pro-2.5.8","pro-2.5.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-21433.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/21xxx/CVE-2026-21433.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/emlog/emlog/security/advisories/GHSA-6rwr-c8hc-mjj4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-21433"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-918"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/21xxx/CVE-2026-21433.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
