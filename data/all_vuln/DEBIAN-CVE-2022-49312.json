{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49312","published":"2025-02-26T07:01:07Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:15:51.733797Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-49312"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  staging: rtl8712: fix a potential memory leak in r871xu_drv_init()  In r871xu_drv_init(), if r8712_init_drv_sw() fails, then the memory allocated by r8712_alloc_io_queue() in r8712_usb_dvobj_init() is not properly released as there is no action will be performed by r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit(). To properly release it, we should call r8712_free_io_queue() in r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit().  Besides, in r871xu_dev_remove(), r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit() will be called by r871x_dev_unload() under condition `padapter->bup` and r8712_free_io_queue() is called by r8712_free_drv_sw(). However, r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit() does not rely on `padapter->bup` and calling r8712_free_io_queue() in r8712_free_drv_sw() is negative for better understading the code. So I move r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit() into r871xu_dev_remove(), and remove r8712_free_io_queue() from r8712_free_drv_sw().","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.127-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.103-1","5.10.103-1~bpo10+1","5.10.106-1","5.10.113-1","5.10.120-1","5.10.120-1~bpo10+1","5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1","5.10.92-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49312.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49312.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49312.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49312.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-49312"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
