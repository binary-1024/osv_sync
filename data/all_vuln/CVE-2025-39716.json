  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nparisc: Revise __get_user() to probe user read access\n\nBecause of the way read access support is implemented, read access\ninterruptions are only triggered at privilege levels 2 and 3. The\nkernel executes at privilege level 0, so __get_user() never triggers\na read access interruption (code 26). Thus, it is currently possible\nfor user code to access a read protected address via a system call.\n\nFix this by probing read access rights at privilege level 3 (PRIV_USER)\nand setting __gu_err to -EFAULT (-14) if access isn't allowed.\n\nNote the cmpiclr instruction does a 32-bit compare because COND macro\ndoesn't work inside asm.",
