{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22865","published":"2026-01-16T23:15:50.280Z","modified":"2026-01-17T11:09:40.342895Z","upstream":["CVE-2026-22865"],"details":"Gradle is a build automation tool, and its native-platform tool provides Java bindings for native APIs. When resolving dependencies in versions before 9.3.0, some exceptions were not treated as fatal errors and would not cause a repository to be disabled. If a build encountered one of these exceptions, Gradle would continue to the next repository in the list and potentially resolve dependencies from a different repository. An exception like NoHttpResponseException can indicate transient errors. If the errors persist after a maximum number of retries, Gradle would continue to the next repository. This behavior could allow an attacker to disrupt the service of a repository and leverage another repository to serve malicious artifacts. This attack requires the attacker to have control over a repository after the disrupted repository. Gradle has introduced a change in behavior in Gradle 9.3.0 to stop searching other repositories when encountering these errors.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gradle","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gradle?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.4.1-13","4.4.1-14","4.4.1-15","4.4.1-16","4.4.1-17","4.4.1-18","4.4.1-19","4.4.1-20","4.4.1-21","4.4.1-22"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22865.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gradle","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gradle?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.4.1-18","4.4.1-19","4.4.1-20","4.4.1-21","4.4.1-22"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22865.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gradle","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gradle?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.4.1-22"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22865.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gradle","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gradle?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.4.1-22"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22865.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2026-22865"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:H/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
