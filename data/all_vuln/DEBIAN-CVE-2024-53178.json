{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-53178","published":"2024-12-27T14:15:25Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:19:51.691257Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-53178"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smb: Don't leak cfid when reconnect races with open_cached_dir  open_cached_dir() may either race with the tcon reconnection even before compound_send_recv() or directly trigger a reconnection via SMB2_open_init() or SMB_query_info_init().  The reconnection process invokes invalidate_all_cached_dirs() via cifs_mark_open_files_invalid(), which removes all cfids from the cfids->entries list but doesn't drop a ref if has_lease isn't true. This results in the currently-being-constructed cfid not being on the list, but still having a refcount of 2. It leaks if returned from open_cached_dir().  Fix this by setting cfid->has_lease when the ref is actually taken; the cfid will not be used by other threads until it has a valid time.
