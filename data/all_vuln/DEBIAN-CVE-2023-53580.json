The panic involves a somewhat complicated interaction between the kernel driver and a userspace component (as described in the Link tag below), but the analysis did make one thing clear: The Gadget core should accomodate gadget drivers calling usb_gadget_deactivate() as part of their unbind procedure.  Currently this doesn't work.  gadget_unbind_driver() calls driver->unbind() while holding the udc->connect_lock mutex, and usb_gadget_deactivate() attempts to acquire that mutex, which will result in a deadlock.  The simple fix is for gadget_unbind_driver() to release the mutex when invoking the ->unbind() callback.  There is no particular reason for it to be holding the mutex at that time, and the mutex isn't held while the ->bind() callback is invoked.  So we'll drop the mutex before performing the unbind callback and reacquire it afterward.  We'll also add a couple of comments to usb_gadget_activate() and usb_gadget_deactivate().  Because they run in process context they must not be called from a gadget driver's ->disconnect() callback, which (according to the kerneldoc for struct usb_gadget_driver in include/linux/usb/gadget.h) may run in interrupt context.  This may help prevent similar bugs from arising in the future.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.52-1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.27-1","6.1.37-1","6.1.38-1","6.1.38-2","6.1.38-2~bpo11+1","6.1.38-3","6.1.38-4","6.1.38-4~bpo11+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53580.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.4.11-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53580.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.4.11-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53580.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-53580"}]}
