It is possible to leave some data in nghttp2 memory after reset when headers with HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frame are sent to the server and then a TCP connection is abruptly closed by the client triggering the Http2Session destructor while header frames are still being processed (and stored in memory) causing a race condition.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240510-0002/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/2319584"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JDECX4BYZLMM4S4LALN4DPZ2HUTTPLKE/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YDVFUH7ACZPYB3BS4SVILNOY7NQU73VW/"}]}
