In syscall.StartProcess and os/exec.Cmd, invalid environment variable values containing NUL values are not properly checked for. A malicious environment variable value can exploit this behavior to set a value for a different environment variable. For example, the environment variable string \"A=B\\x00C=D\" sets the variables \"A=B\" and \"C=D\".","affected":[{"package":{"name":"golang-1.15","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-1.15?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.15.15-1","1.15.15-1~deb11u1","1.15.15-1~deb11u2","1.15.15-1~deb11u3","1.15.15-1~deb11u4","1.15.15-2","1.15.15-3","1.15.15-4","1.15.15-5","1.15.9-6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-41716.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-1.19","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-1.19?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.19.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-41716.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-41716"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
