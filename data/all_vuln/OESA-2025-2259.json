The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that &quot;A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.&quot; Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/(CVE-2024-45337)\n\nA flaw was found in Go. When FIPS mode is enabled on a system, container runtimes may incorrectly handle certain file paths due to improper validation in the containers/common Go library. This flaw allows an attacker to exploit symbolic links and trick the system into mounting sensitive host directories inside a container. This issue also allows attackers to access critical host files, bypassing the intended isolation between containers and the host system.(CVE-2024-9341)\n\nA vulnerability exists in the bind-propagation option of the Dockerfile RUN --mount instruction. The system does not properly validate the input passed to this option, allowing users to pass arbitrary parameters to the mount instruction. This issue can be exploited to mount sensitive directories from the host into a container during the build process and, in some cases, modify the contents of those mounted files. Even if SELinux is used, this vulnerability can bypass its protection by allowing the source directory to be relabeled to give the container access to host files.(CVE-2024-9407)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"buildah","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/buildah&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.34.1-10.oe2403sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["buildah-1.34.1-10.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","buildah-debuginfo-1.34.1-10.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","buildah-debugsource-1.34.1-10.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","buildah-tests-1.34.1-10.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["buildah-1.34.1-10.oe2403sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["buildah-1.34.1-10.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","buildah-debuginfo-1.34.1-10.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","buildah-debugsource-1.34.1-10.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","buildah-tests-1.34.1-10.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2259.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2259"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45337"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9341"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9407"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Critical"}}
