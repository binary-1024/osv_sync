  "details": "HAProxy is a free, very fast and reliable solution offering high availability, load balancing, and proxying for TCP and HTTP-based applications. It is particularly suited for very high traffic web sites and powers quite a number of the world&apos;s most visited ones.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in HAProxy 2.2 before 2.2.16, 2.3 before 2.3.13, and 2.4 before 2.4.3. It does not ensure that the scheme and path portions of a URI have the expected characters. For example, the authority field (as observed on a target HTTP/2 server) might differ from what the routing rules were intended to achieve.(CVE-2021-39240)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in HAProxy 2.0 before 2.0.24, 2.2 before 2.2.16, 2.3 before 2.3.13, and 2.4 before 2.4.3. An HTTP method name may contain a space followed by the name of a protected resource. It is possible that a server would interpret this as a request for that protected resource, such as in the &quot;GET /admin? HTTP/1.1 /static/images HTTP/1.1&quot; example.(CVE-2021-39241)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in HAProxy 2.2 before 2.2.16, 2.3 before 2.3.13, and 2.4 before 2.4.3. It can lead to a situation with an attacker-controlled HTTP Host header, because a mismatch between Host and authority is mishandled.(CVE-2021-39242)",
