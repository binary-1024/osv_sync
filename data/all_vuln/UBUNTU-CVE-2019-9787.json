This occurs because CSRF protection is mishandled, and because Search Engine Optimization of A elements is performed incorrectly, leading to XSS. The XSS results in administrative access, which allows arbitrary changes to .php files. This is related to wp-admin/includes/ajax-actions.php and wp-includes/comment.php.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wordpress","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/wordpress@4.4.2+dfsg-1ubuntu1?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.3+dfsg-1","4.3.1+dfsg-1","4.4+dfsg-1","4.4.1+dfsg-1","4.4.2+dfsg-1","4.4.2+dfsg-1ubuntu1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"wordpress","binary_version":"4.4.2+dfsg-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-l10n","binary_version":"4.4.2+dfsg-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-theme-twentyfifteen","binary_version":"4.4.2+dfsg-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-theme-twentyfourteen","binary_version":"4.4.2+dfsg-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-theme-twentysixteen","binary_version":"4.4.2+dfsg-1ubuntu1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2019/UBUNTU-CVE-2019-9787.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wordpress","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/wordpress@4.9.5+dfsg1-1?arch=source&distro=bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.8.2+dfsg-2","4.8.3+dfsg-1","4.9.1+dfsg-1","4.9.2+dfsg-1","4.9.4+dfsg-1","4.9.5+dfsg1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"wordpress","binary_version":"4.9.5+dfsg1-1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-l10n","binary_version":"4.9.5+dfsg1-1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-theme-twentyfifteen","binary_version":"4.9.5+dfsg1-1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-theme-twentyseventeen","binary_version":"4.9.5+dfsg1-1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-theme-twentysixteen","binary_version":"4.9.5+dfsg1-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2019/UBUNTU-CVE-2019-9787.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-9787"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://blog.ripstech.com/2019/wordpress-csrf-to-rce/"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commit/0292de60ec78c5a44956765189403654fe4d080b"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/03/wordpress-5-1-1-security-and-maintenance-release/"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://wordpress.org/support/wordpress-version/version-5-1-1/"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-9787"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
