NOTE: the software maintainer disputes that this is a vulnerability because ASLR for a.out format executables has never been supported","references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/04/18/5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107887"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/04/03/4"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/04/03/4/1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-06/msg00039.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/05/22/7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4006-1/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4006-2/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4007-1/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4007-2/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4008-1/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4008-3/"}],"database_specific":{"isDisputed":true},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
