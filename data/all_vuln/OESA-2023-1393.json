Quoting ZDI security advisory [1]:\n\n&quot;This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of the Linux Kernel. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of seg6 attributes. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.&quot;\n\n[1] https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-CAN-18511/(CVE-2023-2860)\n\nA known cache speculation vulnerability, known as Branch History Injection (BHI) or Spectre-BHB, becomes actual again for the new hw AmpereOne. Spectre-BHB is similar to Spectre v2, except that malicious code uses the shared branch history (stored in the CPU Branch History Buffer, or BHB) to influence mispredicted branches within the victim&apos;s hardware context. Once that occurs, speculation caused by the mispredicted branches can cause cache allocation. This issue leads to obtaining information that should not be accessible.(CVE-2023-3006)\n\nA use after free issue was discovered in driver/firewire in outbound_phy_packet_callback in the Linux Kernel. In this flaw a local attacker with special privilege may cause a use after free problem when queue_event() fails.(CVE-2023-3159)\n\nA flaw was found in the Framebuffer Console (fbcon) in the Linux Kernel. When providing font-&gt;width and font-&gt;height greater than 32 to fbcon_set_font, since there are no checks in place, a shift-out-of-bounds occurs leading to undefined behavior and possible denial of service.(CVE-2023-3161)\n\n** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.3. There is an out-of-bounds read in crc16 in lib/crc16.c when called from fs/ext4/super.c because ext4_group_desc_csum does not properly check an offset. NOTE: this is disputed by third parties because the kernel is not intended to defend against attackers with the stated &quot;When modifying the block device while it is mounted by the filesystem&quot; access.(CVE-2023-34256)\n\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.2. A use-after-free was found in saa7134_finidev in drivers/media/pci/saa7134/saa7134-core.c.(CVE-2023-35823)\n\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.2. A use-after-free was found in renesas_usb3_remove in drivers/usb/gadget/udc/renesas_usb3.c.(CVE-2023-35828)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kernel","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/kernel&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.aarch64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.aarch64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["kernel-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python3-perf-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.x86_64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.x86_64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2306.7.0.0208.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2023-1393.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2023-1393"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-2860"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3006"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3159"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3161"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34256"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35823"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35828"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
