  "summary": "org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-security-requiredrights-default required rights analysis doesn't consider TextAreas with default content type",
  "details": "### Impact\nWhen editing a page, XWiki warns since version 15.9 when there is content on the page like a script macro that would gain more rights due to the editing. This analysis doesn't consider certain kinds of properties, allowing a user to put malicious scripts in there that will be executed after a user with script, admin, or programming rights edited the page. Such a malicious script could impact the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation.\n\nTo reproduce, as a user without script right, create a class with a `TextArea` property, create page with an object of that class and a Velocity macro in its content. Then, as an admin, try editing that page. Normally, there should be a warning but in vulnerable versions of XWiki, there is no warning.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.10.8 and 16.2.0.\n\n### Workarounds\nWe're not aware of any workarounds apart from not editing pages that might have been edited by untrusted users as a user with script rights, e.g., by using separate user accounts for admin and non-admin tasks.",
