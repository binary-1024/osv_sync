The images parameter (submitted as images[] in a POST request) is reflected into an HTML href attribute without proper context-aware output encoding in include/tool/Editing.php. An authenticated attacker with editing privileges can supply a JavaScript pseudo-protocol (e.g., javascript:) to trigger arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the victim's browser session.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/typesetter/typesetter","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"d02debf46bf934ede31d60cafe27976ec344869c"}]}],"versions":["4.5rc1","4.5rc2","5.0-rc4","v4.3","v4.3.1","v4.3.2","v4.3.2b1","v4.3.2rc1","v4.3.2rc2","v4.3.3","v4.3.4","v4.3b1","v4.3b2","v4.3rc1","v4.3rc2","v4.3rc3","v4.4","v4.4b1","v4.4b2","v4.4b3","v4.4rc1","v4.4rc2","v4.5","v4.5b1","v4.5b2","v4.5b3","v4.6","v4.6.1","v4.6b1","v4.6b2","v4.6b3","v4.6rc1","v4.6rc2","v5.0","v5.0-rc1","v5.0-rc2","v5.0-rc3","v5.0.1","v5.0.2","v5.0.3","v5.0b1","v5.0b2","v5.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-71164.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/typesetter-cms-reflected-xss-via-editing-php"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/Typesetter/Typesetter/issues/706"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/Typesetter/Typesetter"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
