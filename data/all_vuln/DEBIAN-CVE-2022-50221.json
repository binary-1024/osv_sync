  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/fb-helper: Fix out-of-bounds access  Clip memory range to screen-buffer size to avoid out-of-bounds access in fbdev deferred I/O's damage handling.  Fbdev's deferred I/O can only track pages. From the range of pages, the damage handler computes the clipping rectangle for the display update. If the fbdev screen buffer ends near the beginning of a page, that page could contain more scanlines. The damage handler would then track these non-existing scanlines as dirty and provoke an out-of-bounds access during the screen update. Hence, clip the maximum memory range to the size of the screen buffer.  While at it, rename the variables min/max to min_off/max_off in drm_fb_helper_deferred_io(). This avoids confusion with the macros of the same name.",
