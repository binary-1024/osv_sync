An attacker who is able to submit a crafted file to an application linked with OpenEXR could cause an out-of-bounds read. The greatest risk from this flaw is to application availability.(CVE-2021-3598)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in OpenEXR before 2.4.1. Because of integer overflows in CompositeDeepScanLine::Data::handleDeepFrameBuffer and readSampleCountForLineBlock, an attacker can write to an out-of-bounds pointer.(CVE-2020-11759)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in OpenEXR before v2.5.2. Invalid chunkCount attributes could cause a heap buffer overflow in getChunkOffsetTableSize() in IlmImf/ImfMisc.cpp.(CVE-2020-15306)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in OpenEXR before 2.4.1. There is an std::vector out-of-bounds read and write, as demonstrated by ImfTileOffsets.cpp.(CVE-2020-11763)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in OpenEXR before 2.4.1. There is an out-of-bounds read during Huffman uncompression, as demonstrated by FastHufDecoder::refill in ImfFastHuf.cpp.(CVE-2020-11761)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in OpenEXR before 2.4.1. There is an off-by-one error in use of the ImfXdr.h read function by DwaCompressor::Classifier::Classifier, leading to an out-of-bounds read.(CVE-2020-11765)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in OpenEXR before 2.4.1. There is an out-of-bounds read during RLE uncompression in rleUncompress in ImfRle.cpp.(CVE-2020-11760)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in OpenEXR before 2.5.2. Invalid input could cause a use-after-free in DeepScanLineInputFile::DeepScanLineInputFile() in IlmImf/ImfDeepScanLineInputFile.cpp.(CVE-2020-15305)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in OpenEXR before 2.4.1. There is an out-of-bounds read in ImfOptimizedPixelReading.h.(CVE-2020-11758)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in OpenEXR before 2.4.1. There is an out-of-bounds write in copyIntoFrameBuffer in ImfMisc.cpp.(CVE-2020-11764)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in OpenEXR before 2.4.1. There is an out-of-bounds read and write in DwaCompressor::uncompress in ImfDwaCompressor.cpp when handling the UNKNOWN compression case.(CVE-2020-11762)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"OpenEXR","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/OpenEXR&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.2.0-22.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["OpenEXR-debuginfo-2.2.0-22.oe1.aarch64.rpm","OpenEXR-devel-2.2.0-22.oe1.aarch64.rpm","OpenEXR-libs-2.2.0-22.oe1.aarch64.rpm","OpenEXR-2.2.0-22.oe1.aarch64.rpm","OpenEXR-debugsource-2.2.0-22.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["OpenEXR-2.2.0-22.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["OpenEXR-devel-2.2.0-22.oe1.x86_64.rpm","OpenEXR-libs-2.2.0-22.oe1.x86_64.rpm","OpenEXR-debugsource-2.2.0-22.oe1.x86_64.rpm","OpenEXR-debuginfo-2.2.0-22.oe1.x86_64.rpm","OpenEXR-2.2.0-22.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1268.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1268"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3598"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11759"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15306"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11763"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11761"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11765"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11760"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15305"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11758"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11764"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11762"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
