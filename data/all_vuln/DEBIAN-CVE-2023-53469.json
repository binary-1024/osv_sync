{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53469","published":"2025-10-01T12:15:48Z","modified":"2025-10-02T09:25:39.879288Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-53469"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  af_unix: Fix null-ptr-deref in unix_stream_sendpage().  Bing-Jhong Billy Jheng reported null-ptr-deref in unix_stream_sendpage() with detailed analysis and a nice repro.  unix_stream_sendpage() tries to add data to the last skb in the peer's recv queue without locking the queue.  If the peer's FD is passed to another socket and the socket's FD is passed to the peer, there is a loop between them.  If we close both sockets without receiving FD, the sockets will be cleaned up by garbage collection.  The garbage collection iterates such sockets and unlinks skb with FD from the socket's receive queue under the queue's lock.  So, there is a race where unix_stream_sendpage() could access an skb locklessly that is being released by garbage collection, resulting in use-after-free.  To avoid the issue, unix_stream_sendpage() must lock the peer's recv queue.  Note the issue does not exist in 6.5+ thanks to the recent sendpage() refactoring.  This patch is originally written by Linus Torvalds.
