Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.3.1, if the TUF repository (or any of its mirrors) returns invalid TUF metadata JSON (valid JSON but not well formed TUF metadata), the client will panic during parsing, causing a denial of service. The panic happens before any signature is validated. This means that a compromised repository/mirror/cache can DoS clients without having access to any signing key. Version 2.3.1 fixes the issue. No known workarounds are available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf","events":[{"introduced":"ecec5d3a09cfa74482f0797fa38b65a2942a655c"},{"fixed":"b38d91fdbc69dfe31fe9230d97dafe527ea854a0"}]}],"versions":["v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.2.0","v2.3.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23991.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23991.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/commit/73345ab6b0eb7e59d525dac17a428f043074cef6"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/releases/tag/v2.3.1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/security/advisories/GHSA-846p-jg2w-w324"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23991"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-617","CWE-754"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23991.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
