In particular, it offers new paradigms for launching applications, accessing documents, and organizing open windows in GNOME. Later, it will introduce a new applets eco-system and offer new solutions for other desktop features, such as notifications and contacts management. The GNOME Shell is intended to replace functions handled by the GNOME Panel and by the window manager in previous versions of GNOME. The GNOME Shell has rich visual effects enabled by new graphical technologies.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in certain configurations of GNOME gnome-shell through 3.36.4. When logging out of an account, the password box from the login dialog reappears with the password still visible. If the user had decided to have the password shown in cleartext at login time, it is then visible for a brief moment upon a logout. (If the password were never shown in cleartext, only the password length is revealed.)(CVE-2020-17489)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gnome-shell","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/gnome-shell&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.30.1-8.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["gnome-shell-debuginfo-3.30.1-8.oe1.aarch64.rpm","gnome-shell-debugsource-3.30.1-8.oe1.aarch64.rpm","gnome-shell-3.30.1-8.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["gnome-shell-help-3.30.1-8.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["gnome-shell-3.30.1-8.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["gnome-shell-3.30.1-8.oe1.x86_64.rpm","gnome-shell-debugsource-3.30.1-8.oe1.x86_64.rpm","gnome-shell-debuginfo-3.30.1-8.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1152.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1152"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-17489"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
