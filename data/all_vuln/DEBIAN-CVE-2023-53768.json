This is currently handled by allocating a buffer to hold a pointer for each row (i.e. num_config_bases). After that, the logic attempts to allocate the memory required to hold the register configuration for each row. However, instead of doing this allocation for each row (i.e. num_config_bases allocations), the logic erroneously does this allocation num_config_regs number of times.  This scenario can lead to out-of-bounds accesses when num_config_regs is greater than num_config_bases. Fix this by updating the terminating condition of the loop that allocates the memory for holding the register configuration to allocate memory only for each row in the matrix.  Amit Pundir reported a crash that was occurring on his db845c device due to memory corruption (see \"Closes\" tag for Amit's report).
