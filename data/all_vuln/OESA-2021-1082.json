These components are used to provide access to a remote machine's display and devices.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nMultiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities were found in the QUIC image decoding process of the SPICE remote display system, before spice-0.14.2-1. Both the SPICE client (spice-gtk) and server are affected by these flaws. These flaws allow a malicious client or server to send specially crafted messages that, when processed by the QUIC image compression algorithm, result in a process crash or potential code execution.(CVE-2020-14355)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"spice","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/spice&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.14.3-2.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["spice-server-devel-0.14.3-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","spice-debugsource-0.14.3-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","spice-debuginfo-0.14.3-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","spice-server-0.14.3-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","spice-server-devel-0.14.3-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","spice-debugsource-0.14.3-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","spice-debuginfo-0.14.3-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","spice-server-0.14.3-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["spice-help-0.14.3-2.oe1.noarch.rpm","spice-help-0.14.3-2.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["spice-0.14.3-2.oe1.src.rpm","spice-0.14.3-2.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["spice-debuginfo-0.14.3-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","spice-server-devel-0.14.3-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","spice-server-0.14.3-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","spice-debugsource-0.14.3-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","spice-debuginfo-0.14.3-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","spice-server-devel-0.14.3-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","spice-server-0.14.3-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","spice-debugsource-0.14.3-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1082.json"}},{"package":{"name":"spice","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/spice&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.14.3-2.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["spice-server-devel-0.14.3-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","spice-debugsource-0.14.3-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","spice-debuginfo-0.14.3-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","spice-server-0.14.3-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["spice-help-0.14.3-2.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["spice-0.14.3-2.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["spice-debuginfo-0.14.3-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","spice-server-devel-0.14.3-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","spice-server-0.14.3-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","spice-debugsource-0.14.3-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1082.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1082"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14355"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
