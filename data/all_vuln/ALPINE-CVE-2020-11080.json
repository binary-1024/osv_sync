{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2020-11080","published":"2020-06-03T23:15:11Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:17:10.206190Z","upstream":["CVE-2020-11080"],"details":"In nghttp2 before version 1.41.0, the overly large HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame payload causes denial of service. The proof of concept attack involves a malicious client constructing a SETTINGS frame with a length of 14,400 bytes (2400 individual settings entries) over and over again. The attack causes the CPU to spike at 100%. nghttp2 v1.41.0 fixes this vulnerability. There is a workaround to this vulnerability. Implement nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback, and if received frame is SETTINGS frame and the number of settings entries are large (e.g., > 32), then drop the connection.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nghttp2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nghttp2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.39.2-r1"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-r0","1.11.0-r0","1.11.1-r0","1.12.0-r0","1.13.0-r0","1.14.0-r0","1.14.1-r0","1.15.0-r0","1.15.0-r1","1.16.0-r0","1.16.1-r0","1.17.0-r0","1.18.0-r0","1.18.0-r1","1.18.1-r0","1.2.0-r0","1.20.0-r0","1.21.0-r0","1.21.1-r0","1.21.1-r1","1.22.0-r0","1.23.1-r0","1.24.0-r0","1.25.0-r0","1.26.0-r0","1.27.0-r0","1.27.0-r1","1.28.0-r0","1.29.0-r0","1.3.0-r0","1.3.2-r0","1.3.4-r0","1.30.0-r0","1.31.0-r0","1.31.0-r1","1.31.1-r0","1.32.0-r0","1.33.0-r0","1.33.0-r1","1.34.0-r0","1.35.1-r0","1.36.0-r0","1.37.0-r0","1.37.0-r1","1.38.0-r0","1.39.1-r0","1.39.2-r0","1.5.0-r0","1.6.0-r0","1.7.0-r0","1.7.1-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.9.1-r0","1.9.2-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-11080.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nghttp2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nghttp2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.40.0-r1"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-r0","1.11.0-r0","1.11.1-r0","1.12.0-r0","1.13.0-r0","1.14.0-r0","1.14.1-r0","1.15.0-r0","1.15.0-r1","1.16.0-r0","1.16.1-r0","1.17.0-r0","1.18.0-r0","1.18.0-r1","1.18.1-r0","1.2.0-r0","1.20.0-r0","1.21.0-r0","1.21.1-r0","1.21.1-r1","1.22.0-r0","1.23.1-r0","1.24.0-r0","1.25.0-r0","1.26.0-r0","1.27.0-r0","1.27.0-r1","1.28.0-r0","1.29.0-r0","1.3.0-r0","1.3.2-r0","1.3.4-r0","1.30.0-r0","1.31.0-r0","1.31.0-r1","1.31.1-r0","1.32.0-r0","1.33.0-r0","1.33.0-r1","1.34.0-r0","1.35.1-r0","1.36.0-r0","1.37.0-r0","1.37.0-r1","1.38.0-r0","1.39.1-r0","1.39.2-r0","1.39.2-r1","1.39.2-r2","1.40.0-r0","1.5.0-r0","1.6.0-r0","1.7.0-r0","1.7.1-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.9.1-r0","1.9.2-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-11080.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nghttp2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nghttp2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.41.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-r0","1.11.0-r0","1.11.1-r0","1.12.0-r0","1.13.0-r0","1.14.0-r0","1.14.1-r0","1.15.0-r0","1.15.0-r1","1.16.0-r0","1.16.1-r0","1.17.0-r0","1.18.0-r0","1.18.0-r1","1.18.1-r0","1.2.0-r0","1.20.0-r0","1.21.0-r0","1.21.1-r0","1.21.1-r1","1.22.0-r0","1.23.1-r0","1.24.0-r0","1.25.0-r0","1.26.0-r0","1.27.0-r0","1.27.0-r1","1.28.0-r0","1.29.0-r0","1.3.0-r0","1.3.2-r0","1.3.4-r0","1.30.0-r0","1.31.0-r0","1.31.0-r1","1.31.1-r0","1.32.0-r0","1.33.0-r0","1.33.0-r1","1.34.0-r0","1.35.1-r0","1.36.0-r0","1.37.0-r0","1.37.0-r1","1.38.0-r0","1.39.1-r0","1.39.2-r0","1.39.2-r1","1.39.2-r2","1.40.0-r0","1.5.0-r0","1.6.0-r0","1.7.0-r0","1.7.1-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.9.1-r0","1.9.2-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-11080.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nghttp2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nghttp2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.41.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-r0","1.11.0-r0","1.11.1-r0","1.12.0-r0","1.13.0-r0","1.14.0-r0","1.14.1-r0","1.15.0-r0","1.15.0-r1","1.16.0-r0","1.16.1-r0","1.17.0-r0","1.18.0-r0","1.18.0-r1","1.18.1-r0","1.2.0-r0","1.20.0-r0","1.21.0-r0","1.21.1-r0","1.21.1-r1","1.22.0-r0","1.23.1-r0","1.24.0-r0","1.25.0-r0","1.26.0-r0","1.27.0-r0","1.27.0-r1","1.28.0-r0","1.29.0-r0","1.3.0-r0","1.3.2-r0","1.3.4-r0","1.30.0-r0","1.31.0-r0","1.31.0-r1","1.31.1-r0","1.32.0-r0","1.33.0-r0","1.33.0-r1","1.34.0-r0","1.35.1-r0","1.36.0-r0","1.37.0-r0","1.37.0-r1","1.38.0-r0","1.39.1-r0","1.39.2-r0","1.39.2-r1","1.39.2-r2","1.40.0-r0","1.5.0-r0","1.6.0-r0","1.7.0-r0","1.7.1-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.9.1-r0","1.9.2-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-11080.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nghttp2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nghttp2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.41.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-r0","1.11.0-r0","1.11.1-r0","1.12.0-r0","1.13.0-r0","1.14.0-r0","1.14.1-r0","1.15.0-r0","1.15.0-r1","1.16.0-r0","1.16.1-r0","1.17.0-r0","1.18.0-r0","1.18.0-r1","1.18.1-r0","1.2.0-r0","1.20.0-r0","1.21.0-r0","1.21.1-r0","1.21.1-r1","1.22.0-r0","1.23.1-r0","1.24.0-r0","1.25.0-r0","1.26.0-r0","1.27.0-r0","1.27.0-r1","1.28.0-r0","1.29.0-r0","1.3.0-r0","1.3.2-r0","1.3.4-r0","1.30.0-r0","1.31.0-r0","1.31.0-r1","1.31.1-r0","1.32.0-r0","1.33.0-r0","1.33.0-r1","1.34.0-r0","1.35.1-r0","1.36.0-r0","1.37.0-r0","1.37.0-r1","1.38.0-r0","1.39.1-r0","1.39.2-r0","1.39.2-r1","1.39.2-r2","1.40.0-r0","1.5.0-r0","1.6.0-r0","1.7.0-r0","1.7.1-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.9.1-r0","1.9.2-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-11080.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nghttp2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pk
