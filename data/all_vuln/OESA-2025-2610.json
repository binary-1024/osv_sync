It provides a simple C language application programming interface (API) to access the secure communications protocols as well as APIs to parse and write X.509, PKCS #12, and other required structures. The project strives to provide a secure communications back-end, simple to use and integrated with the rest of the base Linux libraries. A back-end designed to work and be secure out of the box, keeping the complexity of TLS and PKI out of application code.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA flaw was found in GnuTLS, which relies on libtasn1 for ASN.1 data processing. Due to an inefficient algorithm in libtasn1, decoding certain DER-encoded certificate data can take excessive time, leading to increased resource consumption. This flaw allows a remote attacker to send a specially crafted certificate, causing GnuTLS to become unresponsive or slow, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.(CVE-2024-12243)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gnutls","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/gnutls&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.14-18.oe2003sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["gnutls-3.6.14-18.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","gnutls-debuginfo-3.6.14-18.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","gnutls-debugsource-3.6.14-18.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","gnutls-devel-3.6.14-18.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","gnutls-utils-3.6.14-18.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["gnutls-help-3.6.14-18.oe2003sp4.noarch.rpm"],"src":["gnutls-3.6.14-18.oe2003sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["gnutls-3.6.14-18.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","gnutls-debuginfo-3.6.14-18.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","gnutls-debugsource-3.6.14-18.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","gnutls-devel-3.6.14-18.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","gnutls-utils-3.6.14-18.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2610.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2610"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-12243"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
