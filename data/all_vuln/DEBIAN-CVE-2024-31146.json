Therefore such a configuration cannot really be security-supported, yet making that explicit was so far missing.  Resources the sharing of which is known to be problematic include, but are not limited to - - PCI Base Address Registers (BARs) of multiple devices mapping to the   same page (4k on x86), - - INTx lines.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"xen","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xen?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.14.2+25-gb6a8c4f72d-2","4.14.3+32-g9de3671772-1","4.14.3+32-g9de3671772-1~deb11u1","4.14.3-1","4.14.3-1~deb11u1","4.14.4+74-gd7b22226b5-1","4.14.5+24-g87d90d511c-1","4.14.5+86-g1c354767d5-1","4.14.5+94-ge49571868d-1","4.14.6-1","4.16.0+51-g0941d6cb-1","4.16.0-1~exp1","4.16.1-1","4.16.2+90-g0d39a6d1ae-1","4.16.2-1","4.16.2-2","4.17.0+24-g2f8851c37f-2","4.17.0+24-g2f8851c37f-2~exp1","4.17.0+46-gaaf74a532c-1","4.17.0+74-g3eac216e6e-1","4.17.0-1","4.17.0~rc4-1~exp1","4.17.1+2-gb773c48e36-1","4.17.2+55-g0b56bed864-1","4.17.2+76-ge1f9cb16e2-1","4.17.2+76-ge1f9cb16e2-1~deb12u1","4.17.2-1","4.17.3+10-g091466ba55-1","4.17.3+10-g091466ba55-1.1","4.17.3+10-g091466ba55-1.1~exp1","4.17.3+10-g091466ba55-1.1~exp2","4.17.3+10-g091466ba55-1~deb12u1","4.17.3+36-g54dacb5c02-1","4.17.5+23-ga4e5191dc0-1","4.19.0+14-g0918434e0f-1~exp1","4.19.1-1","4.19.1-1~exp1","4.19.1-1~exp4","4.20.0+68-g35cb38b222-1","4.20.0-1","4.20.0~rc2+1-gfcde5e0de8-1~exp1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"end-of-life"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31146.json"}},{"package":{"name":"xen","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xen?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.17.5+23-ga4e5191dc0-1"}]}],"versions":["4.17.1+2-gb773c48e36-1","4.17.2+55-g0b56bed864-1","4.17.2+76-ge1f9cb16e2-1","4.17.2+76-ge1f9cb16e2-1~deb12u1","4.17.2-1","4.17.3+10-g091466ba55-1","4.17.3+10-g091466ba55-1.1","4.17.3+10-g091466ba55-1.1~exp1","4.17.3+10-g091466ba55-1.1~exp2","4.17.3+10-g091466ba55-1~deb12u1","4.17.3+36-g54dacb5c02-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31146.json"}},{"package":{"name":"xen","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xen?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.19.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31146.json"}},{"package":{"name":"xen","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xen?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.19.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31146.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-31146"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
