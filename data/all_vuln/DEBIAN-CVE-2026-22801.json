From 1.6.26 to 1.6.53, there is an integer truncation in the libpng simplified write API functions png_write_image_16bit and png_write_image_8bit causes heap buffer over-read when the caller provides a negative row stride (for bottom-up image layouts) or a stride exceeding 65535 bytes. The bug was introduced in libpng 1.6.26 (October 2016) by casts added to silence compiler warnings on 16-bit systems. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.6.54.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libpng1.6","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libpng1.6?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.6.37-3","1.6.37-3+deb11u1","1.6.37-4","1.6.37-5","1.6.38-1","1.6.38-2","1.6.39-1","1.6.39-2","1.6.40-1","1.6.40-2","1.6.40-3","1.6.41-1","1.6.42-1","1.6.42-1.1~exp1","1.6.43-1","1.6.43-1exp1","1.6.43-2","1.6.43-3","1.6.43-4","1.6.43-5","1.6.44-1","1.6.44-2","1.6.44-3","1.6.45-1","1.6.46-1","1.6.46-2","1.6.46-3","1.6.46-4","1.6.47-1","1.6.47-1.1","1.6.48-1","1.6.49-1~exp1","1.6.50-1","1.6.50-1~exp1","1.6.51-1","1.6.52-1","1.6.53-1","1.6.54-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22801.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libpng1.6","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libpng1.6?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.6.39-2","1.6.39-2+deb12u1","1.6.40-1","1.6.40-2","1.6.40-3","1.6.41-1","1.6.42-1","1.6.42-1.1~exp1","1.6.43-1","1.6.43-1exp1","1.6.43-2","1.6.43-3","1.6.43-4","1.6.43-5","1.6.44-1","1.6.44-2","1.6.44-3","1.6.45-1","1.6.46-1","1.6.46-2","1.6.46-3","1.6.46-4","1.6.47-1","1.6.47-1.1","1.6.48-1","1.6.49-1~exp1","1.6.50-1","1.6.50-1~exp1","1.6.51-1","1.6.52-1","1.6.53-1","1.6.54-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22801.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libpng1.6","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libpng1.6?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.6.48-1","1.6.48-1+deb13u1","1.6.49-1~exp1","1.6.50-1","1.6.50-1~exp1","1.6.51-1","1.6.52-1","1.6.53-1","1.6.54-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22801.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libpng1.6","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libpng1.6?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.6.54-1"}]}],"versions":["1.6.48-1","1.6.49-1~exp1","1.6.50-1","1.6.50-1~exp1","1.6.51-1","1.6.52-1","1.6.53-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22801.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2026-22801"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
