As the SSL_get_verify_result() function is not used the certificated is trusted always and it can not be ensured that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements. This could allow an attacker to use an invalid certificate to claim to be a trusted host, use expired certificates, or conduct other attacks that could be detected if the certificate is properly validated.
