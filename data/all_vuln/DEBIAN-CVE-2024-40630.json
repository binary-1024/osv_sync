{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-40630","published":"2024-07-15T20:15:05Z","modified":"2025-10-14T04:26:35.365507Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-40630"],"details":"OpenImageIO is a toolset for reading, writing, and manipulating image files of any image file format relevant to VFX / animation via a format-agnostic API with a feature set, scalability, and robustness needed for feature film production. In affected versions there is a bug in the heif input functionality of OpenImageIO. Specifically, in `HeifInput::seek_subimage()`.  In the worst case, this can lead to an information disclosure vulnerability, particularly for programs that directly use the `ImageInput` APIs. This bug has been addressed in commit `0a2dcb4c` which is included in the 2.5.13.1 release. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"openimageio","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openimageio?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.2.10.1+dfsg-1","2.2.10.1+dfsg-1+deb11u1","2.2.13.1+dfsg-1","2.2.14.0+dfsg-1","2.2.16.0+dfsg-1","2.2.17.0+dfsg-1","2.2.17.0+dfsg-2","2.2.18.0+dfsg-1","2.2.18.0+dfsg-2","2.3.11.0+dfsg-1","2.3.12.0+dfsg-1","2.3.14.0+dfsg-1","2.3.14.0+dfsg-2","2.3.14.0+dfsg-3","2.3.17.0+dfsg-1","2.3.18.0+dfsg-1","2.3.18.0+dfsg-2","2.3.18.0+dfsg-3","2.3.18.0+dfsg-4","2.3.18.0+dfsg-5","2.3.18.0+dfsg-6","2.3.21.0+dfsg-1","2.3.8.0+dfsg-1","2.3.9.1+dfsg-1","2.4.12.0+dfsg-1","2.4.13.0+dfsg-1","2.4.14.0+dfsg-1","2.4.16.0+dfsg-1","2.4.17.0+dfsg-1","2.4.17.0+dfsg-1.1","2.4.7.1+dfsg-1","2.4.7.1+dfsg-2","2.4.9.0+dfsg-1","2.5.10.1+dfsg-1","2.5.12.0+dfsg-1","2.5.12.0+dfsg-2","2.5.14.0+dfsg-1","2.5.15.0+dfsg-1","2.5.16.0+dfsg-1","2.5.18.0+dfsg-1","2.5.7.0+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-40630.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openimageio","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openimageio?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.12.0+dfsg-1","2.4.13.0+dfsg-1","2.4.14.0+dfsg-1","2.4.16.0+dfsg-1","2.4.17.0+dfsg-1","2.4.17.0+dfsg-1.1","2.4.7.1+dfsg-2","2.4.9.0+dfsg-1","2.5.10.1+dfsg-1","2.5.12.0+dfsg-1","2.5.12.0+dfsg-2","2.5.14.0+dfsg-1","2.5.15.0+dfsg-1","2.5.16.0+dfsg-1","2.5.18.0+dfsg-1","2.5.7.0+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-40630.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openimageio","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openimageio?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.5.14.0+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-40630.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openimageio","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openimageio?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.5.14.0+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-40630.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-40630"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
