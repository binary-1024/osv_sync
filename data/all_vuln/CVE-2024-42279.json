  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: microchip-core: ensure TX and RX FIFOs are empty at start of a transfer\n\nWhile transmitting with rx_len == 0, the RX FIFO is not going to be\nemptied in the interrupt handler. A subsequent transfer could then\nread crap from the previous transfer out of the RX FIFO into the\nstart RX buffer. The core provides a register that will empty the RX and\nTX FIFOs, so do that before each transfer.",
