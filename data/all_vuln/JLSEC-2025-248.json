This flaw involves an integer overflow that can be triggered when processing a Web Archive (WARC) file that claims to have more than INT64_MAX - 4 content bytes. An attacker could craft a malicious WARC archive to induce this overflow, potentially leading to unpredictable program behavior, memory corruption, or a denial-of-service condition within applications that process such archives using libarchive.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"LibArchive_jll","ecosystem":"Julia","purl":"pkg:julia/LibArchive_jll?uuid=1e303b3e-d4db-56ce-88c4-91e52606a1a8"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.8.0+0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/SecurityAdvisories.jl/tree/generated/osv/2025/JLSEC-2025-248.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-5916"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2370872"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/pull/2568"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/releases/tag/v3.8.0"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC-BY-4.0","sources":[{"html_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-5916","id":"CVE-2025-5916","imported":"2025-11-25T21:58:26.895Z","modified":"2025-08-15T18:12:06.987Z","published":"2025-06-09T20:15:27.170Z","url":"https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2025-5916"}]}}
