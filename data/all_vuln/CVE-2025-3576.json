If RC4 is preferred over stronger encryption types, an attacker could exploit MD5 collisions to forge message integrity codes. This may lead to unauthorized message tampering.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:11487"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:13664"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:13777"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:15000"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:15001"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:15002"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:15003"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:15004"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:8411"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:9418"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:9430"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2359465"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-3576"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.22/krb5-1.22.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/05/msg00047.html"}]}
