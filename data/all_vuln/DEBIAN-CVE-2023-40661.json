To take advantage of these flaws, an attacker must have physical access to the computer system and employ a custom-crafted USB device or smart card to manipulate responses to APDUs. This manipulation can potentially allow \r compromise key generation, certificate loading, and other card management operations during enrollment.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"opensc","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/opensc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.21.0-1+deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["0.21.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-40661.json"}},{"package":{"name":"opensc","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/opensc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.23.0-0.3+deb12u1"}]}],"versions":["0.23.0-0.3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-40661.json"}},{"package":{"name":"opensc","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/opensc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.23.0-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-40661.json"}},{"package":{"name":"opensc","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/opensc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.23.0-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-40661.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-40661"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
