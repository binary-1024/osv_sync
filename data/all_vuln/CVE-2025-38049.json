  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/resctrl: Fix allocation of cleanest CLOSID on platforms with no monitors\n\nCommit\n\n  6eac36bb9eb0 (\"x86/resctrl: Allocate the cleanest CLOSID by searching closid_num_dirty_rmid\")\n\nadded logic that causes resctrl to search for the CLOSID with the fewest dirty\ncache lines when creating a new control group, if requested by the arch code.\nThis depends on the values read from the llc_occupancy counters. The logic is\napplicable to architectures where the CLOSID effectively forms part of the\nmonitoring identifier and so do not allow complete freedom to choose an unused\nmonitoring identifier for a given CLOSID.\n\nThis support missed that some platforms may not have these counters.  This\ncauses a NULL pointer dereference when creating a new control group as the\narray was not allocated by dom_data_init().\n\nAs this feature isn't necessary on platforms that don't have cache occupancy\nmonitors, add this to the check that occurs when a new control group is\nallocated.",
