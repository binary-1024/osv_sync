  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfsd: allow SC_STATUS_FREEABLE when searching via nfs4_lookup_stateid()  The pynfs DELEG8 test fails when run against nfsd. It acquires a delegation and then lets the lease time out. It then tries to use the deleg stateid and expects to see NFS4ERR_DELEG_REVOKED, but it gets bad NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID instead.  When a delegation is revoked, it's initially marked with SC_STATUS_REVOKED, or SC_STATUS_ADMIN_REVOKED and later, it's marked with the SC_STATUS_FREEABLE flag, which denotes that it is waiting for s FREE_STATEID call.  nfs4_lookup_stateid() accepts a statusmask that includes the status flags that a found stateid is allowed to have. Currently, that mask never includes SC_STATUS_FREEABLE, which means that revoked delegations are (almost) never found.  Add SC_STATUS_FREEABLE to the always-allowed status flags, and remove it from nfsd4_delegreturn() since it's now always implied.",
