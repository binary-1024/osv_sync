It acquires a delegation and then lets the lease time out. It then tries to use the deleg stateid and expects to see NFS4ERR_DELEG_REVOKED, but it gets bad NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID instead.  When a delegation is revoked, it's initially marked with SC_STATUS_REVOKED, or SC_STATUS_ADMIN_REVOKED and later, it's marked with the SC_STATUS_FREEABLE flag, which denotes that it is waiting for s FREE_STATEID call.  nfs4_lookup_stateid() accepts a statusmask that includes the status flags that a found stateid is allowed to have. Currently, that mask never includes SC_STATUS_FREEABLE, which means that revoked delegations are (almost) never found.  Add SC_STATUS_FREEABLE to the always-allowed status flags, and remove it from nfsd4_delegreturn() since it's now always implied.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.25-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-39688.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.25-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-39688.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-39688"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
