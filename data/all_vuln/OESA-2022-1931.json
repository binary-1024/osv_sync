Mailman is integrated with the web, making it easy for users to manage their accounts and for list owners to administer their lists. Mailman supports built-in archiving, automatic bounce processing, content filtering, digest delivery, spam filters, and more.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nIn GNU Mailman before 2.1.36, the CSRF token for the Cgi/admindb.py admindb page contains an encrypted version of the list admin password. This could potentially be cracked by a moderator via an offline brute-force attack.(CVE-2021-43332)\r\n\r\nIn GNU Mailman before 2.1.36, a crafted URL to the Cgi/options.py user options page can execute arbitrary JavaScript for XSS.(CVE-2021-43331)\r\n\r\nIn GNU Mailman before 2.1.38, a list member or moderator can get a CSRF token and craft an admin request (using that token) to set a new admin password or make other changes.(CVE-2021-44227)",
