This could lead to local\ninformation disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed.\nUser interaction is needed for exploitation. (CVE-2020-0093)\n\nexif_entry_get_value in exif-entry.c in libexif 0.6.21 has a divide-by-zero\nerror (CVE-2020-12767).\n\nAn issue was discovered in libexif before 0.6.22. Several buffer over-reads in\nEXIF MakerNote handling could lead to information disclosure and crashes\n(CVE-2020-13112).\n\nAn issue was discovered in libexif before 0.6.22. Use of uninitialized memory\nin EXIF Makernote handling could lead to crashes and potential use-after-free\nconditions (CVE-2020-13113).\n\nAn issue was discovered in libexif before 0.6.22. An unrestricted size in\nhandling Canon EXIF MakerNote data could lead to consumption of large amounts\nof compute time for decoding EXIF data (CVE-2020-13114).\n\nThe libexif package has been updated to version 0.6.22, fixing these issues\nand other bugs.\n\nAlso, the exif package has been updated to version 0.6.22.
