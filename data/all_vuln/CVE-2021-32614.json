{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2021-32614","published":"2021-05-26T22:15:08Z","modified":"2025-08-09T19:01:28Z","details":"A flaw was found in dmg2img through 20170502. fill_mishblk() does not check the length of the read buffer, and copy 0xCC bytes from it. The length of the buffer is controlled by an attacker. By providing a length smaller than 0xCC, memcpy reaches out of the malloc'ed bound. This possibly leads to memory layout information leaking in the data. This might be used in a chain of vulnerability in order to reach code execution.","references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1959911"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"}]}
