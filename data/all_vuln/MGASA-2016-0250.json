A user connecting to a guest VM using spice could potentially use this\nflaw to crash the QEMU-KVM process or execute arbitrary code with the privileges\nof the host's QEMU-KVM process (CVE-2016-0749).\n\nA memory access flaw was found in the way spice handled certain guests using\ncrafted primary surface parameters. A user in a guest could use this flaw to\nread from and write to arbitrary memory locations on the host (CVE-2016-2150).\n",
