NOTE: it could be argued that because libxml2 already provides the ability to disable external entity expansion, the responsibility for resolving this issue lies with application developers; according to this argument, this entry should be REJECTed and each affected application would need its own CVE.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libxml2","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libxml2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.8.0+dfsg1-7+nmu1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2013-0339.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libxml2","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libxml2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.8.0+dfsg1-7+nmu1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2013-0339.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libxml2","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libxml2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.8.0+dfsg1-7+nmu1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2013-0339.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libxml2","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libxml2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.8.0+dfsg1-7+nmu1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2013-0339.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0339"}]}
