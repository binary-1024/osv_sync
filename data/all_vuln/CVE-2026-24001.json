{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-24001","published":"2026-01-22T02:23:44.059Z","modified":"2026-01-28T05:53:12.133059Z","aliases":["GHSA-73rr-hh4g-fpgx"],"related":["CGA-x283-fg8c-84gh"],"summary":"jsdiff has a Denial of Service vulnerability in parsePatch and applyPatch","details":"jsdiff is a JavaScript text differencing implementation. Prior to versions 8.0.3, 5.2.2, and 4.0.4, attempting to parse a patch whose filename headers contain the line break characters `\\r`, `\\u2028`, or `\\u2029` can cause the `parsePatch` method to enter an infinite loop. It then consumes memory without limit until the process crashes due to running out of memory. Applications are therefore likely to be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack if they call `parsePatch` with a user-provided patch as input. A large payload is not needed to trigger the vulnerability, so size limits on user input do not provide any protection. Furthermore, some applications may be vulnerable even when calling `parsePatch` on a patch generated by the application itself if the user is nonetheless able to control the filename headers (e.g. by directly providing the filenames of the files to be diffed). The `applyPatch` method is similarly affected if (and only if) called with a string representation of a patch as an argument, since under the hood it parses that string using `parsePatch`. Other methods of the library are unaffected. Finally, a second and lesser interdependent bug - a ReDOS - also exhibits when those same line break characters are present in a patch's *patch* header (also known as its \"leading garbage\"). A maliciously-crafted patch header of length *n* can take `parsePatch` O(*n*³) time to parse. Versions 8.0.3, 5.2.2, and 4.0.4 contain a fix. As a workaround, do not attempt to parse patches that contain any of these characters: `\\r`, `\\u2028`, or `\\u2029`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff","events":[{"introduced":"e80648d06dd3dd967622dc418bcad821b003ed4a"},{"fixed":"13576bfbcc444ce48f71cfd1e08529bd13962411"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"fixed":"8.0.3"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff","events":[{"introduced":"d358a573dc38fb89dd5ee296805e29f75c932a58"},{"fixed":"b7b6339dea15baa636bebe7092ec1cbabf001dea"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"5.0.0"},{"fixed":"5.2.2"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f06f3e4cacad5955caf891a8a02c5bb1c954bcb5"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.4"}]}}],"versions":["7.0.0","v6.0.0","v8.0.0","v8.0.1","v8.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24001.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24001.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/commit/15a1585230748c8ae6f8274c202e0c87309142f5"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/issues/653"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/649"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/security/advisories/GHSA-73rr-hh4g-fpgx"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24001"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-1333","CWE-400"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24001.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
