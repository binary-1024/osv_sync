{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2025-55130","published":"2026-01-20T21:16:03.177Z","modified":"2026-01-21T11:16:00.405981Z","details":"A flaw in Node.js’s Permissions model allows attackers to bypass `--allow-fs-read` and `--allow-fs-write` restrictions using crafted relative symlink paths. By chaining directories and symlinks, a script granted access only to the current directory can escape the allowed path and read sensitive files. This breaks the expected isolation guarantees and enables arbitrary file read/write, leading to potential system compromise.\nThis vulnerability affects users of the permission model on Node.js v20,  v22,  v24, and v25.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nodejs","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.23","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nodejs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"24.13.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["22.11.0-r0","22.11.0-r1","22.11.0-r2","22.13.1-r0","22.13.1-r1","22.13.1-r2","22.13.1-r3","22.13.1-r4","22.13.1-r5","22.16.0-r0","22.16.0-r1","22.16.0-r2","22.16.0-r3","22.19.0-r3","22.19.0-r4","22.21.0-r0","24.11.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-55130.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2025-55130"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
