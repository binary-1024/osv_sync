{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-24813","published":"2025-03-10T17:15:35Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:20:22.859707Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-24813"],"details":"Path Equivalence: 'file.Name' (Internal Dot) leading to Remote Code Execution and/or Information disclosure and/or malicious content added to uploaded files via write enabled Default Servlet in Apache Tomcat.  This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.2, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.34, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.98. The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are  known to be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions  may also be affected.   If all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to view       security sensitive files and/or inject content into those files: - writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default) - support for partial PUT (enabled by default) - a target URL for security sensitive uploads that was a sub-directory of a target URL for public uploads - attacker knowledge of the names of security sensitive files being uploaded - the security sensitive files also being uploaded via partial PUT  If all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to       perform remote code execution: - writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default) - support for partial PUT (enabled by default) - application was using Tomcat's file based session persistence with the default storage location - application included a library that may be leveraged in a deserialization attack  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.3, 10.1.35 or 9.0.99, which fixes the issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"tomcat10","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/tomcat10?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"10.1.34-0+deb12u2"}]}],"versions":["10.1.10-1","10.1.13-1","10.1.14-1","10.1.15-1","10.1.16-1","10.1.20-1","10.1.23-1","10.1.25-1","10.1.25-1~bpo12+1","10.1.25-2","10.1.30-1","10.1.30-1~bpo12+1","10.1.31-1","10.1.33-1","10.1.33-1~bpo12+1","10.1.34-0+deb12u1","10.1.6-1","10.1.6-1+deb12u1","10.1.6-1+deb12u2","10.1.7-1","10.1.8-1","10.1.9-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-24813.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tomcat10","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/tomcat10?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"10.1.35-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-24813.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tomcat10","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/tomcat10?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"10.1.35-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-24813.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tomcat9","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/tomcat9?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.0.43-2~deb11u12"}]}],"versions":["9.0.43-1","9.0.43-2~deb11u1","9.0.43-2~deb11u10","9.0.43-2~deb11u11","9.0.43-2~deb11u2","9.0.43-2~deb11u3","9.0.43-2~deb11u4","9.0.43-2~deb11u5","9.0.43-2~deb11u6","9.0.43-2~deb11u7","9.0.43-2~deb11u8","9.0.43-2~deb11u9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-24813.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tomcat9","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/tomcat9?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.0.70-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-24813.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tomcat9","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/tomcat9?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.0.70-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-24813.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tomcat9","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/tomcat9?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.0.70-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-24813.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-24813"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
