This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.2, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.34, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.98. The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are  known to be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions  may also be affected.   If all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to view       security sensitive files and/or inject content into those files: -\u00a0writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default) - support for partial PUT (enabled by default) - a target URL for security sensitive uploads that was a sub-directory of\u00a0a target URL for public uploads -\u00a0attacker knowledge of the names of security sensitive files being\u00a0uploaded -\u00a0the security sensitive files also being uploaded via partial PUT  If all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to       perform remote code execution: - writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default) -\u00a0support for partial PUT (enabled by default) -\u00a0application was using Tomcat's file based session persistence with the\u00a0default storage location -\u00a0application included a library that may be leveraged in a\u00a0deserialization attack  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.3, 10.1.35 or 9.0.99, which fixes the issue.",
