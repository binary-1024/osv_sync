It supports dozens of protocol capture file formats and understands more than a thousand protocols.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in Wireshark up to 4.2.8/4.4.1 (Packet Analyzer Software).Using CWE to declare the problem leads to CWE-126. The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.Impacted is availability.Upgrading to version 4.2.9 or 4.4.2 eliminates this vulnerability.(CVE-2024-11596)\n\nColumn handling crashes in Wireshark 4.4.0 to 4.4.6 and 4.2.0 to 4.2.12 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file(CVE-2025-5601)",
