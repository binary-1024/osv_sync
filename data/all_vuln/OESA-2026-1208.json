The GIMP offers many tools and filters, and provides a large image manipulation toolbox, including channel operations and layers, effects, subpixel imaging and antialiasing, and conversions, together with multilevel undo. The GIMP offers a scripting facility, but many of the included scripts rely on fonts that we cannot distribute.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nGIMP PNM File Parsing Integer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of GIMP. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of PNM files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-28273.(CVE-2025-14422)\n\nGIMP JP2 File Parsing Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of GIMP. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of JP2 files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-28248.(CVE-2025-14425)\n\nA flaw was found in GIMP. An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the GIMP &quot;Despeckle&quot;  plug-in. The issue occurs due to unchecked multiplication of image dimensions, such as width, height, and bytes-per-pixel (img_bpp), which can result in allocating insufficient memory and subsequently performing out-of-bounds writes. This issue could lead to heap corruption, a potential denial of service (DoS), or arbitrary code execution in certain scenarios.(CVE-2025-6035)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gimp","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/gimp&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.10.6-17.oe2003sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["gimp-2.10.6-17.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","gimp-debuginfo-2.10.6-17.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","gimp-debugsource-2.10.6-17.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","gimp-devel-2.10.6-17.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","gimp-help-2.10.6-17.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","gimp-libs-2.10.6-17.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["gimp-2.10.6-17.oe2003sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["gimp-2.10.6-17.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","gimp-debuginfo-2.10.6-17.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","gimp-debugsource-2.10.6-17.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","gimp-devel-2.10.6-17.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","gimp-help-2.10.6-17.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","gimp-libs-2.10.6-17.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2026-1208.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2026-1208"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-14422"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-14425"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-6035"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
