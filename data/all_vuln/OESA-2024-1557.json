  "details": "Xwayland is an X server for running X clients under Wayland.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in xorg-server. A specially crafted request to RRChangeProviderProperty or RRChangeOutputProperty can trigger an integer overflow which may lead to a disclosure of sensitive information.(CVE-2023-6478)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in X.Org server. Both DeviceFocusEvent and the XIQueryPointer reply contain a bit for each logical button currently down. Buttons can be arbitrarily mapped to any value up to 255, but the X.Org Server was only allocating space for the device&apos;s particular number of buttons, leading to a heap overflow if a bigger value was used.(CVE-2023-6816)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the X.Org server. The GLX PBuffer code does not call the XACE hook when creating the buffer, leaving it unlabeled. When the client issues another request to access that resource (as with a GetGeometry) or when it creates another resource that needs to access that buffer, such as a GC, the XSELINUX code will try to use an object that was never labeled and crash because the SID is NULL.(CVE-2024-0408)\r\n\r\nA heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability was found in the X.org server&apos;s ProcXIGetSelectedEvents() function. This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker&apos;s inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads.(CVE-2024-31080)\r\n\r\nA heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability was found in the X.org server&apos;s ProcXIPassiveGrabDevice() function.
