{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-40186","published":"2025-11-12T22:15:45Z","modified":"2025-11-15T13:10:21.515910Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-40186"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tcp: Don't call reqsk_fastopen_remove() in tcp_conn_request().  syzbot reported the splat below in tcp_conn_request(). [0]  If a listener is close()d while a TFO socket is being processed in tcp_conn_request(), inet_csk_reqsk_queue_add() does not set reqsk->sk and calls inet_child_forget(), which calls tcp_disconnect() for the TFO socket.  After the cited commit, tcp_disconnect() calls reqsk_fastopen_remove(), where reqsk_put() is called due to !reqsk->sk.  Then, reqsk_fastopen_remove() in tcp_conn_request() decrements the last req->rsk_refcnt and frees reqsk, and __reqsk_free() at the drop_and_free label causes the refcount underflow for the listener and double-free of the reqsk.  Let's remove reqsk_fastopen_remove() in tcp_conn_request().  Note that other callers make sure tp->fastopen_rsk is not NULL.  [0]: refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.
