  "details": "BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom. In versions prior to 3.0.13, the \"Shared Notes\" feature contains a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability with the input location being the \"Username\" field and the output location on the \"Shared Notes\" page, when a user with a malicious username is editing content. This vulnerability allows a low-privileged user to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of higher-privileged users (e.g., Admins) who open the Shared Notes page. Version 3.0.13 fixes the issue.",
