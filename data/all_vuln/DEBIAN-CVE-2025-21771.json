  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched_ext: Fix incorrect autogroup migration detection  scx_move_task() is called from sched_move_task() and tells the BPF scheduler that cgroup migration is being committed. sched_move_task() is used by both cgroup and autogroup migrations and scx_move_task() tried to filter out autogroup migrations by testing the destination cgroup and PF_EXITING but this is not enough. In fact, without explicitly tagging the thread which is doing the cgroup migration, there is no good way to tell apart scx_move_task() invocations for racing migration to the root cgroup and an autogroup migration.  This led to scx_move_task() incorrectly ignoring a migration from non-root cgroup to an autogroup of the root cgroup triggering the following warning:    WARNING: CPU: 7 PID: 1 at kernel/sched/ext.c:3725 scx_cgroup_can_attach+0x196/0x340   ...
