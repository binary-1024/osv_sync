NOTE: the vendor advisory claims that only a DoS is possible, but the original researcher is reliable.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"asterisk","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/asterisk?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:1.2.10.dfsg-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2006-2898.json"}},{"package":{"name":"iaxmodem","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/iaxmodem?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.1.8.dfsg-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2006-2898.json"}},{"package":{"name":"iaxmodem","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/iaxmodem?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.1.8.dfsg-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2006-2898.json"}},{"package":{"name":"iaxmodem","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/iaxmodem?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.1.8.dfsg-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2006-2898.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2898"}]}
