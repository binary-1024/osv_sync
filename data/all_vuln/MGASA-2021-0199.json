  "details": "More internal network hosts could have been probed by a malicious webpage:\nFurther techniques that built on the slipstream research combined with a\nmalicious webpage could have exposed both an internal network's hosts as well\nas services running on the user's local machine (CVE-2021-23961).\n\nOut of bound write due to lazy initialization:\nA WebGL framebuffer was not initialized early enough, resulting in memory\ncorruption and an out of bound write (CVE-2021-23994).\n\nUse-after-free in Responsive Design Mode:\nWhen Responsive Design Mode was enabled, it used references to objects that\nwere previously freed. We presume that with enough effort this could have been\nexploited to run arbitrary code (CVE-2021-23995).\n\nSecure Lock icon could have been spoofed:\nThrough complicated navigations with new windows, an HTTP page could have\ninherited a secure lock icon from an HTTPS page (CVE-2021-23998).\n\nBlob URLs may have been granted additional privileges:\nIf a Blob URL was loaded through some unusual user interaction, it could have\nbeen loaded by the System Principal and granted additional privileges that\nshould not be granted to web content (CVE-2021-23999).\n\nArbitrary FTP command execution on FTP servers using an encoded URL:\nWhen a user clicked on an FTP URL containing encoded newline characters\n(%0A and %0D), the newlines would have been interpreted as such and allowed\narbitrary commands to be sent to the FTP server (CVE-2021-24002).\n\nIncorrect size computation in WebAssembly JIT could lead to null-reads:\nThe WebAssembly JIT could miscalculate the size of a return type, which could\nlead to a null read and result in a crash.\nNote: This issue only affected x86-32 platforms. Other platforms are unaffected.\n(CVE-2021-29945).\n\nPort blocking could be bypassed:\nPorts that were written as an integer overflow above the bounds of a 16-bit\ninteger could have bypassed port blocking restrictions when used in the\nAlt-Svc header (CVE-2021-29946).\n",
