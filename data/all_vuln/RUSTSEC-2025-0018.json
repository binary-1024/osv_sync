As a result, a malformed ELF file could trigger out-of-bounds reads in\na consumer of the HashTable API by setting these fields to inappropriately large\nvalues that would fall outside the relevant hash table section, and by\nintroducing correspondingly out-of-bounds hash table indexes elsewhere in the ELF\nfile.",
