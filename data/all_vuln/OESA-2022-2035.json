  "details": "The Linux Kernel, the operating system core itself.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\ndrivers/scsi/stex.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.9 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory because stex_queuecommand_lck lacks a memset for the PASSTHRU_CMD case.(CVE-2022-40768)\r\n\r\nA vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function nilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level of the file fs/nilfs2/inode.c of the component nilfs2. The manipulation leads to null pointer dereference. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211920.(CVE-2022-3621)\r\n\r\nA vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Linux Kernel. Affected by this issue is the function tst_timer of the file drivers/atm/idt77252.c of the component IPsec. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211934 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.(CVE-2022-3635)\r\n\r\ndrivers/usb/mon/mon_bin.c in usbmon in the Linux kernel before 5.19.15 and 6.x before 6.0.1 allows a user-space client to corrupt the monitor&apos;s internal memory.(CVE-2022-43750)\n\nA vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function vsock_connect of the file net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c of the component IPsec. The manipulation leads to memory leak. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211930 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.(CVE-2022-3629)\n\nA vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in Linux Kernel. This issue affects the function nilfs_attach_log_writer of the file fs/nilfs2/segment.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to memory leak. The attack may be initiated remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211961 was assigned to this vulnerability.(CVE-2022-3646)\n\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel\u2019s networking code. A use-after-free was found in the way the sch_sfb enqueue function used the socket buffer (SKB) cb field after the same SKB had been enqueued (and freed) into a child qdisc. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to crash the system, causing a denial of service.(CVE-2022-3586)",
