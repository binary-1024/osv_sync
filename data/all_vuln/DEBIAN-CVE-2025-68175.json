This can lead to situations where any release call (like from a simple \"v4l2-ctl -l\") may release a currently streaming queue when called on such a device.  This is reproducible on an i.MX8MP board by streaming from an ISI capture device using gstreamer:  \tgst-launch-1.0 -v v4l2src device=/dev/videoX ! \\ \t    video/x-raw,format=GRAY8,width=1280,height=800,framerate=1/120 ! \\ \t    fakesink  While this stream is running, querying the caps of the same device provokes the error state:  \tv4l2-ctl -l -d /dev/videoX  This results in the following trace:  [  155.452152] ------------[ cut here ]------------ [  155.452163] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1708 at drivers/media/platform/nxp/imx8-isi/imx8-isi-pipe.c:713 mxc_isi_pipe_irq_handler+0x19c/0x1b0 [imx8_isi] [  157.004248] Modules linked in: cfg80211 rpmsg_ctrl rpmsg_char rpmsg_tty virtio_rpmsg_bus rpmsg_ns rpmsg_core rfkill nft_ct nf_conntrack nf_defrag_ipv6 nf_defrag_ipv4 nf_tables mcp251x6 [  157.053499] CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 1708 Comm: python3 Not tainted 6.15.4-00114-g1f61ca5cad76 #1 PREEMPT [  157.064369] Hardware name: imx8mp_board_01 (DT) [  157.068205] pstate: 400000c5 (nZcv daIF -PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--) [  157.075169] pc : mxc_isi_pipe_irq_handler+0x19c/0x1b0 [imx8_isi] [  157.081195] lr : mxc_isi_pipe_irq_handler+0x38/0x1b0 [imx8_isi] [  157.087126] sp : ffff800080003ee0 [  157.090438] x29: ffff800080003ee0 x28: ffff0000c3688000 x27: 0000000000000000 [  157.097580] x26: 0000000000000000 x25: ffff0000c1e7ac00 x24: ffff800081b5ad50 [  157.104723] x23: 00000000000000d1 x22: 0000000000000000 x21: ffff0000c25e4000 [  157.111866] x20: 0000000060000200 x19: ffff80007a0608d0 x18: 0000000000000000 [  157.119008] x17: ffff80006a4e3000 x16: ffff800080000000 x15: 0000000000000000 [  157.126146] x14: 0000000000000000 x13: 0000000000000000 x12: 0000000000000000 [  157.133287] x11: 0000000000000040 x10: ffff0000c01445f0 x9 : ffff80007a053a38 [  157.140425] x8 : ffff0000c04004b8 x7 : 0000000000000000 x6 : 0000000000000000 [  157.147567] x5 : ffff0000c0400490 x4 : ffff80006a4e3000 x3 : ffff0000c25e4000 [  157.154706] x2 : 0000000000000000 x1 : ffff8000825c0014 x0 : 0000000060000200 [  157.161850] Call trace: [  157.164296]  mxc_isi_pipe_irq_handler+0x19c/0x1b0 [imx8_isi] (P) [  157.170319]  __handle_irq_event_percpu+0x58/0x218 [  157.175029]  handle_irq_event+0x54/0xb8 [  157.178867]  handle_fasteoi_irq+0xac/0x248 [  157.182968]  handle_irq_desc+0x48/0x68 [  157.186723]  generic_handle_domain_irq+0x24/0x38 [  157.191346]  gic_handle_irq+0x54/0x120 [  157.195098]  call_on_irq_stack+0x24/0x30 [  157.199027]  do_interrupt_handler+0x88/0x98 [  157.203212]  el0_interrupt+0x44/0xc0 [  157.206792]  __el0_irq_handler_common+0x18/0x28 [  157.211328]  el0t_64_irq_handler+0x10/0x20 [  157.215429]  el0t_64_irq+0x198/0x1a0 [  157.219009] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---  Address this issue by moving the streaming preparation and cleanup to the vb2 .prepare_streaming() and .unprepare_streaming() operations. This also simplifies the driver by allowing direct usage of the vb2_ioctl_streamon() and vb2_ioctl_streamoff() helpers, and removal of the manual cleanup from mxc_isi_video_release().","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.57-1","6.12.57-1~bpo12+1","6.12.63-1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.10-1","6.16.11-1","6.16.12-1","6.16.12-1~bpo13+1","6.16.12-2","6.16.3-1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16.5-1","6.16.6-1","6.16.7-1","6.16.8-1","6.16.9-1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1","6.17.10-1","6.17.11-1","6.17.12-1","6.17.13-1","6.17.13-1~bpo13+1","6.17.2-1~exp1","6.17.5-1~exp1","6.17.6-1","6.17.7-1","6.17.7-2","6.17.8-1","6.17.8-1~bpo13+1","6.17.9-1","6.18.1-1~exp1","6.18.2-1~exp1","6.18~rc4-1~exp1","6.18~rc4-1~exp2","6.18~rc5-1~exp1","6.18~rc6-1~exp1","6.18~rc7-1~exp1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68175.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.17.8-1"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.57-1","6.12.57-1~bpo12+1","6.12.63-1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.10-1","6.16.11-1","6.16.12-1","6.16.12-1~bpo13+1","6.16.12-2","6.16.3-1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16.5-1","6.16.6-1","6.16.7-1","6.16.8-1","6.16.9-1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1","6.17.2-1~exp1","6.17.5-1~exp1","6.17.6-1","6.17.7-1","6.17.7-2","6.17.8-1~bpo13+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68175.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-68175"}]}
