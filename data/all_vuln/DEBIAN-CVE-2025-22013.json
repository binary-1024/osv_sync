This has been seen to   result in QEMU crashes where SVE is used by memmove(), as reported by   Eric Auger:    https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-68997  * Host SVE state is discarded *after* modification by ptrace, which was an   unintentional ptrace ABI change introduced with lazy discarding of SVE state.  * The host FPMR value can be discarded when running a non-protected VM,   where FPMR support is not exposed to a VM, and that VM uses   FPSIMD/SVE. In these cases the hyp code does not save the host's FPMR   before unbinding the host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME state, leaving a stale   value in memory.  Avoid these by eagerly saving and \"flushing\" the host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME state when loading a vCPU such that KVM does not need to save any of the host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME state. For clarity, fpsimd_kvm_prepare() is removed and the necessary call to fpsimd_save_and_flush_cpu_state() is placed in kvm_arch_vcpu_load_fp(). As 'fpsimd_state' and 'fpmr_ptr' should not be used, they are set to NULL; all uses of these will be removed in subsequent patches.  Historical problems go back at least as far as v5.17, e.g. erroneous assumptions about TIF_SVE being clear in commit:    8383741ab2e773a9 (\"KVM: arm64: Get rid of host SVE tracking/saving\")  ... and so this eager save+flush probably needs to be backported to ALL stable trees.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.21-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-22013.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.21-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-22013.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-22013"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
