The umask() call inside archive_write_disk_posix.c changes the umask of the whole process for a very short period of time; a race condition with another thread can lead to a permanent umask 0 setting. Such a race condition could lead to implicit directory creation with permissions 0777 (without the sticky bit), which means that any low-privileged local user can delete and rename files inside those directories.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"LibArchive_jll","ecosystem":"Julia","purl":"pkg:julia/LibArchive_jll?uuid=1e303b3e-d4db-56ce-88c4-91e52606a1a8"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.4+0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/SecurityAdvisories.jl/tree/generated/osv/2025/JLSEC-2025-238.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/issues/1876"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://groups.google.com/g/libarchive-announce"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC-BY-4.0","sources":[{"html_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30571","id":"CVE-2023-30571","imported":"2025-11-25T21:58:26.864Z","modified":"2025-01-14T17:15:11.673Z","published":"2023-05-29T20:15:09.513Z","url":"https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2023-30571"}]}}
