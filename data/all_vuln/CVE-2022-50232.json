  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: set UXN on swapper page tables\n\n[ This issue was fixed upstream by accident in c3cee924bd85 (\"arm64:\n  head: cover entire kernel image in initial ID map\") as part of a\n  large refactoring of the arm64 boot flow. This simple fix is therefore\n  preferred for -stable backporting ]\n\nOn a system that implements FEAT_EPAN, read/write access to the idmap\nis denied because UXN is not set on the swapper PTEs. As a result,\nidmap_kpti_install_ng_mappings panics the kernel when accessing\n__idmap_kpti_flag. Fix it by setting UXN on these PTEs.",
