From version 1.6.0 to before 1.6.51, a heap buffer over-read vulnerability exists in libpng's png_write_image_8bit function when processing 8-bit images through the simplified write API with convert_to_8bit enabled. The vulnerability affects 8-bit grayscale+alpha, RGB/RGBA, and images with incomplete row data. A conditional guard incorrectly allows 8-bit input to enter code expecting 16-bit input, causing reads up to 2 bytes beyond allocated buffer boundaries. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.51.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng","events":[{"introduced":"c53778ff53a73ad2d676602f5dc7019566be5058"},{"fixed":"49363adcfaf098748d7a4c8c624ad8c45a8c3a86"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.6.0"},{"fixed":"1.6.51"}]}}],"versions":["libpng-1.6.10-signed","libpng-1.6.11-signed","libpng-1.6.12-signed","libpng-1.6.13-signed","libpng-1.6.14-signed","libpng-1.6.15-master-signed","libpng-1.6.15-signed","libpng-1.6.16-master-signed","libpng-1.6.16-signed","libpng-1.6.17-master-signed","libpng-1.6.17-signed","libpng-1.6.18-master-signed","libpng-1.6.18-signed","libpng-1.6.2-signed","libpng-1.6.20-master-signed","libpng-1.6.20-signed","libpng-1.6.21-master-signed","libpng-1.6.21-signed","libpng-1.6.23-signed","libpng-1.6.24-master-signed","libpng-1.6.24-signed","libpng-1.6.25-master-signed","libpng-1.6.25-signed","libpng-1.6.26-master-signed","libpng-1.6.26-signed","libpng-1.6.28-signed","libpng-1.6.29-master-signed","libpng-1.6.29-signed","libpng-1.6.3-signed","libpng-1.6.30-master-signed","libpng-1.6.30-signed","libpng-1.6.31-master-signed","libpng-1.6.31-signed","libpng-1.6.4-signed","libpng-1.6.7-signed","libpng-1.6.8-signed","libpng-1.6.9-signed","v1.2.10","v1.2.10rc2","v1.2.10rc3","v1.2.11","v1.2.11beta1","v1.2.11beta2","v1.2.11beta2cos","v1.2.11beta3","v1.2.11beta4","v1.2.11rc1","v1.2.11rc2","v1.2.11rc3","v1.2.11rc5","v1.2.12","v1.2.13","v1.2.13beta1","v1.2.13rc1","v1.2.13rc2","v1.2.14","v1.2.14beta1","v1.2.14beta2","v1.2.14rc1","v1.2.15","v1.2.15beta1","v1.2.15beta2","v1.2.15beta3","v1.2.15beta4","v1.2.15beta5","v1.2.15beta6","v1.2.15rc1","v1.2.15rc2","v1.2.15rc3","v1.2.15rc4","v1.2.15rc5","v1.2.16","v1.2.16beta1","v1.2.16beta2","v1.2.16rc1","v1.2.17","v1.2.17beta1","v1.2.17beta2","v1.2.17rc1","v1.2.17rc2","v1.2.17rc3","v1.2.17rc4","v1.2.18","v1.2.19","v1.2.19beta1","v1.2.19beta10","v1.2.19beta11","v1.2.19beta12","v1.2.19beta13","v1.2.19beta14","v1.2.19beta15","v1.2.19beta16","v1.2.19beta17","v1.2.19beta18","v1.2.19beta19","v1.2.19beta2","v1.2.19beta20","v1.2.19beta21","v1.2.19beta22","v1.2.19beta23","v1.2.19beta24","v1.2.19beta25","v1.2.19beta26","v1.2.19beta27","v1.2.19beta28","v1.2.19beta29","v1.2.19beta3","v1.2.19beta30","v1.2.19beta31","v1.2.19beta4","v1.2.19beta5","v1.2.19beta6","v1.2.19beta7","v1.2.19beta8","v1.2.19beta9","v1.2.19rc1","v1.2.19rc2","v1.2.19rc3","v1.2.19rc4","v1.2.19rc5","v1.2.19rc6","v1.2.20","v1.2.20beta01","v1.2.20beta02","v1.2.20beta03","v1.2.20beta04","v1.2.20rc1","v1.2.20rc2","v1.2.20rc3","v1.2.20rc4","v1.2.20rc5","v1.2.20rc6","v1.2.21","v1.2.21beta1","v1.2.21beta2","v1.2.21rc1","v1.2.21rc2","v1.2.21rc3","v1.2.22","v1.2.22beta1","v1.2.22beta2","v1.2.22beta3","v1.2.22beta4","v1.2.22rc1","v1.2.23","v1.2.23beta01","v1.2.23beta02","v1.2.23beta03","v1.2.23beta04","v1.2.23beta05","v1.2.23rc01","v1.2.24","v1.2.24beta01","v1.2.24beta02","v1.2.24rc01","v1.2.25","v1.2.25beta01","v1.2.25beta02","v1.2.25beta03","v1.2.25beta04","v1.2.25beta05","v1.2.25beta06","v1.2.25rc01","v1.2.25rc02","v1.2.26","v1.2.26beta01","v1.2.26beta02","v1.2.26beta03","v1.2.26beta04","v1.2.26beta05","v1.2.26beta06","v1.2.26rc01","v1.2.27","v1.2.27beta01","v1.2.27beta02","v1.2.27beta03","v1.2.27beta04","v1.2.27beta05","v1.2.27beta06","v1.2.27rc01","v1.2.28","v1.2.29","v1.2.29beta01","v1.2.29beta02","v1.2.29beta03","v1.2.29rc01","v1.2.30","v1.2.30beta01","v1.2.30beta02","v1.2.30beta03","v1.2.30beta04","v1.2.30rc01","v1.2.30rc02","v1.2.30rc03","v1.2.30rc04","v1.2.30rc05","v1.2.30rc06","v1.2.30rc07","v1.2.30rc08","v1.2.31","v1.2.31rc01","v1.2.31rc02","v1.2.31rc03","v1.2.32","v1.2.32beta01","v1.2.32rc01","v1.2.33","v1.2.33beta01","v1.2.33rc01","v1.2.33rc02","v1.2.34","v1.2.34beta01","v1.2.34beta02","v1.2.34beta03","v1.2.34beta04","v1.2.34beta05","v1.2.34beta06","v1.2.34beta07","v1.2.34rc01","v1.2.35","v1.2.35beta01","v1.2.35beta02","v1.2.35beta03","v1.2.35rc01","v1.2.35rc02","v1.2.36","v1.2.36beta01","v1.2.36beta02","v1.2.36beta03","v1.2.36beta04","v1.2.36beta05","v1.2.37","v1.2.37beta01","v1.2.37beta02","v1.2.37beta03","v1.2.37rc01","v1.2.38","v1.2.38beta01","v1.2.38rc01","v1.2.38rc02","v1.2.38rc03","v1.2.39","v1.2.39beta01","v1.2.39beta02","v1.2.39beta03","v1.2.39beta04","v1.2.39beta05","v1.2.39rc01","v1.2.40","v1.2.40beta01","v1.2.40rc01","v1.2.41","v1.2.41beta01","v1.2.41beta02","v1.2.41beta03","v1.2.41beta04","v1.2.41beta05","v1.2.41beta06","v1.2.41beta07","v1.2.41beta08","v1.2.41beta09","v1.2.41beta10","v1.2.41beta11","v1.2.41beta12","v1.2.41beta13","v1.2.41beta14","v1.2.41beta15","v1.2.41beta16","v1.2.41beta17","v1.2.41beta18","v1.2.41beta19","v1.2.41rc01","v1.2.41rc02","v1.2.41rc03","v1.2.42","v1.2.42beta01","v1.2.42beta02","v1.2.42rc01","v1.2.42rc02","v1.2.42rc03","v1.2.42rc04","v1.2.42rc05","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.1beta01","v1.4.1beta02","v1.4.1beta03","v1.4.1beta04","v1.4.1beta05","v1.4.1beta06","v1.4.1beta07","v1.4.1beta08","v1.4.1beta09","v1.4.1beta10","v1.4.1beta11","v1.4.1beta12","v1.4.1rc01","v1.4.1rc02","v1.4.1rc03","v1.4.1rc04","v1.4.2
