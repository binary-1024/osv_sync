Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"dask.distributed","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/dask.distributed@1.20.2+ds.1-2?arch=source&distro=bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.18.0+ds.1-1","1.20.2+ds.1-1","1.20.2+ds.1-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"python3-distributed","binary_version":"1.20.2+ds.1-2"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2021/UBUNTU-CVE-2021-42343.json"}},{"package":{"name":"dask.distributed","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:20.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/dask.distributed@1.25.0+ds.1-1?arch=source&distro=focal"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.25.0+ds.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"python3-distributed","binary_version":"1.25.0+ds.1-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2021/UBUNTU-CVE-2021-42343.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-42343"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-42343"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
