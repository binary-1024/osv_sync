This is a result of a calculation done with 32-bit precision, which may overflow. It would then only be the overflowed (and hence small) number which gets compared against the established upper bound.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-07"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5017"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-385.txt"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/I7ZGWVVRI4XY2XSTBI3XEMWBXPDVX6OT/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PXUI4VMD52CH3T7YXAG3J2JW7ZNN3SXF/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
