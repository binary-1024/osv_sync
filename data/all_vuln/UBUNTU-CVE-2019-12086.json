When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint, the service has the mysql-connector-java jar (8.0.14 or earlier) in the classpath, and an attacker can host a crafted MySQL server reachable by the victim, an attacker can send a crafted JSON message that allows them to read arbitrary local files on the server. This occurs because of missing com.mysql.cj.jdbc.admin.MiniAdmin validation.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"jackson-databind","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:Pro:14.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/jackson-databind@2.2.2-1ubuntu0.1~esm1?arch=source&distro=esm-infra-legacy/trusty"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.2.2-1","2.2.2-1ubuntu0.1~esm1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"libjackson2-databind-java","binary_version":"2.2.2-1ubuntu0.1~esm1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2019/UBUNTU-CVE-2019-12086.json"}},{"package":{"name":"jackson-databind","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:Pro:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/jackson-databind@2.4.2-3ubuntu0.1~esm2?arch=source&distro=esm-apps/xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.2-3ubuntu0.1~esm2"}]}],"versions":["2.4.2-2","2.4.2-3","2.4.2-3ubuntu0.1~esm1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"Available with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro","binaries":[{"binary_name":"libjackson2-databind-java","binary_version":"2.4.2-3ubuntu0.1~esm2"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2019/UBUNTU-CVE-2019-12086.json"}},{"package":{"name":"jackson-databind","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/jackson-databind@2.9.8-1~18.04?arch=source&distro=bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.8.6-1","2.9.1-1","2.9.4-1","2.9.5-1","2.9.8-1~18.04"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"libjackson2-databind-java","binary_version":"2.9.8-1~18.04"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2019/UBUNTU-CVE-2019-12086.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-12086"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"http://russiansecurity.expert/2016/04/20/mysql-connect-file-read/"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2326"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.9.9"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4813-1"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-12086"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
