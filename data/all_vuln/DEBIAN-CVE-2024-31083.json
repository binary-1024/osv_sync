{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31083","published":"2024-04-05T12:15:37Z","modified":"2025-10-14T04:25:47.098078Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-31083"],"details":"A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the ProcRenderAddGlyphs() function of Xorg servers. This issue occurs when AllocateGlyph() is called to store new glyphs sent by the client to the X server, potentially resulting in multiple entries pointing to the same non-refcounted glyphs. Consequently, ProcRenderAddGlyphs() may free a glyph, leading to a use-after-free scenario when the same glyph pointer is subsequently accessed. This flaw allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system by sending a specially crafted request.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"xorg-server","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xorg-server?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2:1.20.11-1+deb11u13"}]}],"versions":["2:1.20.11-1","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u1","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u10","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u11","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u12","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u2","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u3","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u4","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u5","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u6","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u7","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u8","2:1.20.11-1+deb11u9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31083.json"}},{"package":{"name":"xorg-server","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xorg-server?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2:21.1.7-3+deb12u7"}]}],"versions":["2:21.1.7-3","2:21.1.7-3+deb12u1","2:21.1.7-3+deb12u2","2:21.1.7-3+deb12u3","2:21.1.7-3+deb12u4","2:21.1.7-3+deb12u5","2:21.1.7-3+deb12u6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31083.json"}},{"package":{"name":"xorg-server","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xorg-server?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2:21.1.11-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31083.json"}},{"package":{"name":"xorg-server","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xorg-server?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2:21.1.11-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31083.json"}},{"package":{"name":"xwayland","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xwayland?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2:22.1.9-1","2:23.1.0-1","2:23.1.1-1","2:23.2.0-1","2:23.2.1-1","2:23.2.2-1","2:23.2.3-1","2:23.2.4-1","2:23.2.6-1","2:24.0.99.901-1","2:24.1.0-1","2:24.1.2-1","2:24.1.3-1","2:24.1.4-1","2:24.1.4-2","2:24.1.4-3","2:24.1.5-1","2:24.1.6-1","2:24.1.8-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31083.json"}},{"package":{"name":"xwayland","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xwayland?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2:23.2.6-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31083.json"}},{"package":{"name":"xwayland","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/xwayland?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2:23.2.6-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31083.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-31083"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
