There is a variable \"dbentry->n_key_data\" in kadmin/dbutil/dump.c that can store 16-bit data but unknowingly the developer has assigned a \"u4\" variable to it, which is for 32-bit data. An attacker can use this vulnerability to affect other artifacts of the database as we know that a Kerberos database dump file contains trusted data.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"krb5","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/krb5?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.15.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.11-r0","1.11-r1","1.11-r2","1.11.2-r0","1.11.2-r1","1.11.2-r2","1.11.3-r0","1.11.4-r0","1.12.1-r0","1.12.2-r0","1.13-r0","1.13-r1","1.13.1-r0","1.13.1-r1","1.13.2-r0","1.13.2-r1","1.13.2-r2","1.14-r0","1.14-r1","1.14-r2","1.14.3-r0","1.14.3-r1","1.14.3-r2","1.15.1-r0","1.15.2-r0","1.15.2-r1","1.15.2-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-5709.json"}},{"package":{"name":"krb5","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/krb5?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.15.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.11-r0","1.11-r1","1.11-r2","1.11.2-r0","1.11.2-r1","1.11.2-r2","1.11.3-r0","1.11.4-r0","1.12.1-r0","1.12.2-r0","1.13-r0","1.13-r1","1.13.1-r0","1.13.1-r1","1.13.2-r0","1.13.2-r1","1.13.2-r2","1.14-r0","1.14-r1","1.14-r2","1.14.3-r0","1.14.3-r1","1.14.3-r2","1.15.1-r0","1.15.2-r0","1.15.2-r1","1.15.2-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-5709.json"}},{"package":{"name":"krb5","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/krb5?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.15.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.11-r0","1.11-r1","1.11-r2","1.11.2-r0","1.11.2-r1","1.11.2-r2","1.11.3-r0","1.11.4-r0","1.12.1-r0","1.12.2-r0","1.13-r0","1.13-r1","1.13.1-r0","1.13.1-r1","1.13.2-r0","1.13.2-r1","1.13.2-r2","1.14-r0","1.14-r1","1.14-r2","1.14.3-r0","1.14.3-r1","1.14.3-r2","1.15.1-r0","1.15.2-r0","1.15.2-r1","1.15.2-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-5709.json"}},{"package":{"name":"krb5","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/krb5?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.15.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.11-r0","1.11-r1","1.11-r2","1.11.2-r0","1.11.2-r1","1.11.2-r2","1.11.3-r0","1.11.4-r0","1.12.1-r0","1.12.2-r0","1.13-r0","1.13-r1","1.13.1-r0","1.13.1-r1","1.13.2-r0","1.13.2-r1","1.13.2-r2","1.14-r0","1.14-r1","1.14-r2","1.14.3-r0","1.14.3-r1","1.14.3-r2","1.15.1-r0","1.15.2-r0","1.15.2-r1","1.15.2-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-5709.json"}},{"package":{"name":"krb5","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/krb5?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.15.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.11-r0","1.11-r1","1.11-r2","1.11.2-r0","1.11.2-r1","1.11.2-r2","1.11.3-r0","1.11.4-r0","1.12.1-r0","1.12.2-r0","1.13-r0","1.13-r1","1.13.1-r0","1.13.1-r1","1.13.2-r0","1.13.2-r1","1.13.2-r2","1.14-r0","1.14-r1","1.14-r2","1.14.3-r0","1.14.3-r1","1.14.3-r2","1.15.1-r0","1.15.2-r0","1.15.2-r1","1.15.2-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-5709.json"}},{"package":{"name":"krb5","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/krb5?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.15.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.11-r0","1.11-r1","1.11-r2","1.11.2-r0","1.11.2-r1","1.11.2-r2","1.11.3-r0","1.11.4-r0","1.12.1-r0","1.12.2-r0","1.13-r0","1.13-r1","1.13.1-r0","1.13.1-r1","1.13.2-r0","1.13.2-r1","1.13.2-r2","1.14-r0","1.14-r1","1.14-r2","1.14.3-r0","1.14.3-r1","1.14.3-r2","1.15.1-r0","1.15.2-r0","1.15.2-r1","1.15.2-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-5709.json"}},{"package":{"name":"krb5","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/krb5?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.15.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.11-r0","1.11-r1","1.11-r2","1.11.2-r0","1.11.2-r1","1.11.2-r2","1.11.3-r0","1.11.4-r0","1.12.1-r0","1.12.2-r0","1.13-r0","1.13-r1","1.13.1-r0","1.13.1-r1","1.13.2-r0","1.13.2-r1","1.13.2-r2","1.14-r0","1.14-r1","1.14-r2","1.14.3-r0","1.14.3-r1","1.14.3-r2","1.15.1-r0","1.15.2-r0","1.15.2-r1","1.15.2-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-5709.json"}},{"package":{"name":"krb5","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/krb5?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.15.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.11-r0","1.11-r1","1.11-r2","1.11.2-r0","1.11.2-r1","1.11.2-r2","1.11.3-r0","1.11.4-r0","1.12.1-r0","1.12.2-r0","1.13-r0","1.13-r1","1.13.1-r0","1.13.1-r1","1.13.2-r0","1.13.2-r1","1.13.2-r2","1.14-r0","1.14-r1","1.14-r2","1.14.3-r0","1.14.3-r1","1.14.3-r2","1.15.1-r0","1.15.2-r0","1.15.2-r1","1.15.2-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-5709.json"}},{"package":{"name":"krb5","ecosystem":"Alpine
