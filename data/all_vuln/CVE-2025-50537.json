{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-50537","published":"2026-01-26T16:15:58.330Z","modified":"2026-01-29T06:51:55.037058Z","details":"Stack overflow vulnerability in eslint before 9.26.0 when serializing objects with circular references in eslint/lib/shared/serialization.js. The exploit is triggered via the RuleTester.run() method, which validates test cases and checks for duplicates. During validation, the internal function checkDuplicateTestCase() is called, which in turn uses the isSerializable() function for serialization checks. When a circular reference object is passed in, isSerializable() enters infinite recursion, ultimately causing a stack overflow.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8bbabc4691d97733a422180c71eba6c097b35475"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.2","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.9","v0.1.3","v0.10.1","v0.10.2","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.16.2","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.18.0","v0.19.0","v0.20.0","v0.21.0","v0.21.1","v0.21.2","v0.22.0","v0.22.1","v0.23.0","v0.24.0","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-rc-1","v1.0.0-rc-2","v1.0.0-rc-3","v1.1.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.10.3","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.8.0","v1.9.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-alpha-1","v2.0.0-alpha-2","v2.0.0-beta.1","v2.0.0-beta.2","v2.0.0-beta.3","v2.0.0-rc.0","v2.0.0-rc.1","v2.1.0","v2.10.0","v2.10.1","v2.10.2","v2.11.0","v2.11.1","v2.12.0","v2.13.0","v2.13.1","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v2.5.2","v2.5.3","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.8.0","v2.9.0","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.10.0","v3.10.1","v3.10.2","v3.11.0","v3.11.1","v3.12.0","v3.12.1","v3.12.2","v3.13.0","v3.13.1","v3.14.0","v3.14.1","v3.15.0","v3.16.0","v3.16.1","v3.17.0","v3.17.1","v3.18.0","v3.19.0","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.2.2","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.4.0","v3.5.0","v3.6.0","v3.6.1","v3.7.0","v3.7.1","v3.8.0","v3.8.1","v3.9.0","v3.9.1","v4.0.0","v4.0.0-alpha.0","v4.0.0-alpha.1","v4.0.0-alpha.2","v4.0.0-beta.0","v4.0.0-rc.0","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.10.0","v4.11.0","v4.12.0","v4.12.1","v4.13.0","v4.13.1","v4.14.0","v4.15.0","v4.16.0","v4.17.0","v4.18.0","v4.18.1","v4.18.2","v4.19.0","v4.19.1","v4.2.0","v4.3.0","v4.4.0","v4.4.1","v4.5.0","v4.6.0","v4.6.1","v4.7.0","v4.7.1","v4.7.2","v4.8.0","v5.0.0","v5.0.0-alpha.0","v5.0.0-alpha.1","v5.0.0-alpha.2","v5.0.0-alpha.3","v5.0.0-alpha.4","v5.0.0-rc.0","v5.0.1","v5.1.0","v5.10.0","v5.11.0","v5.11.1","v5.12.0","v5.12.1","v5.13.0","v5.14.0","v5.14.1","v5.15.0","v5.15.1","v5.15.2","v5.15.3","v5.16.0","v5.2.0","v5.3.0","v5.4.0","v5.5.0","v5.6.0","v5.6.1","v5.7.0","v5.8.0","v5.9.0","v6.0.0","v6.0.0-alpha.0","v6.0.0-alpha.1","v6.0.0-alpha.2","v6.0.0-rc.0","v6.0.1","v6.1.0","v6.2.0","v6.2.1","v6.2.2","v6.3.0","v6.4.0","v6.5.0","v6.5.1","v6.6.0","v6.7.0","v6.7.1","v6.7.2","v6.8.0","v7.0.0","v7.0.0-alpha.0","v7.0.0-alpha.1","v7.0.0-alpha.2","v7.0.0-alpha.3","v7.0.0-rc.0","v7.1.0","v7.10.0","v7.11.0","v7.12.0","v7.12.1","v7.13.0","v7.14.0","v7.15.0","v7.16.0","v7.17.0","v7.18.0","v7.19.0","v7.2.0","v7.20.0","v7.21.0","v7.22.0","v7.23.0","v7.24.0","v7.25.0","v7.26.0","v7.27.0","v7.28.0","v7.29.0","v7.3.0","v7.3.1","v7.30.0","v7.31.0","v7.32.0","v7.4.0","v7.5.0","v7.6.0","v7.7.0","v7.8.0","v7.8.1","v7.9.0","v8.0.0","v8.0.0-beta.0","v8.0.0-beta.1","v8.0.0-beta.2","v8.0.0-rc.0","v8.0.1","v8.1.0","v8.10.0","v8.11.0","v8.12.0","v8.13.0","v8.14.0","v8.15.0","v8.16.0","v8.17.0","v8.18.0","v8.19.0","v8.2.0","v8.20.0","v8.21.0","v8.22.0","v8.23.0","v8.23.1","v8.24.0","v8.25.0","v8.26.0","v8.27.0","v8.28.0","v8.29.0","v8.3.0","v8.30.0","v8.31.0","v8.32.0","v8.33.0","v8.34.0","v8.35.0","v8.36.0","v8.37.0","v8.38.0","v8.39.0","v8.4.0","v8.4.1","v8.40.0","v8.41.0","v8.42.0","v8.43.0","v8.44.0","v8.45.0","v8.46.0","v8.47.0","v8.48.0","v8.49.0","v8.5.0","v8.50.0","v8.51.0","v8.52.0","v8.53.0","v8.54.0","v8.55.0","v8.56.0","v8.6.0","v8.7.0","v8.8.0","v8.9.0","v9.0.0","v9.0.0-alpha.0","v9.0.0-alpha.1","v9.0.0-alpha.2","v9.0.0-beta.0","v9.0.0-beta.1","v9.0.0-beta.2","v9.0.0-rc.0","v9.1.0","v9.1.1","v9.10.0","v9.11.0","v9.11.1","v9.12.0","v9.13.0","v9.14.0","v9.15.0","v9.16.0","v9.17.0","v9.18.0","v9.19.0","v9.2.0","v9.20.0","v9.20.1","v9.21.0","v9.22.0","v9.23.0","v9.24.0","v9.25.0","v9.25.1","v9.3.0","v9.4.0","v9.5.0","v9.6.0","v9.7.0","v9.8.0","v9.9.0","v9.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-50537.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://gist.github.com/lyyffee/2ee1815e5c2da82c05e9838b9bfefbbc"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19646"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
