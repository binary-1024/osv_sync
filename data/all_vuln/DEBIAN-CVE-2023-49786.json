In Asterisk prior to versions 18.20.1, 20.5.1, and 21.0.1; as well as certified-asterisk prior to 18.9-cert6; Asterisk is susceptible to a DoS due to a race condition in the hello handshake phase of the DTLS protocol when handling DTLS-SRTP for media setup. This attack can be done continuously, thus denying new DTLS-SRTP encrypted calls during the attack. Abuse of this vulnerability may lead to a massive Denial of Service on vulnerable Asterisk servers for calls that rely on DTLS-SRTP. Commit d7d7764cb07c8a1872804321302ef93bf62cba05 contains a fix, which is part of versions 18.20.1, 20.5.1, 21.0.1, amd 18.9-cert6.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"asterisk","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/asterisk?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb11u4"}]}],"versions":["1:16.16.1~dfsg+~2.10-1","1:16.16.1~dfsg+~2.10-2","1:16.16.1~dfsg-1","1:16.16.1~dfsg-1+deb11u1","1:16.16.1~dfsg-1+deb11u1~bpo10+1","1:16.16.1~dfsg-2","1:16.16.1~dfsg-3","1:16.16.1~dfsg-4","1:16.23.0~dfsg+~2.10-1","1:16.23.0~dfsg+~cs6.10.20220309-1","1:16.23.0~dfsg+~cs6.10.20220309-2","1:16.23.0~dfsg+~cs6.10.40431411-1","1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb11u1","1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb11u2","1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb11u3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-49786.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-49786"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
