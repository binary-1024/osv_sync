Compile tested only.(CVE-2022-48958)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: hisilicon: Fix potential use-after-free in hix5hd2_rx()  The skb is delivered to napi_gro_receive() which may free it, after calling this, dereferencing skb may trigger use-after-free.(CVE-2022-48960)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: mdio: fix unbalanced fwnode reference count in mdio_device_release()  There is warning report about of_node refcount leak while probing mdio device:  OF: ERROR: memory leak, expected refcount 1 instead of 2, of_node_get()/of_node_put() unbalanced - destroy cset entry: attach overlay node /spi/soc@0/mdio@710700c0/ethernet@4  In of_mdiobus_register_device(), we increase fwnode refcount by fwnode_handle_get() before associating the of_node with mdio device, but it has never been decreased in normal path. Since that, in mdio_device_release(), it needs to call fwnode_handle_put() in addition instead of calling kfree() directly.  After above, just calling mdio_device_free() in the error handle path of of_mdiobus_register_device() is enough to keep the refcount balanced.(CVE-2022-48961)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: hisilicon: Fix potential use-after-free in hisi_femac_rx()  The skb is delivered to napi_gro_receive() which may free it, after calling this, dereferencing skb may trigger use-after-free.(CVE-2022-48962)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: mvneta: Prevent out of bounds read in mvneta_config_rss()  The pp-&gt;indir[0] value comes from the user.  It is passed to:   if (cpu_online(pp-&gt;rxq_def))  inside the mvneta_percpu_elect() function.  It needs bounds checkeding to ensure that it is not beyond the end of the cpu bitmap.(CVE-2022-48966)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mac802154: fix missing INIT_LIST_HEAD in ieee802154_if_add()  Kernel fault injection test reports null-ptr-deref as follows:  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008 RIP: 0010:cfg802154_netdev_notifier_call+0x120/0x310 include/linux/list.h:114 Call Trace:  &lt;TASK&gt;  raw_notifier_call_chain+0x6d/0xa0 kernel/notifier.c:87  call_netdevice_notifiers_info+0x6e/0xc0 net/core/dev.c:1944  unregister_netdevice_many_notify+0x60d/0xcb0 net/core/dev.c:1982  unregister_netdevice_queue+0x154/0x1a0 net/core/dev.c:10879  register_netdevice+0x9a8/0xb90 net/core/dev.c:10083  ieee802154_if_add+0x6ed/0x7e0 net/mac802154/iface.c:659  ieee802154_register_hw+0x29c/0x330 net/mac802154/main.c:229  mcr20a_probe+0xaaa/0xcb1 drivers/net/ieee802154/mcr20a.c:1316  ieee802154_if_add() allocates wpan_dev as netdev&apos;s private data, but not init the list in struct wpan_dev. cfg802154_netdev_notifier_call() manage the list when device register/unregister, and may lead to null-ptr-deref.  Use INIT_LIST_HEAD() on it to initialize it correctly.(CVE-2022-48972)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gpiolib: fix memory leak in gpiochip_setup_dev()  Here is a backtrace report about memory leak detected in gpiochip_setup_dev():  unreferenced object 0xffff88810b406400 (size 512):   comm &quot;python3&quot;, pid 1682, jiffies 4295346908 (age 24.090s)   backtrace:     kmalloc_trace     device_add  device_private_init at drivers/base/core.c:3361    (inlined by) device_add at drivers/base/core.c:3411     cdev_device_add     gpiolib_cdev_register     gpiochip_setup_dev     gpiochip_add_data_with_key  gcdev_register() &amp; gcdev_unregister() would call device_add() &amp; device_del() (no matter CONFIG_GPIO_CDEV is enabled or not) to register/unregister device.  However, if device_add() succeeds, some resource (like struct device_private allocated by device_private_init()) is not released by device_del().  Therefore, after device_add() succeeds by gcdev_register(), it needs to call put_device() to release resource in the error handle path.  Here we move forward the register of release function, and let it release every piece of resource by put_device() instead of kfree().

This series addresses three potential issues with empty b-tree nodes that can occur with corrupted filesystem images, including one recently discovered by syzbot.   This patch (of 3):  If a b-tree is broken on the device, and the b-tree height is greater than 2 (the level of the root node is greater than 1) even if the number of child nodes of the b-tree root is 0, a NULL pointer dereference occurs in nilfs_btree_prepare_insert(), which is called from nilfs_btree_insert().  This is because, when the number of child nodes of the b-tree root is 0, nilfs_btree_do_lookup() does not set the block buffer head in any of path[x].bp_bh, leaving it as the initial value of NULL, but if the level of the b-tree root node is greater than 1, nilfs_btree_get_nonroot_node(), which accesses the buffer memory of path[x].bp_bh, is called.  Fix this issue by adding a check to nilfs_btree_root_broken(), which performs sanity checks when reading the root node from the device, to detect this inconsistency.

This happens because file system can not filter out the positive number returned by the LSM prog using IS_ERR, and misinterprets this positive number as a file pointer.  Given that hook file_alloc_security never returned positive number before the introduction of BPF LSM, and other BPF LSM hooks may encounter similar issues, this patch adds LSM return value check in verifier, to ensure no unexpected value is returned.(CVE-2024-47703)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: fix potential invalid pointer dereference in blk_add_partition  The blk_add_partition() function initially used a single if-condition (IS_ERR(part)) to check for errors when adding a partition. This was modified to handle the specific case of -ENXIO separately, allowing the function to proceed without logging the error in this case. However, this change unintentionally left a path where md_autodetect_dev() could be called without confirming that part is a valid pointer.  This commit separates the error handling logic by splitting the initial if-condition, improving code readability and handling specific error scenarios explicitly. The function now distinguishes the general error case from -ENXIO without altering the existing behavior of md_autodetect_dev() calls.(CVE-2024-47705)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  jfs: fix out-of-bounds in dbNextAG() and diAlloc()  In dbNextAG() , there is no check for the case where bmp-&gt;db_numag is greater or same than MAXAG due to a polluted image, which causes an out-of-bounds. Therefore, a bounds check should be added in dbMount().  And in dbNextAG(), a check for the case where agpref is greater than bmp-&gt;db_numag should be added, so an out-of-bounds exception should be prevented.  Additionally, a check for the case where agno is greater or same than MAXAG should be added in diAlloc() to prevent out-of-bounds.(CVE-2024-47723)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  padata: use integer wrap around to prevent deadlock on seq_nr overflow  When submitting more than 2^32 padata objects to padata_do_serial, the current sorting implementation incorrectly sorts padata objects with overflowed seq_nr, causing them to be placed before existing objects in the reorder list. This leads to a deadlock in the serialization process as padata_find_next cannot match padata-&gt;seq_nr and pd-&gt;processed because the padata instance with overflowed seq_nr will be selected next.  To fix this, we use an unsigned integer wrap around to correctly sort padata objects in scenarios with integer overflow.(CVE-2024-47739)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware_loader: Block path traversal  Most firmware names are hardcoded strings, or are constructed from fairly constrained format strings where the dynamic parts are just some hex numbers or such.  However, there are a couple codepaths in the kernel where firmware file names contain string components that are passed through from a device or semi-privileged userspace; the ones I could find (not counting interfaces that require root privileges) are:   - lpfc_sli4_request_firmware_update() seems to construct the firmware    filename from &quot;ModelName&quot;, a string that was previously parsed out of    some descriptor (&quot;Vital Product Data&quot;) in lpfc_fill_vpd()  - nfp_net_fw_find() seems to construct a firmware filename from a model    name coming from nfp_hwinfo_lookup(pf-&gt;hwinfo, &quot;nffw.partno&quot;), which I    think parses some descriptor that was read from the device.    (But this case likely isn&apos;t exploitable because the format string looks    like &quot;netronome/nic_%s&quot;, and there shouldn&apos;t be any *folders* starting    with &quot;netronome/nic_&quot;. The previous case was different because there,    the &quot;%s&quot; is *at the start* of the format string.)  - module_flash_fw_schedule() is reachable from the    ETHTOOL_MSG_MODULE_FW_FLASH_ACT netlink command, which is marked as    GENL_UNS_ADMIN_PERM (meaning CAP_NET_ADMIN inside a user namespace is    enough to pass the privilege check), and takes a userspace-provided    firmware name.    (But I think to reach this case, you need to have CAP_NET_ADMIN over a    network namespace that a special kind of ethernet device is mapped into,    so I think this is not a viable attack path in practice.)  Fix it by rejecting any firmware names containing &quot;..&quot; path components.  For what it&apos;s worth, I went looking and haven&apos;t found any USB device drivers that use the firmware loader dangerously.(CVE-2024-47742)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vhost_vdpa: assign irq bypass producer token correctly  We used to call irq_bypass_unregister_producer() in vhost_vdpa_setup_vq_irq() which is problematic as we don&apos;t know if the token pointer is still valid or not.  Actually, we use the eventfd_ctx as the token so the life cycle of the token should be bound to the VHOST_SET_VRING_CALL instead of vhost_vdpa_setup_vq_irq() which could be called by set_status().  Fixing this by setting up irq bypass producer&apos;s token when handling VHOST_SET_VRING_CALL and un-registering the producer before calling vhost_vring_ioctl() to prevent a possible use after free as eventfd could have been released in vhost_vring_ioctl(). And such registering and unregistering will only be done if DRIVER_OK is set.(CVE-2024-47748)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: keystone: Fix if-statement expression in ks_pcie_quirk()  This code accidentally uses &amp;&amp; where || was intended.  It potentially results in a NULL dereference.  Thus, fix the if-statement expression to use the correct condition.  [kwilczynski: commit log](CVE-2024-47756)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nbd: fix race between timeout and normal completion  If request timetout is handled by nbd_requeue_cmd(), normal completion has to be stopped for avoiding to complete this requeued request, other use-after-free can be triggered.  Fix the race by clearing NBD_CMD_INFLIGHT in nbd_requeue_cmd(), meantime make sure that cmd-&gt;lock is grabbed for clearing the flag and the requeue.(CVE-2024-49855)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  efistub/tpm: Use ACPI reclaim memory for event log to avoid corruption  The TPM event log table is a Linux specific construct, where the data produced by the GetEventLog() boot service is cached in memory, and passed on to the OS using an EFI configuration table.  The use of EFI_LOADER_DATA here results in the region being left unreserved in the E820 memory map constructed by the EFI stub, and this is the memory description that is passed on to the incoming kernel by kexec, which is therefore unaware that the region should be reserved.  Even though the utility of the TPM2 event log after a kexec is questionable, any corruption might send the parsing code off into the weeds and crash the kernel. So let&apos;s use EFI_ACPI_RECLAIM_MEMORY instead, which is always treated as reserved by the E820 conversion logic.(CVE-2024-49858)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ACPI: sysfs: validate return type of _STR method  Only buffer objects are valid return values of _STR.  If something else is returned description_show() will access invalid memory.(CVE-2024-49860)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vhost/scsi: null-ptr-dereference in vhost_scsi_get_req()  Since commit 3f8ca2e115e5 (&quot;vhost/scsi: Extract common handling code from control queue handler&quot;) a null pointer dereference bug can be triggered when guest sends an SCSI AN request.  In vhost_scsi_ctl_handle_vq(), `vc.target` is assigned with `&amp;v_req.tmf.lun[1]` within a switch-case block and is then passed to vhost_scsi_get_req() which extracts `vc-&gt;req` and `tpg`. However, for a `VIRTIO_SCSI_T_AN_*` request, tpg is not required, so `vc.target` is set to NULL in this branch. Later, in vhost_scsi_get_req(), `vc-&gt;target` is dereferenced without being checked, leading to a null pointer dereference bug. This bug can be triggered from guest.  When this bug occurs, the vhost_worker process is killed while holding `vq-&gt;mutex` and the corresponding tpg will remain occupied indefinitely.

Since dump_mapping() only needs to dump the filename only, retrieve it by itself in a safer way to prevent an unnecessary crash.  Note that either retrieving the filename with &apos;%pd&apos; or strncpy_from_kernel_nofault(), the filename could be unreliable.(CVE-2024-49934)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/xen-netback: prevent UAF in xenvif_flush_hash()  During the list_for_each_entry_rcu iteration call of xenvif_flush_hash, kfree_rcu does not exist inside the rcu read critical section, so if kfree_rcu is called when the rcu grace period ends during the iteration, UAF occurs when accessing head-&gt;next after the entry becomes free.  Therefore, to solve this, you need to change it to list_for_each_entry_safe.(CVE-2024-49936)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  l2tp: prevent possible tunnel refcount underflow  When a session is created, it sets a backpointer to its tunnel. When the session refcount drops to 0, l2tp_session_free drops the tunnel refcount if session-&gt;tunnel is non-NULL. However, session-&gt;tunnel is set in l2tp_session_create, before the tunnel refcount is incremented by l2tp_session_register, which leaves a small window where session-&gt;tunnel is non-NULL when the tunnel refcount hasn&apos;t been bumped.  Moving the assignment to l2tp_session_register is trivial but l2tp_session_create calls l2tp_session_set_header_len which uses session-&gt;tunnel to get the tunnel&apos;s encap. Add an encap arg to l2tp_session_set_header_len to avoid using session-&gt;tunnel.  If l2tpv3 sessions have colliding IDs, it is possible for l2tp_v3_session_get to race with l2tp_session_register and fetch a session which doesn&apos;t yet have session-&gt;tunnel set. Add a check for this case.(CVE-2024-49940)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix uaf in l2cap_connect  [Syzbot reported] BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in l2cap_connect.constprop.0+0x10d8/0x1270 net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c:3949 Read of size 8 at addr ffff8880241e9800 by task kworker/u9:0/54  CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 54 Comm: kworker/u9:0 Not tainted 6.11.0-rc6-syzkaller-00268-g788220eee30d #0 Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 08/06/2024 Workqueue: hci2 hci_rx_work Call Trace:  &lt;TASK&gt;  __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:93 [inline]  dump_stack_lvl+0x116/0x1f0 lib/dump_stack.c:119  print_address_description mm/kasan/report.c:377 [inline]  print_report+0xc3/0x620 mm/kasan/report.c:488  kasan_report+0xd9/0x110 mm/kasan/report.c:601  l2cap_connect.constprop.0+0x10d8/0x1270 net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c:3949  l2cap_connect_req net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c:4080 [inline]  l2cap_bredr_sig_cmd net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c:4772 [inline]  l2cap_sig_channel net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c:5543 [inline]  l2cap_recv_frame+0xf0b/0x8eb0 net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c:6825  l2cap_recv_acldata+0x9b4/0xb70 net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c:7514  hci_acldata_packet net/bluetooth/hci_core.c:3791 [inline]  hci_rx_work+0xaab/0x1610 net/bluetooth/hci_core.c:4028  process_one_work+0x9c5/0x1b40 kernel/workqueue.c:3231  process_scheduled_works kernel/workqueue.c:3312 [inline]  worker_thread+0x6c8/0xed0 kernel/workqueue.c:3389  kthread+0x2c1/0x3a0 kernel/kthread.c:389  ret_from_fork+0x45/0x80 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:147  ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:244 ...

That&apos;s not really justified, because the failure case must be correctly handled by the well known call chain and the error code is passed through to the initiating userspace application.  A memory allocation fail is not a fatal problem, but the WARN_ON() takes the machine out when panic_on_warn is set.  Replace it with a pr_warn().(CVE-2024-49954)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ACPI: battery: Fix possible crash when unregistering a battery hook  When a battery hook returns an error when adding a new battery, then the battery hook is automatically unregistered. However the battery hook provider cannot know that, so it will later call battery_hook_unregister() on the already unregistered battery hook, resulting in a crash.  Fix this by using the list head to mark already unregistered battery hooks as already being unregistered so that they can be ignored by battery_hook_unregister().(CVE-2024-49955)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ocfs2: reserve space for inline xattr before attaching reflink tree  One of our customers reported a crash and a corrupted ocfs2 filesystem.

The issue was in the reflink workfow while reserving space for inline xattr.  The problematic function is ocfs2_reflink_xattr_inline().  By the time this function is called the reflink tree is already recreated at the destination inode from the source inode.  At this point, this function reserves space for inline xattrs at the destination inode without even checking if there is space at the root metadata block.  It simply reduces the l_count from 243 to 227 thereby making space of 256 bytes for inline xattr whereas the inode already has extents beyond this index (in this case up to 230), thereby causing corruption.  The fix for this is to reserve space for inline metadata at the destination inode before the reflink tree gets recreated. The customer has verified the fix.(CVE-2024-49958)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ocfs2: remove unreasonable unlock in ocfs2_read_blocks  Patch series &quot;Misc fixes for ocfs2_read_blocks&quot;, v5.

On some architectures (x86) this memory is readable even without VM_READ, VM_EXEC results in the same pgprot_t as VM_EXEC|VM_READ, although this doesn&apos;t really matter, debugger can read this memory anyway.(CVE-2024-49975)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gso: fix udp gso fraglist segmentation after pull from frag_list  Detect gso fraglist skbs with corrupted geometry (see below) and pass these to skb_segment instead of skb_segment_list, as the first can segment them correctly.  Valid SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST skbs - consist of two or more segments - the head_skb holds the protocol headers plus first gso_size - one or more frag_list skbs hold exactly one segment - all but the last must be gso_size  Optional datapath hooks such as NAT and BPF (bpf_skb_pull_data) can modify these skbs, breaking these invariants.  In extreme cases they pull all data into skb linear. For UDP, this causes a NULL ptr deref in __udpv4_gso_segment_list_csum at udp_hdr(seg-&gt;next)-&gt;dest.  Detect invalid geometry due to pull, by checking head_skb size. Don&apos;t just drop, as this may blackhole a destination.

So to get DataBuffer size it is needed to subtract InodeType&apos;s size from ReparseDataLength.  Function cifs_strndup_from_utf16() is currentlly accessing buf-&gt;DataBuffer at position after the end of the buffer because it does not subtract InodeType size from the length. Fix this problem and correctly subtract variable len.  Member InodeType is present only when reparse buffer is large enough. Check for ReparseDataLength before accessing InodeType to prevent another invalid memory access.  Major and minor rdev values are present also only when reparse buffer is large enough.

If the process is killed by user(See signal handling in dax_iomap_iter()), the copied data will be returned and added on inode size, which means that the length of written extents may exceed the inode size, then fsck will fail. An example is given as:  dd if=/dev/urandom of=file bs=4M count=1  dax_iomap_rw   iomap_iter // round 1    ext4_iomap_begin     ext4_iomap_alloc // allocate 0~2M extents(written flag)   dax_iomap_iter // copy 2M data   iomap_iter // round 2    iomap_iter_advance     iter-&gt;pos += iter-&gt;processed // iter-&gt;pos = 2M    ext4_iomap_begin     ext4_iomap_alloc // allocate 2~4M extents(written flag)   dax_iomap_iter    fatal_signal_pending   done = iter-&gt;pos - iocb-&gt;ki_pos // done = 2M  ext4_handle_inode_extension   ext4_update_inode_size // inode size = 2M  fsck reports: Inode 13, i_size is 2097152, should be 4194304.  Fix?  Fix the problem by truncating extents if the written length is smaller than expected.(CVE-2024-50015)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Avoid overflow assignment in link_dp_cts  sampling_rate is an uint8_t but is assigned an unsigned int, and thus it can overflow. As a result, sampling_rate is changed to uint32_t.  Similarly, LINK_QUAL_PATTERN_SET has a size of 2 bits, and it should only be assigned to a value less or equal than 4.  This fixes 2 INTEGER_OVERFLOW issues reported by Coverity.(CVE-2024-50016)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  thermal: core: Reference count the zone in thermal_zone_get_by_id()  There are places in the thermal netlink code where nothing prevents the thermal zone object from going away while being accessed after it has been returned by thermal_zone_get_by_id().  To address this, make thermal_zone_get_by_id() get a reference on the thermal zone device object to be returned with the help of get_device(), under thermal_list_lock, and adjust all of its callers to this change with the help of the cleanup.h infrastructure.(CVE-2024-50028)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  slip: make slhc_remember() more robust against malicious packets  syzbot found that slhc_remember() was missing checks against malicious packets [1].  slhc_remember() only checked the size of the packet was at least 20, which is not good enough.

It added one to uart_shutdown(), so the commit assumes, uport can be NULL in there. But right after that protection, there is an unprotected &quot;uart_port_dtr_rts(uport, false);&quot; call. That is invoked only if HUPCL is set, so I assume that is the reason why we do not see lots of these reports.  Or it cannot be NULL at this point at all for some reason :P.  Until the above is investigated, stay on the safe side and move this dereference to the if too.  I got this inconsistency from Coverity under CID 1585130.

The sequence of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:  CPU0                                 CPU1                          | check_link_status_work switchtec_ntb_remove    | kfree(sndev);           |                         | if (sndev-&gt;link_force_down)                         | // use sndev  Fix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with the cleanup in switchtec_ntb_remove.(CVE-2024-50059)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring: check if we need to reschedule during overflow flush  In terms of normal application usage, this list will always be empty. And if an application does overflow a bit, it&apos;ll have a few entries. However, nothing obviously prevents syzbot from running a test case that generates a ton of overflow entries, and then flushing them can take quite a while.  Check for needing to reschedule while flushing, and drop our locks and do so if necessary. There&apos;s no state to maintain here as overflows always prune from head-of-list, hence it&apos;s fine to drop and reacquire the locks at the end of the loop.(CVE-2024-50060)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Prevent tail call between progs attached to different hooks  bpf progs can be attached to kernel functions, and the attached functions can take different parameters or return different return values. If prog attached to one kernel function tail calls prog attached to another kernel function, the ctx access or return value verification could be bypassed.  For example, if prog1 is attached to func1 which takes only 1 parameter and prog2 is attached to func2 which takes two parameters. Since verifier assumes the bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed based on func2&apos;s prototype, verifier allows prog2 to access the second parameter from the bpf ctx passed to it. The problem is that verifier does not prevent prog1 from passing its bpf ctx to prog2 via tail call. In this case, the bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed from func1 instead of func2, that is, the assumption for ctx access verification is bypassed.  Another example, if BPF LSM prog1 is attached to hook file_alloc_security, and BPF LSM prog2 is attached to hook bpf_lsm_audit_rule_known. Verifier knows the return value rules for these two hooks, e.g. it is legal for bpf_lsm_audit_rule_known to return positive number 1, and it is illegal for file_alloc_security to return positive number. So verifier allows prog2 to return positive number 1, but does not allow prog1 to return positive number. The problem is that verifier does not prevent prog1 from calling prog2 via tail call. In this case, prog2&apos;s return value 1 will be used as the return value for prog1&apos;s hook file_alloc_security. That is, the return value rule is bypassed.  This patch adds restriction for tail call to prevent such bypasses.(CVE-2024-50063)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  uprobe: avoid out-of-bounds memory access of fetching args  Uprobe needs to fetch args into a percpu buffer, and then copy to ring buffer to avoid non-atomic context problem.  Sometimes user-space strings, arrays can be very large, but the size of percpu buffer is only page size. And store_trace_args() won&apos;t check whether these data exceeds a single page or not, caused out-of-bounds memory access.  It could be reproduced by following steps: 1. build kernel with CONFIG_KASAN enabled 2. save follow program as test.c  ``` \\#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; \\#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; \\#include &lt;string.h&gt;  // If string length large than MAX_STRING_SIZE, the fetch_store_strlen() // will return 0, cause __get_data_size() return shorter size, and // store_trace_args() will not trigger out-of-bounds access. // So make string length less than 4096. \\#define STRLEN 4093  void generate_string(char *str, int n) {     int i;     for (i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)     {         char c = i % 26 + &apos;a&apos;;         str[i] = c;     }     str[n-1] = &apos;\\0&apos;; }  void print_string(char *str) {     printf(&quot;%s\\n&quot;, str); }  int main() {     char tmp[STRLEN];      generate_string(tmp, STRLEN);     print_string(tmp);      return 0; } ``` 3. compile program `gcc -o test test.c`  4. get the offset of `print_string()` ``` objdump -t test | grep -w print_string 0000000000401199 g     F .text  000000000000001b              print_string ```  5. configure uprobe with offset 0x1199 ``` off=0x1199  cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/ echo &quot;p /root/test:${off} arg1=+0(%di):ustring arg2=\\$comm arg3=+0(%di):ustring&quot;  &gt; uprobe_events echo 1 &gt; events/uprobes/enable echo 1 &gt; tracing_on ```  6. run `test`, and kasan will report error. ================================================================== BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in strncpy_from_user+0x1d6/0x1f0 Write of size 8 at addr ffff88812311c004 by task test/499CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 499 Comm: test Not tainted 6.12.0-rc3+ #18 Hardware name: Red Hat KVM, BIOS 1.16.0-4.al8 04/01/2014 Call Trace:  &lt;TASK&gt;  dump_stack_lvl+0x55/0x70  print_address_description.constprop.0+0x27/0x310  kasan_report+0x10f/0x120  ? strncpy_from_user+0x1d6/0x1f0  strncpy_from_user+0x1d6/0x1f0  ? rmqueue.constprop.0+0x70d/0x2ad0  process_fetch_insn+0xb26/0x1470  ? __pfx_process_fetch_insn+0x10/0x10  ? _raw_spin_lock+0x85/0xe0  ? __pfx__raw_spin_lock+0x10/0x10  ? __pte_offset_map+0x1f/0x2d0  ? unwind_next_frame+0xc5f/0x1f80  ? arch_stack_walk+0x68/0xf0  ? is_bpf_text_address+0x23/0x30  ? kernel_text_address.part.0+0xbb/0xd0  ? __kernel_text_address+0x66/0xb0  ? unwind_get_return_address+0x5e/0xa0  ? __pfx_stack_trace_consume_entry+0x10/0x10  ? arch_stack_walk+0xa2/0xf0  ? _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x8b/0xf0  ? __pfx__raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x10/0x10  ? depot_alloc_stack+0x4c/0x1f0  ? _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore+0xe/0x30  ? stack_depot_save_flags+0x35d/0x4f0  ? kasan_save_stack+0x34/0x50  ? kasan_save_stack+0x24/0x50  ? mutex_lock+0x91/0xe0  ? __pfx_mutex_lock+0x10/0x10  prepare_uprobe_buffer.part.0+0x2cd/0x500  uprobe_dispatcher+0x2c3/0x6a0  ? __pfx_uprobe_dispatcher+0x10/0x10  ? __kasan_slab_alloc+0x4d/0x90  handler_chain+0xdd/0x3e0  handle_swbp+0x26e/0x3d0  ? __pfx_handle_swbp+0x10/0x10  ? uprobe_pre_sstep_notifier+0x151/0x1b0  irqentry_exit_to_user_mode+0xe2/0x1b0  asm_exc_int3+0x39/0x40 RIP: 0033:0x401199 Code: 01 c2 0f b6 45 fb 88 02 83 45 fc 01 8b 45 fc 3b 45 e4 7c b7 8b 45 e4 48 98 48 8d 50 ff 48 8b 45 e8 48 01 d0 ce RSP: 002b:00007ffdf00576a8 EFLAGS: 00000206 RAX: 00007ffdf00576b0 RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX: 0000000000000ff2 RDX: 0000000000000ffc RSI: 0000000000000ffd RDI: 00007ffdf00576b0 RBP: 00007ffdf00586b0 R08: 00007feb2f9c0d20 R09: 00007feb2f9c0d20 R10: 0000000000000001 R11: 0000000000000202 R12: 0000000000401040 R13: 00007ffdf0058780 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: 0000000000000000  &lt;/TASK&gt;  This commit enforces the buffer&apos;s maxlen less than a page-size to avoid store_trace_args() out-of-memory access.(CVE-2024-50067)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  parport: Proper fix for array out-of-bounds access  The recent fix for array out-of-bounds accesses replaced sprintf() calls blindly with snprintf().  However, since snprintf() returns the would-be-printed size, not the actually output size, the length calculation can still go over the given limit.  Use scnprintf() instead of snprintf(), which returns the actually output letters, for addressing the potential out-of-bounds access properly.(CVE-2024-50074)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tcp: fix mptcp DSS corruption due to large pmtu xmit  Syzkaller was able to trigger a DSS corruption:    TCP: request_sock_subflow_v4: Possible SYN flooding on port [::]:20002.
