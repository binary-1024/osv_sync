Prior to version 5.4.1, due to default case-insensitive collation in MySQL or MariaDB databases, third-party authentication user IDs are not case-sensitive and could cause different IDs to match. This issue has been addressed by a fix released in version 5.4.1. An immediate workaround would be to change collation of the affected field.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"social-auth-app-django","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/social-auth-app-django?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.1.0-2.1","5.0.0-1","5.2.0-1","5.2.0-2","5.4.0-1","5.4.1-1","5.4.2-1","5.4.3-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-32879.json"}},{"package":{"name":"social-auth-app-django","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/social-auth-app-django?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.0.0-1","5.2.0-1","5.2.0-2","5.4.0-1","5.4.1-1","5.4.2-1","5.4.3-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-32879.json"}},{"package":{"name":"social-auth-app-django","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/social-auth-app-django?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.4.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-32879.json"}},{"package":{"name":"social-auth-app-django","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/social-auth-app-django?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.4.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-32879.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-32879"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
