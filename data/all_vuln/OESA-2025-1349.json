It is available as a daemon for Linux and Windows, which can manage the complete container lifecycle of its host system: image transfer and storage, container execution and supervision, low-level storage and network attachments, etc.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\ncontainerd is an open-source container runtime. A bug was found in containerd prior to versions 1.6.38, 1.7.27, and 2.0.4 where containers launched with a User set as a `UID:GID` larger than the maximum 32-bit signed integer can cause an overflow condition where the container ultimately runs as root (UID 0). This could cause unexpected behavior for environments that require containers to run as a non-root user. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.38, 1.7.27, and 2.04. As a workaround, ensure that only trusted images are used and that only trusted users have permissions to import images.(CVE-2024-40635)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"containerd","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/containerd&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.6.22-16.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["containerd-1.6.22-16.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["containerd-1.6.22-16.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["containerd-1.6.22-16.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1349.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-1349"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-40635"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
