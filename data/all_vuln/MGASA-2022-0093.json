  "details": "An attacker could have caused a use-after-free by forcing a text reflow in an\nSVG object leading to a potentially exploitable crash (CVE-2022-26381).\n\nWhen resizing a popup after requesting fullscreen access, the popup would not\ndisplay the fullscreen notification (CVE-2022-26383).\n\nIf an attacker could control the contents of an iframe sandboxed with\nallow-popups but not allow-scripts, they were able to craft a link that, when\nclicked, would lead to JavaScript execution in violation of the sandbox\n(CVE-2022-26384).\n\nPreviously Firefox for macOS and Linux would download temporary files to a\nuser-specific directory in /tmp, but this behavior was changed to download\nthem to /tmp where they could be affected by other local users. This behavior\nwas reverted to the original, user-specific directory (CVE-2022-26386).\n\nWhen installing an add-on, Firefox verified the signature before prompting\nthe user; but while the user was confirming the prompt, the underlying add-on\nfile could have been modified and Firefox would not have noticed\n(CVE-2022-26387).\n",
