  "details": "Updated mariadb packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nVulnerability in the MariaDB Server component of MariaDB (subcomponent:\nServer: Replication). Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows\nunauthenticated attacker with logon to the infrastructure where MariaDB\nServer executes to compromise MariaDB Server. Successful attacks require\nhuman interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the\nvulnerability is in MariaDB Server, attacks may significantly impact\nadditional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result\nin takeover of MariaDB Server (CVE-2018-2755).\n\nVulnerability in the MariaDB Server component of MariaDB (subcomponent:\nClient programs). Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated\nattacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MariaDB\nServer. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized\nability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of\nMariaDB Server (CVE-2018-2761).\n\nVulnerability in the MariaDB Server component of MariaDB (subcomponent:\nInnoDB). Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker\nwith network access via multiple protocols to compromise MariaDB Server.\nSuccessful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability\nto cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MariaDB\nServer (CVE-2018-2766).\n\nVulnerability in the MariaDB Server component of MariaDB (subcomponent:\nServer: Locking). Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows high privileged\nattacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MariaDB\nServer. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized\nability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of\nMariaDB Server (CVE-2018-2771).\n\nVulnerability in the MariaDB Server component of MariaDB (subcomponent:\nServer: Optimizer). Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged\nattacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MariaDB\nServer. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized\nability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of\nMariaDB Server (CVE-2018-2781).\n\nVulnerability in the MariaDB Server component of MariaDB (subcomponent:\nInnoDB). Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker\nwith network access via multiple protocols to compromise MariaDB Server.\nSuccessful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability\nto cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MariaDB\nServer (CVE-2018-2782).\n\nVulnerability in the MariaDB Server component of MariaDB (subcomponent:\nInnoDB). Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker\nwith network access via multiple protocols to compromise MariaDB Server.\nSuccessful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability\nto cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MariaDB\nServer (CVE-2018-2784).\n\nVulnerability in the MariaDB Server component of MariaDB (subcomponent:\nInnoDB). Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker\nwith network access via multiple protocols to compromise MariaDB Server.\nSuccessful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability\nto cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MariaDB\nServer as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of\nMariaDB Server accessible data (CVE-2018-2787).\n\nVulnerability in the MariaDB Server component of MariaDB (subcomponent:\nServer: DDL). Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged\nattacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MariaDB\nServer. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized\nread access to a subset of MariaDB Server accessible data (CVE-2018-2813).\n\nVulnerability in the MariaDB Server component of MariaDB (subcomponent:\nServer: DDL).
