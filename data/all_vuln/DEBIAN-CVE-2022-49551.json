  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: isp1760: Fix out-of-bounds array access  Running the driver through kasan gives an interesting splat:    BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in isp1760_register+0x180/0x70c   Read of size 20 at addr f1db2e64 by task swapper/0/1   (...)   isp1760_register from isp1760_plat_probe+0x1d8/0x220   (...)  This happens because the loop reading the regmap fields for the different ISP1760 variants look like this:    for (i = 0; i < HC_FIELD_MAX; i++) { ... }  Meaning it expects the arrays to be at least HC_FIELD_MAX - 1 long.  However the arrays isp1760_hc_reg_fields[], isp1763_hc_reg_fields[], isp1763_hc_volatile_ranges[] and isp1763_dc_volatile_ranges[] are dynamically sized during compilation.  Fix this by putting an empty assignment to the [HC_FIELD_MAX] and [DC_FIELD_MAX] array member at the end of each array. This will make the array one member longer than it needs to be, but avoids the risk of overwriting whatever is inside [HC_FIELD_MAX - 1] and is simple and intuitive to read. Also add comments explaining what is going on.",
