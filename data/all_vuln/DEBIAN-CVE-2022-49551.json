{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49551","published":"2025-02-26T07:01:30Z","modified":"2025-09-30T03:54:38Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-49551"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: isp1760: Fix out-of-bounds array access  Running the driver through kasan gives an interesting splat:    BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in isp1760_register+0x180/0x70c   Read of size 20 at addr f1db2e64 by task swapper/0/1   (...)   isp1760_register from isp1760_plat_probe+0x1d8/0x220   (...)  This happens because the loop reading the regmap fields for the different ISP1760 variants look like this:    for (i = 0; i < HC_FIELD_MAX; i++) { ... }  Meaning it expects the arrays to be at least HC_FIELD_MAX - 1 long.  However the arrays isp1760_hc_reg_fields[], isp1763_hc_reg_fields[], isp1763_hc_volatile_ranges[] and isp1763_dc_volatile_ranges[] are dynamically sized during compilation.  Fix this by putting an empty assignment to the [HC_FIELD_MAX] and [DC_FIELD_MAX] array member at the end of each array. This will make the array one member longer than it needs to be, but avoids the risk of overwriting whatever is inside [HC_FIELD_MAX - 1] and is simple and intuitive to read. Also add comments explaining what is going on.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49551.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49551.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49551.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-49551"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"}]}
