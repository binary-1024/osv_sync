But beyond that valid range we might leave some stale data that could either point to some other VFs allocations or even to the PF pages.  Explicitly clear all new LMTT page to avoid the risk that a malicious VF would try to exploit that gap.  While around add asserts to catch any undesired PTE overwrites and low-level debug traces to track LMTT PT life-cycle.
