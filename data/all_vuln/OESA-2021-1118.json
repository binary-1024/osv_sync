It has been developed in order to promote the use of JPEG 2000, a still-image compression standard from the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG). Since April 2015, it is officially recognized by ISO/IEC and ITU-T as a JPEG 2000 Reference Software.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA heap-buffer overflow was found in the way openjpeg2 handled certain PNG format files. An attacker could use this flaw to cause an application crash or in some cases execute arbitrary code with the permission of the user running such an application.(CVE-2020-27814)\r\n\r\nTheres a flaw in openjpeg in versions prior to 2.4.0 in src/lib/openjp2/pi.c. When an attacker is able to provide crafted input to be processed by the openjpeg encoder, this could cause an out-of-bounds read. The greatest impact from this flaw is to application availability.(CVE-2020-27841)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in OpenJPEG in versions prior to 2.4.0. This flaw allows an attacker to provide specially crafted input to the conversion or encoding functionality, causing an out-of-bounds read. The highest threat from this vulnerability is system availability.(CVE-2020-27843)\r\n\r\nTheres a flaw in src/lib/openjp2/pi.c of openjpeg in versions prior to 2.4.0.
