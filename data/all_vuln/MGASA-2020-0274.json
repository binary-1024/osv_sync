  "details": "Updated nss and firefox packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nNSS has shown timing differences when performing DSA signatures, which\nwas exploitable and could eventually leak private keys (CVE-2020-12399).\n\nSide channel vulnerabilities during RSA key generation in NSS\n(CVE-2020-12402).\n\nWhen browsing a malicious page, a race condition in our \nSharedWorkerService could occur and lead to a potentially exploitable\ncrash due to a use-after-free (CVE-2020-12405).\n\nMozilla developer Iain Ireland discovered a missing type check during\nunboxed objects removal, resulting in a crash due to type confusion with\nNativeTypes. We presume that with enough effort that it could be exploited\nto run arbitrary code (CVE-2020-12406).\n\nMozilla developers Tom Tung and Karl Tomlinson reported memory safety bugs\npresent in Firefox ESR 68.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory\ncorruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have\nbeen exploited to run arbitrary code (CVE-2020-12410).\n\nManipulating individual parts of a URL object could have caused an\nout-of-bounds read, leaking process memory to malicious JavaScript\n(CVE-2020-12418).\n\nWhen processing callbacks that occurred during window flushing in the parent\nprocess, the associated window may die; causing a use-after-free in\nnsGlobalWindowInner. This could have led to memory corruption and a\npotentially exploitable crash (CVE-2020-12419).\n\nWhen trying to connect to a STUN server, a race condition could have caused a\nuse-after-free of a pointer, leading to memory corruption and a potentially\nexploitable crash (CVE-2020-12420).\n\nWhen performing add-on updates, certificate chains terminating in\nnon-built-in-roots were rejected (even if they were legitimately added by an\nadministrator.) This could have caused add-ons to become out-of-date silently\nwithout notification to the user (CVE-2020-12421).\n",
