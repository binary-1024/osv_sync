This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-165329981References: Upstream kernel(CVE-2022-20566)\n\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.16-rc6. netvsc_get_ethtool_stats in drivers/net/hyperv/netvsc_drv.c lacks check of the return value of kvmalloc_array() and will cause the null pointer dereference.(CVE-2022-3107)\n\nGuests can trigger NIC interface reset/abort/crash via netback It is possible for a guest to trigger a NIC interface reset/abort/crash in a Linux based network backend by sending certain kinds of packets. It appears to be an (unwritten?) assumption in the rest of the Linux network stack that packet protocol headers are all contained within the linear section of the SKB and some NICs behave badly if this is not the case. This has been reported to occur with Cisco (enic) and Broadcom NetXtrem II BCM5780 (bnx2x) though it may be an issue with other NICs/drivers as well. In case the frontend is sending requests with split headers, netback will forward those violating above mentioned assumption to the networking core, resulting in said misbehavior.(CVE-2022-3643)\n\nAn incorrect read request flaw was found in the Infrared Transceiver USB driver in the Linux kernel. This issue occurs when a user attaches a malicious USB device. A local user could use this flaw to starve the resources, causing denial of service or potentially crashing the system.(CVE-2022-3903)\n\nGuests can trigger deadlock in Linux netback driver T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] The patch for XSA-392 introduced another issue which might result in a deadlock when trying to free the SKB of a packet dropped due to the XSA-392 handling (CVE-2022-42328). Additionally when dropping packages for other reasons the same deadlock could occur in case of netpoll being active for the interface the xen-netback driver is connected to
