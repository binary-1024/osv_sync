The out-of-bounds write can cause a memory corruption which can have various consequences including a Denial of Service or Execution of attacker-supplied code.\n\nAlthough the consequences of a successful exploit of this vulnerability could be severe, the probability that the attacker would be able to perform it is low. Besides, password based (PWRI) encryption support in CMS messages is very rarely used. For that reason the issue was assessed as Moderate severity according to our Security Policy.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue, as the CMS implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.(CVE-2025-9230)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"openssl","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/openssl&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.1.1wa-13.oe2203sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["openssl-1.1.1wa-13.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","openssl-debuginfo-1.1.1wa-13.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","openssl-debugsource-1.1.1wa-13.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","openssl-devel-1.1.1wa-13.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","openssl-libs-1.1.1wa-13.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","openssl-perl-1.1.1wa-13.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["openssl-help-1.1.1wa-13.oe2203sp4.noarch.rpm"],"src":["openssl-1.1.1wa-13.oe2203sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["openssl-1.1.1wa-13.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","openssl-debuginfo-1.1.1wa-13.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","openssl-debugsource-1.1.1wa-13.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","openssl-devel-1.1.1wa-13.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","openssl-libs-1.1.1wa-13.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","openssl-perl-1.1.1wa-13.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2487.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2487"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-9230"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
