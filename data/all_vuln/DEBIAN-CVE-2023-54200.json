The problem is that when a veth device is released, the veth release callback will also queue the peer netns device for removal.  Its possible that the peer netns is also slated for removal.  In this case, the device memory is already released before the pre_exit hook of the peer netns runs:  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in nf_hook_entry_head+0x1b8/0x1d0 Read of size 8 at addr ffff88812c0124f0 by task kworker/u8:1/45 Workqueue: netns cleanup_net Call Trace:  nf_hook_entry_head+0x1b8/0x1d0  __nf_unregister_net_hook+0x76/0x510  nft_netdev_unregister_hooks+0xa0/0x220  __nft_release_hook+0x184/0x490  nf_tables_pre_exit_net+0x12f/0x1b0  ..
