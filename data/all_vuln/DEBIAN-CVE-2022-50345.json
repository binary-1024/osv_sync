This works because there are no cases where an operation needs a large RPC Call message and a large RPC Reply at the same time.  Once an RPC Call has been received, svc_process() updates svc_rqst::rq_res to describe the part of rq_pages that can be used for constructing the Reply. This means that the send buffer (rq_res) shrinks when the received RPC record containing the RPC Call is large.  A client can force this shrinkage on TCP by sending a correctly- formed RPC Call header contained in an RPC record that is excessively large. The full maximum payload size cannot be constructed in that case.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.221-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.103-1","5.10.103-1~bpo10+1","5.10.106-1","5.10.113-1","5.10.120-1","5.10.120-1~bpo10+1","5.10.127-1","5.10.127-2","5.10.127-2~bpo10+1","5.10.136-1","5.10.140-1","5.10.148-1","5.10.149-1","5.10.149-2","5.10.158-1","5.10.158-2","5.10.162-1","5.10.178-1","5.10.178-2","5.10.178-3","5.10.179-1","5.10.179-2","5.10.179-3","5.10.179-4","5.10.179-5","5.10.191-1","5.10.197-1","5.10.205-1","5.10.205-2","5.10.209-1","5.10.209-2","5.10.216-1","5.10.218-1","5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1","5.10.92-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50345.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50345.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50345.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50345.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-50345"}]}
