An unprivileged user that is not yet in a corresponding mount namespace with ~/tmp mounted as a polyinstantiated dir can place a FIFO there, and a subsequent attempt to login as this user with `pam_namespace` configured will cause the `openat()` in `protect_dir()` to block the attempt, causing a local denial of service.(CVE-2024-22365)",
