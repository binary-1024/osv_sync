  "details": "The updated packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nIt was found that the GnuTLS implementation of HMAC-SHA-256 and\nHMAC-SHA-384 was vulnerable to a Lucky thirteen style attack. Remote\nattackers could use this flaw to conduct distinguishing attacks and\nplaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data\nusing crafted packets (CVE-2018-10844, CVE-2018-10845).\n\nA cache-based side channel in GnuTLS implementation that leads to plain\ntext recovery in cross-VM attack setting was found. An attacker could\nuse a combination of \"Just in Time\" Prime+probe attack in combination\nwith Lucky-13 attack to recover plain text using crafted packets\n(CVE-2018-10846).\n",
