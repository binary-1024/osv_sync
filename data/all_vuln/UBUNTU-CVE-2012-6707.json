NOTE: the approach to changing this may not be fully compatible with certain use cases, such as migration of a WordPress site from a web host that uses a recent PHP version to a different web host that uses PHP 5.2. These use cases are plausible (but very unlikely) based on statistics showing widespread deployment of WordPress with obsolete PHP versions.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wordpress","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/wordpress@4.4.2+dfsg-1ubuntu1?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.3+dfsg-1","4.3.1+dfsg-1","4.4+dfsg-1","4.4.1+dfsg-1","4.4.2+dfsg-1","4.4.2+dfsg-1ubuntu1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"wordpress","binary_version":"4.4.2+dfsg-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-l10n","binary_version":"4.4.2+dfsg-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-theme-twentyfifteen","binary_version":"4.4.2+dfsg-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-theme-twentyfourteen","binary_version":"4.4.2+dfsg-1ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"wordpress-theme-twentysixteen","binary_version":"4.4.2+dfsg-1ubuntu1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2012/UBUNTU-CVE-2012-6707.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2012-6707"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21022"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-6707"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"low"}]}
