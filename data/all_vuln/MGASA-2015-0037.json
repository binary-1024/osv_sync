  "details": "Updated java-1.7.0 packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nA flaw was found in the way the Hotspot component in OpenJDK verified\nbytecode from the class files. An untrusted Java application or applet\ncould possibly use this flaw to bypass Java sandbox restrictions\n(CVE-2014-6601).\n\nMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the JAX-WS,\nand RMI components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet\ncould use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions (CVE-2015-0412,\nCVE-2015-0408).\n\nA flaw was found in the way the Hotspot garbage collector handled phantom\nreferences. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to\ncorrupt the Java Virtual Machine memory and, possibly, execute arbitrary\ncode, bypassing Java sandbox restrictions (CVE-2015-0395).\n\nA flaw was found in the way the DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) decoder\nin the Security component in OpenJDK handled negative length values. A\nspecially crafted, DER-encoded input could cause a Java application to\nenter an infinite loop when decoded (CVE-2015-0410).\n\nIt was discovered that the SSL/TLS implementation in the JSSE component in\nOpenJDK failed to properly check whether the ChangeCipherSpec was received\nduring the SSL/TLS connection handshake. An MITM attacker could possibly\nuse this flaw to force a connection to be established without encryption\nbeing enabled (CVE-2014-6593).\n\nAn information leak flaw was found in the Swing component in OpenJDK. An\nuntrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass certain\nJava sandbox restrictions (CVE-2015-0407).\n\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the MulticastSocket\nimplementation in the Libraries component of OpenJDK. An untrusted Java\napplication or applet could possibly use this flaw to bypass certain Java\nsandbox restrictions (CVE-2014-6587).\n\nMultiple boundary check flaws were found in the font parsing code in the 2D\ncomponent in OpenJDK. A specially crafted font file could allow an\nuntrusted Java application or applet to disclose portions of the Java\nVirtual Machine memory (CVE-2014-6585, CVE-2014-6591).\n\nMultiple insecure temporary file use issues were found in the way the\nHotspot component in OpenJDK created performance statistics and error log\nfiles. A local attacker could possibly make a victim using OpenJDK\noverwrite arbitrary files using a symlink attack (CVE-2015-0383).\n\nNote: This update disables SSL 3.0 by default to mitigate the POODLE issue,\nalso known as CVE-2014-3566. The jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms security\nproperty can be used to re-enable SSL 3.0 support if needed. For additional\ninformation, refer to the Red Hat Bugzilla bug linked to in the References\nsection.\n",
