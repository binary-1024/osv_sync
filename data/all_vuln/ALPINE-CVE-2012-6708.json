{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2012-6708","published":"2018-01-18T23:29:00.213Z","modified":"2025-11-19T05:57:47.386936Z","upstream":["CVE-2012-6708"],"details":"jQuery before 1.9.0 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The jQuery(strInput) function does not differentiate selectors from HTML in a reliable fashion. In vulnerable versions, jQuery determined whether the input was HTML by looking for the '<' character anywhere in the string, giving attackers more flexibility when attempting to construct a malicious payload. In fixed versions, jQuery only deems the input to be HTML if it explicitly starts with the '<' character, limiting exploitability only to attackers who can control the beginning of a string, which is far less common.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ruby","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/ruby?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.5.6-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.8.7_p160-r2","1.8.7_p160-r3","1.8.7_p174-r0","1.8.7_p174-r1","1.8.7_p174-r2","1.8.7_p174-r3","1.8.7_p174-r4","1.8.7_p174-r6","1.8.7_p174-r7","1.8.7_p299-r0","1.8.7_p299-r1","1.8.7_p299-r2","1.8.7_p352-r0","1.8.7_p352-r1","1.8.7_p358-r1","1.8.7_p72-r1","1.8.7_p72-r2","1.9.3_p194-r0","1.9.3_p286-r0","1.9.3_p286-r1","1.9.3_p286-r2","1.9.3_p327-r0","1.9.3_p362-r0","1.9.3_p374-r0","1.9.3_p385-r0","1.9.3_p392-r0","2.0.0_p0-r0","2.0.0_p0-r1","2.0.0_p195-r0","2.0.0_p247-r0","2.0.0_p247-r1","2.0.0_p247-r2","2.0.0_p247-r3","2.0.0_p353-r0","2.0.0_p353-r1","2.0.0_p353-r2","2.0.0_p481-r0","2.1.5-r0","2.1.5-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.2.2-r0","2.2.2-r1","2.2.3-r0","2.2.3-r1","2.2.4-r0","2.3.1-r0","2.3.1-r1","2.3.1-r2","2.3.2-r0","2.3.3-r0","2.3.3-r1","2.3.3-r2","2.3.3-r3","2.4.0-r3","2.4.1-r1","2.4.1-r2","2.4.1-r3","2.4.1-r4","2.4.1-r5","2.4.2-r0","2.4.2-r1","2.4.3-r0","2.5.0-r0","2.5.0-r1","2.5.1-r0","2.5.1-r1","2.5.1-r2","2.5.2-r0","2.5.3-r0","2.5.3-r1","2.5.3-r2","2.5.5-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2012-6708.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2012-6708"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
