  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  SUNRPC: Fix a slow server-side memory leak with RPC-over-TCP  Jan Schunk reports that his small NFS servers suffer from memory exhaustion after just a few days. A bisect shows that commit e18e157bb5c8 (\"SUNRPC: Send RPC message on TCP with a single sock_sendmsg() call\") is the first bad commit.  That commit assumed that sock_sendmsg() releases all the pages in the underlying bio_vec array, but the reality is that it doesn't. svc_xprt_release() releases the rqst's response pages, but the record marker page fragment isn't one of those, so it is never released.  This is a narrow fix that can be applied to stable kernels. A more extensive fix is in the works.",
