  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nof/fdt: run soc memory setup when early_init_dt_scan_memory fails\n\nIf memory has been found early_init_dt_scan_memory now returns 1. If\nit hasn't found any memory it will return 0, allowing other memory\nsetup mechanisms to carry on.\n\nPreviously early_init_dt_scan_memory always returned 0 without\ndistinguishing between any kind of memory setup being done or not. Any\ncode path after the early_init_dt_scan memory call in the ramips\nplat_mem_setup code wouldn't be executed anymore. Making\nearly_init_dt_scan_memory the only way to initialize the memory.\n\nSome boards, including my mt7621 based Cudy X6 board, depend on memory\ninitialization being done via the soc_info.mem_detect function\npointer. Those wouldn't be able to obtain memory and panic the kernel\nduring early bootup with the message \"early_init_dt_alloc_memory_arch:\nFailed to allocate 12416 bytes align=0x40\".",
