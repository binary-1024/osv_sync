A heap-based buffer overflow bug in svgpp_agg_render may lead to code execution. In the render_scanlines_aa_solid function, the blend_hline function is called repeatedly multiple times. blend_hline is equivalent to a loop containing write operations. Each call writes a piece of heap data, and multiple calls overwrite the data in the heap.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"svgpp","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/svgpp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.3.0+dfsg1-4","1.3.0+dfsg1-5","1.3.0+dfsg1-6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-6247.json"}},{"package":{"name":"svgpp","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/svgpp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.3.0+dfsg1-6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-6247.json"}},{"package":{"name":"svgpp","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/svgpp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.3.0+dfsg1-6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-6247.json"}},{"package":{"name":"svgpp","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/svgpp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.3.0+dfsg1-6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-6247.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-6247"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
