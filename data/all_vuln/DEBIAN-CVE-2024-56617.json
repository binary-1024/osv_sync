Commit    6539cffa9495 (\"cacheinfo: Add arch specific early level initializer\")  lets secondary CPUs correct (and reallocate memory) cacheinfo data if needed.  If the early build functionality is not used and cacheinfo does not need correction, memory for cacheinfo is never allocated. x86 does not use the early build functionality. Consequently, during the cacheinfo CPU hotplug callback, last_level_cache_is_valid() attempts to dereference a NULL pointer:    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000100   #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode   #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not present page   PGD 0 P4D 0   Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEPMT SMP NOPTI   CPU: 0 PID 19 Comm: cpuhp/0 Not tainted 6.4.0-rc2 #1   RIP: 0010: last_level_cache_is_valid+0x95/0xe0a  Allocate memory for cacheinfo during the cacheinfo CPU hotplug callback if not done earlier.  Moreover, before determining the validity of the last-level cache info, ensure that it has been allocated. Simply checking for non-zero cache_leaves() is not sufficient, as some architectures (e.g., Intel processors) have non-zero cache_leaves() before allocation.  Dereferencing NULL cacheinfo can occur in update_per_cpu_data_slice_size(). This function iterates over all online CPUs. However, a CPU may have come online recently, but its cacheinfo may not have been allocated yet.  While here, remove an unnecessary indentation in allocate_cache_info().
