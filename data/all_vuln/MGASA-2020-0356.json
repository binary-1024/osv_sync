  "details": "In HylaFAX+ through 7.0.2, the faxsetup utility calls chown on files in\nuser-owned directories. By winning a race, a local attacker could use this to\nescalate his privileges to root (CVE-2020-15396).\n\nHylaFAX+ through 7.0.2 has scripts that execute binaries from directories\nwritable by unprivileged users (e.g., locations under /var/spool/hylafax that\nare writable by the uucp account). This allows these users to execute code in\nthe context of the user calling these binaries (often root) (CVE-2020-15397).\n\nThe hylafax+ package has been updated to version 7.0.3, fixing thesee issues\nand several other bugs.\n",
