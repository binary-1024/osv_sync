Prior to version 1.2.0, a memory leak can be triggered when parsing usernames which can trigger a denial-of-service. The domain portion of a username may be overridden causing an allocated memory area the size of the domain name to be leaked. An attacker can leak memory via the main `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point, potentially causing a denial-of-service. This issue is fixed in version 1.2.0.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gss-ntlmssp","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gss-ntlmssp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-25566.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gss-ntlmssp","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gss-ntlmssp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-25566.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gss-ntlmssp","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gss-ntlmssp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-25566.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-25566"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
