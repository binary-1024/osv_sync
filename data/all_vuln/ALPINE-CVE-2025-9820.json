{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2025-9820","published":"2026-01-26T20:16:09.370Z","modified":"2026-01-27T11:15:46.622239Z","details":"A flaw was found in the GnuTLS library, specifically in the gnutls_pkcs11_token_init() function that handles PKCS#11 token initialization. When a token label longer than expected is processed, the function writes past the end of a fixed-size stack buffer. This programming error can cause the application using GnuTLS to crash or, in certain conditions, be exploited for code execution. As a result, systems or applications relying on GnuTLS may be vulnerable to a denial of service or local privilege escalation attacks.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gnutls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.23","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gnutls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.8.11-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.10.4-r0","2.10.5-r0","2.10.5-r1","2.10.5-r2","2.12.16-r0","2.12.6.1-r0","2.12.7-r0","2.6.4-r0","2.6.5-r0","2.6.6-r0","2.8.1-r0","2.8.1-r1","2.8.3-r0","2.8.5-r0","2.8.5-r1","2.8.6-r0","2.8.6-r1","2.8.6-r2","2.8.6-r3","3.0.17-r0","3.0.18-r0","3.0.19-r0","3.0.20-r0","3.0.21-r0","3.0.22-r0","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.10-r0","3.1.11-r0","3.1.2-r0","3.1.3-r0","3.1.4-r0","3.1.5-r0","3.1.5-r1","3.1.6-r1","3.1.7-r1","3.1.8-r1","3.1.9-r0","3.2.1-r0","3.2.1-r1","3.2.10-r0","3.2.11-r0","3.2.12-r0","3.2.12.1-r0","3.2.2-r1","3.2.3-r0","3.2.4-r0","3.2.4-r1","3.2.5-r0","3.2.6-r0","3.2.7-r0","3.2.8-r0","3.2.9-r0","3.3.1-r0","3.3.10-r0","3.3.11-r0","3.3.12-r0","3.3.13-r0","3.3.14-r0","3.3.2-r0","3.3.4-r0","3.3.5-r0","3.3.6-r0","3.3.7-r0","3.3.7-r1","3.3.8-r0","3.3.9-r0","3.3.9-r1","3.4.0-r0","3.4.1-r0","3.4.1-r1","3.4.10-r0","3.4.11-r0","3.4.13-r0","3.4.14-r0","3.4.14-r1","3.4.15-r0","3.4.16-r0","3.4.17-r0","3.4.2-r0","3.4.3-r0","3.4.4.1-r0","3.4.5-r0","3.4.6-r0","3.4.7-r0","3.4.8-r0","3.4.9-r0","3.5.10-r0","3.5.11-r0","3.5.12-r0","3.5.13-r0","3.5.13-r1","3.5.15-r0","3.5.8-r0","3.5.8-r1","3.5.9-r0","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.10-r0","3.6.11.1-r0","3.6.11.1-r1","3.6.12-r0","3.6.13-r0","3.6.13-r1","3.6.13-r2","3.6.14-r0","3.6.15-r0","3.6.15-r1","3.6.2-r0","3.6.4-r0","3.6.5-r0","3.6.6-r0","3.6.7-r0","3.6.8-r0","3.6.8-r1","3.6.9-r0","3.7.0-r0","3.7.1-r0","3.7.3-r0","3.7.4-r0","3.7.5-r0","3.7.6-r0","3.7.7-r0","3.7.7-r1","3.7.8-r0","3.7.8-r1","3.7.8-r2","3.8.0-r0","3.8.0-r1","3.8.0-r2","3.8.0-r3","3.8.0-r4","3.8.1-r0","3.8.10-r0","3.8.3-r0","3.8.5-r0","3.8.8-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-9820.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2025-9820"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
