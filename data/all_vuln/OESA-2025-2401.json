The latest version of the TIFF specification is available on-line in several different formats.And contains command-line programs for manipulating TIFF format image files using the libtiff library.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability classified as critical has been found in LibTIFF (Image Processing Software) (unknown version).CWE is classifying the issue as CWE-123. Any condition where the attacker has the ability to write an arbitrary value to an arbitrary location, often as the result of a buffer overflow.This is going to have an impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.There is no information about possible countermeasures known. It may be suggested to replace the affected object with an alternative product.(CVE-2025-9900)",
