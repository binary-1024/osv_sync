A Gem publisher can cause a Remote DoS when publishing a Gem. This is due to how Ruby reads the Manifest of Gem files when using Gem::Specification.from_yaml. from_yaml makes use of SafeYAML.load which allows YAML aliases inside the YAML-based metadata of a gem. YAML aliases allow for Denial of Service attacks with so-called `YAML-bombs` (comparable to Billion laughs attacks). This was patched. There is is no action required by users. This issue is also tracked as GHSL-2024-001 and was discovered by the GitHub security lab.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-35221.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2024-04-12"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/security/advisories/GHSA-4vc5-whwr-7hh2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/7cf74a2ff28b1b4c26e367d0d67521f7e1fed239/lib/rubygems/safe_yaml.rb#L28"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
