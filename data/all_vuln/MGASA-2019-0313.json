  "details": "Updated libxslt package fixes security vulnerabilities:\n\n* In numbers.c in libxslt 1.1.33, an xsl:number with certain format strings\n  could lead to a uninitialized read in xsltNumberFormatInsertNumbers. This\n  could allow an attacker to discern whether a byte on the stack contains\n  the characters A, a, I, i, or 0, or any other character (CVE-2019-13117).\n\n* In numbers.c in libxslt 1.1.33, a type holding grouping characters of an\n  xsl:number instruction was too narrow and an invalid character/length\n  combination could be passed to xsltNumberFormatDecimal, leading to a read\n  of uninitialized stack data (CVE-2019-13118).\n\n* In xsltCopyText in transform.c in libxslt 1.1.33, a pointer variable isn't\n  reset under certain circumstances. If the relevant memory area happened to\n  be freed and reused in a certain way, a bounds check could fail and memory\n  outside a buffer could be written to, or uninitialized data could be\n  disclosed (CVE-2019-18197).\n",
