The Archery project contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases. Affected versions are subject to SQL injection in the `data_dictionary.py` `table_info`. User input coming from the `db_name` in and the `tb_name` parameter values in the `sql/data_dictionary.py` `table_info` endpoint is passed to the following methods in the given SQL engine implementations, which concatenate user input unsafely into a SQL query and afterwards pass it to the `query` method of each database engine for execution.The methods are `get_table_meta_data ` in `sql/engines/mssql.py` which passes unsafe user input to the `sql/engines/mssql.py` `query` method, `get_table_desc_data` in `sql/engines/mssql.py`which passes unsafe user input to the `sql/engines/mssql.py` `query`, `get_table_index_data` in `sql/engines/mssql.py`which passes unsafe user input to the `sql/engines/mssql.py` `query` method, `get_table_meta_data` in `sql/engines/oracle.py`which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/oracle.py` `query` method, `get_table_desc_data` in `sql/engines/oracle.py`which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/oracle.py` `query` method, and `get_table_index_data` in `sql/engines/oracle.py` which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/oracle.py` `query` method. Each of these issues may be mitigated by escaping user input or by using prepared statements when executing SQL queries. This issue is also indexed as `GHSL-2022-106`.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-30557.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/blob/bc86cda4c3b7d59f759d0d23bb63a54f52616752/sql/data_dictionary.py#L47-L86"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/security/advisories/GHSA-9pvw-f8jv-xxjr"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-89"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
