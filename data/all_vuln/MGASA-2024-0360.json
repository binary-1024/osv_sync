  "details": "When curl is asked to use HSTS, the expiry time for a subdomain might\noverwrite a parent domain's cache entry, making it end sooner or later\nthan otherwise intended. This affects curl using applications that\nenable HSTS and use URLs with the insecure HTTP:// scheme and perform\ntransfers with hosts like x.example.com as well as example.com where the\nfirst host is a subdomain of the second host. This flaw also affects the\ncurl command line tool.\nWhen triggered, this is a potential minor DoS security problem when\ntrying to use HTTPS when that no longer works or a cleartext\ntransmission of data that was otherwise intended to possibly be\nprotected.\nThis update fixes the issue so subdomains cannot affect the HSTS cache\nof a parent domain.\n",
