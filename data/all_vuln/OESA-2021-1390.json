It is minimalistic because it just adds minimal support for the protocol, but at the same time it uses a high level printf-alike API in order to make it much higher level than otherwise suggested by its minimal code base and the lack of explicit bindings for every Redis command.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nHiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database. In affected versions Hiredis is vulnurable to integer overflow if provided maliciously crafted or corrupted `RESP` `mult-bulk` protocol data. When parsing `multi-bulk` (array-like) replies, hiredis fails to check if `count * sizeof(redisReply*)` can be represented in `SIZE_MAX`. If it can not, and the `calloc()` call doesn&apos;t itself make this check, it would result in a short allocation and subsequent buffer overflow. Users of hiredis who are unable to update may set the [maxelements](https://github.com/redis/hiredis#reader-max-array-elements) context option to a value small enough that no overflow is possible.(CVE-2021-32765)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"hiredis","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/hiredis&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.2-1.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["hiredis-debuginfo-1.0.2-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","hiredis-devel-1.0.2-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","hiredis-debugsource-1.0.2-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","hiredis-1.0.2-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["hiredis-1.0.2-1.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["hiredis-1.0.2-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","hiredis-devel-1.0.2-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","hiredis-debuginfo-1.0.2-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","hiredis-debugsource-1.0.2-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1390.json"}},{"package":{"name":"hiredis","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/hiredis&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.2-1.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["hiredis-1.0.2-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","hiredis-debugsource-1.0.2-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","hiredis-devel-1.0.2-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","hiredis-debuginfo-1.0.2-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["hiredis-1.0.2-1.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["hiredis-debugsource-1.0.2-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","hiredis-debuginfo-1.0.2-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","hiredis-devel-1.0.2-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","hiredis-1.0.2-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1390.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1390"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32765"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
