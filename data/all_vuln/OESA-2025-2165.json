  "details": "Binutils is a collection of binary utilities, including ar (for creating, modifying and extracting from archives), as (a family of GNU assemblers), gprof (for displaying call graph profile data), ld (the GNU linker), nm (for listing symbols from object files), objcopy (for copying and translating object files), objdump (for displaying information from object files), ranlib (for generating an index for the contents of an archive), readelf (for displaying detailed information about binary files), size (for listing the section sizes of an object or archive file), strings (for listing printable strings from files), strip (for discarding symbols), and addr2line (for converting addresses to file and line).\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability classified as problematic was found in GNU Binutils 2.45. Affected by this vulnerability is the function copy_section of the file binutils/objcopy.c. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The patch is named 08c3cbe5926e4d355b5cb70bbec2b1eeb40c2944. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.(CVE-2025-7545)",
