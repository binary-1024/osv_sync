An attacker may introduce characters through HTTP/2 pseudo-headers that are invalid in the context of an HTTP/1 request line, causing the Varnish server to produce invalid HTTP/1 requests to the backend. This could, in turn, be used to exploit vulnerabilities in a server behind the Varnish server. Note: the 6.0.x LTS series (before 6.0.11) is affected.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"varnish","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/varnish?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.2.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.1.5-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.0-r2","3.0.2-r0","3.0.2-r1","3.0.2-r2","3.0.2-r3","3.0.2-r4","3.0.2-r5","3.0.2-r6","3.0.2-r7","3.0.3-r0","3.0.3-r1","3.0.3-r2","3.0.4-r0","3.0.4-r1","3.0.4-r2","3.0.4-r3","3.0.4-r4","3.0.5-r0","3.0.5-r1","4.0.0-r0","4.0.0-r1","4.0.0-r2","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.2-r2","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.1.0-r0","4.1.0-r1","4.1.0-r2","4.1.1-r0","4.1.2-r0","4.1.2-r1","4.1.2-r2","4.1.2-r3","4.1.3-r0","5.1.2-r0","5.1.2-r1","5.1.3-r0","5.2.0-r0","5.2.1-r0","6.0.0-r0","6.0.0-r1","6.0.1-r0","6.1.0-r0","6.1.1-r0","6.2.0-r0","6.2.0-r1","6.2.1-r0","6.3.0-r0","6.3.1-r0","6.3.1-r1","6.3.2-r0","6.4.0-r0","6.5.1-r0","6.6.0-r0","6.6.1-r0","6.6.1-r1","7.0.0-r0","7.0.1-r0","7.0.1-r1","7.0.2-r0","7.1.0-r0","7.1.1-r0","7.2.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-45060.json"}},{"package":{"name":"varnish","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/varnish?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.2.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.1.5-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.0-r2","3.0.2-r0","3.0.2-r1","3.0.2-r2","3.0.2-r3","3.0.2-r4","3.0.2-r5","3.0.2-r6","3.0.2-r7","3.0.3-r0","3.0.3-r1","3.0.3-r2","3.0.4-r0","3.0.4-r1","3.0.4-r2","3.0.4-r3","3.0.4-r4","3.0.5-r0","3.0.5-r1","4.0.0-r0","4.0.0-r1","4.0.0-r2","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.2-r2","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.1.0-r0","4.1.0-r1","4.1.0-r2","4.1.1-r0","4.1.2-r0","4.1.2-r1","4.1.2-r2","4.1.2-r3","4.1.3-r0","5.1.2-r0","5.1.2-r1","5.1.3-r0","5.2.0-r0","5.2.1-r0","6.0.0-r0","6.0.0-r1","6.0.1-r0","6.1.0-r0","6.1.1-r0","6.2.0-r0","6.2.0-r1","6.2.1-r0","6.3.0-r0","6.3.1-r0","6.3.1-r1","6.3.2-r0","6.4.0-r0","6.5.1-r0","6.6.0-r0","6.6.1-r0","6.6.1-r1","7.0.0-r0","7.0.1-r0","7.0.1-r1","7.0.2-r0","7.1.0-r0","7.1.1-r0","7.2.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-45060.json"}},{"package":{"name":"varnish","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/varnish?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.2.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.1.5-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.0-r2","3.0.2-r0","3.0.2-r1","3.0.2-r2","3.0.2-r3","3.0.2-r4","3.0.2-r5","3.0.2-r6","3.0.2-r7","3.0.3-r0","3.0.3-r1","3.0.3-r2","3.0.4-r0","3.0.4-r1","3.0.4-r2","3.0.4-r3","3.0.4-r4","3.0.5-r0","3.0.5-r1","4.0.0-r0","4.0.0-r1","4.0.0-r2","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.2-r2","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.1.0-r0","4.1.0-r1","4.1.0-r2","4.1.1-r0","4.1.2-r0","4.1.2-r1","4.1.2-r2","4.1.2-r3","4.1.3-r0","5.1.2-r0","5.1.2-r1","5.1.3-r0","5.2.0-r0","5.2.1-r0","6.0.0-r0","6.0.0-r1","6.0.1-r0","6.1.0-r0","6.1.1-r0","6.2.0-r0","6.2.0-r1","6.2.1-r0","6.3.0-r0","6.3.1-r0","6.3.1-r1","6.3.2-r0","6.4.0-r0","6.5.1-r0","6.6.0-r0","6.6.1-r0","6.6.1-r1","7.0.0-r0","7.0.1-r0","7.0.1-r1","7.0.2-r0","7.1.0-r0","7.1.1-r0","7.2.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-45060.json"}},{"package":{"name":"varnish","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/varnish?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.2.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.1.5-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.0-r2","3.0.2-r0","3.0.2-r1","3.0.2-r2","3.0.2-r3","3.0.2-r4","3.0.2-r5","3.0.2-r6","3.0.2-r7","3.0.3-r0","3.0.3-r1","3.0.3-r2","3.0.4-r0","3.0.4-r1","3.0.4-r2","3.0.4-r3","3.0.4-r4","3.0.5-r0","3.0.5-r1","4.0.0-r0","4.0.0-r1","4.0.0-r2","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.2-r2","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.1.0-r0","4.1.0-r1","4.1.0-r2","4.1.1-r0","4.1.2-r0","4.1.2-r1","4.1.2-r2","4.1.2-r3","4.1.3-r0","5.1.2-r0","5.1.2-r1","5.1.3-r0","5.2.0-r0","5.2.1-r0","6.0.0-r0","6.0.0-r1","6.0.1-r0","6.1.0-r0","6.1.1-r0","6.2.0-r0","6.2.0-r1","6.2.1-r0","6.3.0-r0","6.3.1-r0","6.3.1-r1","6.3.2-r0","6.4.0-r0","6.5.1-r0","6.6.0-r0","6.6.1-r0","6.6.1-r1","7.0.0-r0","7.0.1-r0","7.0.1-r1","7.0.2-r0","7.1.0-r0","7.1.1-r0","7.2.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-45060.json"}},{"package":{"name":"varnish","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/varnish?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.2.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.1.5-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.0-r2","3.0.2-r0","3.0.2-r1","3.0.2-r2","3.0.2-r3","3.0.2-r4","3.0.2-r5","3.0.2-r6","3.0.2-r7","3.0.3-r0","3.0.3-r1","3.0.3-r2","3.0.4-r0","3.0.4-r1","3.0.4-r2","3.0.4-r3","3.0.4-r4","3.0.5-r0","3.0.5-r1","4.0.0-r0","4.0.0-r1","4.0.0-r2","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.2-r2","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.1.0-r0","4.1.0-r1","4.1.0-r2","4.1.1-r0","4.1.2-r0","4.1.2-r1","4.1.2-r2","4.1.2-r3","4.1.3-r0","5.1.2-r0","5.1.2-r1","5.1.3-r0","5.2.0-r0","
