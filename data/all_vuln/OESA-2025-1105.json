BIND includes a DNS server (named), which resolves host names to IP addresses; a resolver library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating properly.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nIt is possible to construct a zone such that some queries to it will generate responses containing numerous records in the Additional section. An attacker sending many such queries can cause either the authoritative server itself or an independent resolver to use disproportionate resources processing the queries. Zones will usually need to have been deliberately crafted to attack this exposure.\nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.11.0 through 9.11.37, 9.16.0 through 9.16.50, 9.18.0 through 9.18.32, 9.20.0 through 9.20.4, 9.21.0 through 9.21.3, 9.11.3-S1 through 9.11.37-S1, 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.50-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.32-S1.(CVE-2024-11187)\n\nClients using DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) can exhaust a DNS resolver&apos;s CPU and/or memory by flooding it with crafted valid or invalid HTTP/2 traffic.\nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.18.0 through 9.18.32, 9.20.0 through 9.20.4, 9.21.0 through 9.21.3, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.32-S1.(CVE-2024-12705)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"bind","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/bind&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.18.21-4.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["bind-9.18.21-4.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","bind-chroot-9.18.21-4.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","bind-debuginfo-9.18.21-4.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","bind-debugsource-9.18.21-4.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","bind-devel-9.18.21-4.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","bind-dnssec-utils-9.18.21-4.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","bind-libs-9.18.21-4.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","bind-utils-9.18.21-4.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["bind-dnssec-doc-9.18.21-4.oe2403.noarch.rpm","bind-license-9.18.21-4.oe2403.noarch.rpm"],"src":["bind-9.18.21-4.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["bind-9.18.21-4.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","bind-chroot-9.18.21-4.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","bind-debuginfo-9.18.21-4.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","bind-debugsource-9.18.21-4.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","bind-devel-9.18.21-4.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","bind-dnssec-utils-9.18.21-4.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","bind-libs-9.18.21-4.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","bind-utils-9.18.21-4.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1105.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-1105"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-11187"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-12705"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
