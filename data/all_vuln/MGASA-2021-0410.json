  "details": "This kernel-linus update is based on upstream 5.10.60 and fixes at least\nthe following security issues:\n\nA missing validation of the \"int_ctl\" VMCB field allows a malicious L1\nguest to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller)\nfor the L2 guest. The L2 guest is able to write to a limited but still\nrelatively large subset of the host physical memory, resulting in a\ncrash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential\nguest-to-host escape (CVE-2021-3653).\n\nA missing validation of the the \"virt_ext\" VMCB field and allows a\nmalicious L1 guest to disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS\n(Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest. Under these circumstances,\nthe L2 guest is able to run VMLOAD/VMSAVE unintercepted, and thus\nread/write portions of the host physical memory, resulting in a\ncrash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential\nguest-to-host escape (CVE-2021-3656).\n\nIn kernel/bpf/hashtab.c in the Linux kernel through 5.13.8, there is\nan integer overflow and out-of-bounds write when many elements are\nplaced in a single bucket (CVE-2021-38166).\n\ndrivers/net/ethernet/xilinx/xilinx_emaclite.c in the Linux kernel before\n5.13.3 makes it easier for attackers to defeat an ASLR protection\nmechanism because it prints a kernel pointer (CVE-2021-38205).\n\nFor other upstream fixes, see the referenced changelogs.\n",
