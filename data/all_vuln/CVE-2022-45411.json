To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> and XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-Method-Override</code> that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again. Thunderbird has applied the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.","references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1790311"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2022-47/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2022-48/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2022-49/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
