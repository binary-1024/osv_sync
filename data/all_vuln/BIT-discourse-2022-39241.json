A malicious admin could use this vulnerability to perform port enumeration on the local host or other hosts on the internal network, as well as against hosts on the Internet. Latest `stable`, `beta`, and `test-passed` versions are now patched. As a workaround, self-hosters can use `DISCOURSE_BLOCKED_IP_BLOCKS` env var (which overrides `blocked_ip_blocks` setting) to stop webhooks from accessing private IPs.",
