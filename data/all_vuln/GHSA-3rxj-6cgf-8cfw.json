This requires at least the ability to perform 4 separate requests on the same function and partial knowledge of how the serialized data is used during later runtime processing. \n\nThis vulnerability affects the `fromJSON` and `fromCrossJSON` functions in a client-to-server transmission scenario.\n\nNo known workarounds or mitigations are known, so please upgrade to the patched version.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"seroval","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/seroval"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-3rxj-6cgf-8cfw/GHSA-3rxj-6cgf-8cfw.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/lxsmnsyc/seroval/security/advisories/GHSA-3rxj-6cgf-8cfw"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23737"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/lxsmnsyc/seroval/commit/ce9408ebc87312fcad345a73c172212f2a798060"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/lxsmnsyc/seroval"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-502"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-21T15:41:22Z","nvd_published_at":"2026-01-21T23:15:52Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
