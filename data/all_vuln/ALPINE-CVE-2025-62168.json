{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2025-62168","published":"2025-10-17T17:15:49.037Z","modified":"2025-12-03T23:03:50.414029Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-62168"],"details":"Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. In Squid versions prior to 7.2, a failure to redact HTTP authentication credentials in error handling allows information disclosure. The vulnerability allows a script to bypass browser security protections and learn the credentials a trusted client uses to authenticate. This potentially allows a remote client to identify security tokens or credentials used internally by a web application using Squid for backend load balancing. These attacks do not require Squid to be configured with HTTP authentication. The vulnerability is fixed in version 7.2. As a workaround, disable debug information in administrator mailto links generated by Squid by configuring squid.conf with email_err_data off.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"squid","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.23","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/squid?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.7.6-r0","2.7.6-r1","2.7.6-r10","2.7.6-r11","2.7.6-r12","2.7.6-r2","2.7.6-r3","2.7.6-r4","2.7.6-r5","2.7.6-r6","2.7.6-r7","2.7.6-r8","2.7.6-r9","2.7.7-r0","2.7.7-r1","2.7.7-r2","2.7.7-r3","2.7.7-r4","2.7.7-r5","2.7.9-r0","2.7.9-r1","2.7.9-r2","2.7.9-r3","2.7.9-r4","3.2.0.12-r1","3.2.0.12-r2","3.2.0.12-r3","3.2.0.12-r4","3.2.0.13-r0","3.2.0.16-r0","3.2.0.17-r0","3.2.0.17-r1","3.2.0.17-r2","3.2.0.18-r0","3.2.0.18-r1","3.2.0.19-r0","3.2.0.19-r1","3.2.2-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.4-r0","3.2.5-r0","3.2.6-r0","3.2.6-r1","3.2.7-r1","3.2.7-r2","3.3.10-r0","3.3.11-r0","3.3.11-r1","3.3.2-r0","3.3.3-r0","3.3.4-r0","3.3.5-r0","3.3.6-r0","3.3.7-r0","3.3.8-r0","3.3.8-r1","3.3.9-r0","3.4.10-r0","3.4.11-r0","3.4.12-r0","3.4.5-r0","3.4.6-r0","3.4.6-r1","3.4.7-r0","3.4.8-r0","3.4.9-r0","3.5.10-r0","3.5.11-r0","3.5.12-r0","3.5.13-r0","3.5.14-r0","3.5.14-r1","3.5.15-r0","3.5.15-r1","3.5.16-r0","3.5.17-r0","3.5.17-r1","3.5.19-r0","3.5.19-r1","3.5.2-r0","3.5.2-r1","3.5.20-r0","3.5.20-r1","3.5.20-r2","3.5.22-r0","3.5.23-r0","3.5.23-r1","3.5.23-r2","3.5.23-r3","3.5.23-r4","3.5.27-r0","3.5.27-r1","3.5.27-r2","3.5.28-r0","3.5.3-r0","3.5.4-r0","3.5.4-r1","3.5.5-r0","3.5.6-r0","3.5.6-r1","3.5.7-r0","3.5.8-r0","4.10-r0","4.11-r0","4.12-r0","4.13-r0","4.2-r0","4.2-r1","4.4-r0","4.4-r1","4.6-r0","4.6-r1","4.8-r0","4.8-r1","4.9-r0","5.0.4-r0","5.0.4-r1","5.0.5-r0","5.0.6-r0","5.0.7-r0","5.0.7-r1","5.1-r0","5.1-r1","5.2-r0","5.3-r0","5.4-r0","5.4.1-r0","5.5-r0","5.6-r0","5.6-r1","5.6-r2","5.6-r3","5.7-r0","5.7-r1","5.9-r0","5.9-r1","6.1-r0","6.10-r0","6.10-r1","6.11-r0","6.12-r0","6.12-r1","6.2-r0","6.2-r1","6.3-r0","6.4-r0","6.5-r0","6.6-r0","6.6-r1","6.6-r2","6.7-r0","6.8-r0","6.9-r0","6.9-r1","7.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-62168.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2025-62168"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
