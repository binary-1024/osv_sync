  "details": "Starting in Python 3.12.0, the asyncio._SelectorSocketTransport.writelines()  method would not \"pause\" writing and signal to the Protocol to drain  the buffer to the wire once the write buffer reached the \"high-water  mark\". Because of this, Protocols would not periodically drain the write  buffer potentially leading to memory exhaustion.      This  vulnerability likely impacts a small number of users, you must be using  Python 3.12.0 or later, on macOS or Linux, using the asyncio module  with protocols, and using .writelines() method which had new  zero-copy-on-write behavior in Python 3.12.0 and later. If not all of  these factors are true then your usage of Python is unaffected.",
