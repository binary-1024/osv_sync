In versions prior to 2.8.1the `github.com/sylabs/sif/v2/pkg/integrity` package did not verify that the hash algorithm(s) used are cryptographically secure when verifying digital signatures. A patch is available in version >= v2.8.1 of the module. Users are encouraged to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may independently validate that the hash algorithm(s) used for metadata digest(s) and signature hash are cryptographically secure.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"golang-github-sylabs-sif","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-sylabs-sif?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.9-2.1","2.15.0-1","2.15.1-1","2.15.2-1","2.16.0-1","2.16.0-2","2.17.0-1","2.18.0-1","2.19.1-1","2.19.2-1","2.20.0-1","2.20.0-2","2.20.2-1","2.21.0-1","2.3.1-1","2.3.1-2","2.3.1-3","2.8.3-1","2.8.3-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-39237.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-sylabs-sif","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-sylabs-sif?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.8.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-39237.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-sylabs-sif","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-sylabs-sif?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.8.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-39237.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-sylabs-sif","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-sylabs-sif?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.8.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-39237.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39237"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
