In some scenarios, it can run in IRQ context, which is not safe unless TIMER_IRQSAFE is used.  One potentially risky scenario was demonstrated in Intel DRM CI trybot, BAT run on machine bat-adlp-6, while working on new IGT subtests syncobj_timeline@stress-* as user space replacements of some problematic test cases of a dma-fence-chain selftest [1].
