Use a CPUHP_AP_ONLINE_DYN entry instead to execute the cpuhp cb later, with preemption enabled.  SDEI originally got its own cpuhp slot to allow interacting with perf. It got superseded by pNMI and this early slot is not relevant anymore. [1]  Some SDEI calls (e.g. SDEI_1_0_FN_SDEI_PE_MASK) take actions on the calling CPU. It is checked that preemption is disabled for them. _ONLINE cpuhp cb are executed in the 'per CPU hotplug thread'. Preemption is enabled in those threads, but their cpumask is limited to 1 CPU. Move 'WARN_ON_ONCE(preemptible())' statements so that SDEI cpuhp cb don't trigger them.  Also add a check for the SDEI_1_0_FN_SDEI_PRIVATE_RESET SDEI call which acts on the calling CPU.
