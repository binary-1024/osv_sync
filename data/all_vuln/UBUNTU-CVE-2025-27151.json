In versions starting from 7.0.0 to before 8.0.2, a stack-based buffer overflow exists in redis-check-aof due to the use of memcpy with strlen(filepath) when copying a user-supplied file path into a fixed-size stack buffer. This allows an attacker to overflow the stack and potentially achieve code execution. This issue has been patched in version 8.0.2.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"redis","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/redis@5:7.0.15-1ubuntu0.24.04.2?arch=source&distro=noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5:7.0.12-1","5:7.0.14-1","5:7.0.14-2","5:7.0.15-1","5:7.0.15-1build1","5:7.0.15-1build2","5:7.0.15-1ubuntu0.24.04.1","5:7.0.15-1ubuntu0.24.04.2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"redis","binary_version":"5:7.0.15-1ubuntu0.24.04.2"},{"binary_name":"redis-sentinel","binary_version":"5:7.0.15-1ubuntu0.24.04.2"},{"binary_name":"redis-server","binary_version":"5:7.0.15-1ubuntu0.24.04.2"},{"binary_name":"redis-tools","binary_version":"5:7.0.15-1ubuntu0.24.04.2"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-27151.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-27151"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-27151"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/commit/643b5db235cb82508e72f11c7b4bbfc7dc39be56"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/8.0.2"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-5453-q98w-cmvm"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
