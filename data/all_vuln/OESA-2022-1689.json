When using the default configuration of fish, changing to a directory automatically runs `git` commands in order to display information about the current repository in the prompt. If an attacker can convince a user to change their current directory into one controlled by the attacker, such as on a shared file system or extracted archive, fish will run arbitrary commands under the attacker&apos;s control. This problem has been fixed in fish 3.4.0. Note that running git in these directories, including using the git tab completion, remains a potential trigger for this issue. As a workaround, remove the `fish_git_prompt` function from the prompt.(CVE-2022-20001)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"fish","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/fish&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.3.1-2.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["fish-3.3.1-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","fish-debugsource-3.3.1-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","fish-debuginfo-3.3.1-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["fish-3.3.1-2.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["fish-debugsource-3.3.1-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","fish-debuginfo-3.3.1-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","fish-3.3.1-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1689.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fish","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/fish&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.3.1-2.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["fish-debuginfo-3.3.1-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","fish-3.3.1-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","fish-debugsource-3.3.1-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["fish-3.3.1-2.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["fish-3.3.1-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","fish-debugsource-3.3.1-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","fish-debuginfo-3.3.1-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1689.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fish","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/fish&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.3.1-4.oe2203"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["fish-3.3.1-4.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","fish-debuginfo-3.3.1-4.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","fish-debugsource-3.3.1-4.oe2203.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["fish-3.3.1-4.oe2203.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["fish-3.3.1-4.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","fish-debuginfo-3.3.1-4.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","fish-debugsource-3.3.1-4.oe2203.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1689.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2022-1689"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-20001"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
