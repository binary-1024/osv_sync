When the attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/python3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.8.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.1.3-r0","3.2.0-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.3.0-r0","3.3.2-r0","3.3.3-r0","3.3.4-r0","3.4.1-r0","3.4.2-r0","3.4.2-r1","3.4.3-r1","3.4.3-r2","3.5.0-r0","3.5.1-r0","3.5.1-r1","3.5.1-r2","3.5.1-r3","3.5.2-r0","3.5.2-r1","3.5.2-r10","3.5.2-r2","3.5.2-r3","3.5.2-r4","3.5.2-r5","3.5.2-r6","3.5.2-r7","3.5.2-r8","3.5.2-r9","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.1-r1","3.6.1-r2","3.6.1-r3","3.6.1-r4","3.6.2-r0","3.6.2-r1","3.6.2-r2","3.6.2-r3","3.6.3-r3","3.6.3-r4","3.6.3-r5","3.6.3-r6","3.6.3-r7","3.6.3-r8","3.6.3-r9","3.6.4-r0","3.6.4-r1","3.6.6-r0","3.6.6-r1","3.6.6-r2","3.6.6-r3","3.6.7-r0","3.6.8-r0","3.6.8-r1","3.6.8-r2","3.7.2-r0","3.7.3-r0","3.7.3-r1","3.7.4-r0","3.7.5-r0","3.7.5-r1","3.8.0-r0","3.8.1-r0","3.8.1-r1","3.8.1-r2","3.8.1-r3","3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.8.2-r5","3.8.2-r6","3.8.2-r7","3.8.3-r0","3.8.4-r0","3.8.5-r0","3.8.5-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-23336.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/python3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.8.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.1.3-r0","3.2.0-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.3.0-r0","3.3.2-r0","3.3.3-r0","3.3.4-r0","3.4.1-r0","3.4.2-r0","3.4.2-r1","3.4.3-r1","3.4.3-r2","3.5.0-r0","3.5.1-r0","3.5.1-r1","3.5.1-r2","3.5.1-r3","3.5.2-r0","3.5.2-r1","3.5.2-r10","3.5.2-r2","3.5.2-r3","3.5.2-r4","3.5.2-r5","3.5.2-r6","3.5.2-r7","3.5.2-r8","3.5.2-r9","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.1-r1","3.6.1-r2","3.6.1-r3","3.6.1-r4","3.6.2-r0","3.6.2-r1","3.6.2-r2","3.6.2-r3","3.6.3-r3","3.6.3-r4","3.6.3-r5","3.6.3-r6","3.6.3-r7","3.6.3-r8","3.6.3-r9","3.6.4-r0","3.6.4-r1","3.6.6-r0","3.6.6-r1","3.6.6-r2","3.6.6-r3","3.6.7-r0","3.6.8-r0","3.6.8-r1","3.6.8-r2","3.7.2-r0","3.7.3-r0","3.7.3-r1","3.7.4-r0","3.7.5-r0","3.7.5-r1","3.8.0-r0","3.8.1-r0","3.8.1-r1","3.8.1-r2","3.8.1-r3","3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.8.2-r5","3.8.2-r6","3.8.2-r7","3.8.3-r0","3.8.4-r0","3.8.5-r0","3.8.5-r1","3.8.5-r2","3.8.6-r0","3.8.7-r0","3.8.7-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-23336.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/python3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.8.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.1.3-r0","3.2.0-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.3.0-r0","3.3.2-r0","3.3.3-r0","3.3.4-r0","3.4.1-r0","3.4.2-r0","3.4.2-r1","3.4.3-r1","3.4.3-r2","3.5.0-r0","3.5.1-r0","3.5.1-r1","3.5.1-r2","3.5.1-r3","3.5.2-r0","3.5.2-r1","3.5.2-r10","3.5.2-r2","3.5.2-r3","3.5.2-r4","3.5.2-r5","3.5.2-r6","3.5.2-r7","3.5.2-r8","3.5.2-r9","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.1-r1","3.6.1-r2","3.6.1-r3","3.6.1-r4","3.6.2-r0","3.6.2-r1","3.6.2-r2","3.6.2-r3","3.6.3-r3","3.6.3-r4","3.6.3-r5","3.6.3-r6","3.6.3-r7","3.6.3-r8","3.6.3-r9","3.6.4-r0","3.6.4-r1","3.6.6-r0","3.6.6-r1","3.6.6-r2","3.6.6-r3","3.6.7-r0","3.6.8-r0","3.6.8-r1","3.6.8-r2","3.7.2-r0","3.7.3-r0","3.7.3-r1","3.7.4-r0","3.7.5-r0","3.7.5-r1","3.8.0-r0","3.8.1-r0","3.8.1-r1","3.8.1-r2","3.8.1-r3","3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.8.2-r5","3.8.2-r6","3.8.2-r7","3.8.3-r0","3.8.4-r0","3.8.5-r0","3.8.5-r1","3.8.5-r2","3.8.6-r0","3.8.7-r0","3.8.7-r1","3.8.7-r2","3.8.7-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-23336.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/python3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.8.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.1.3-r0","3.2.0-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.3.0-r0","3.3.2-r0","3.3.3-r0","3.3.4-r0","3.4.1-r0","3.4.2-r0","3.4.2-r1","3.4.3-r1","3.4.3-r2","3.5.0-r0","3.5.1-r0","3.5.1-r1","3.5.1-r2","3.5.1-r3","3.5.2-r0","3.5.2-r1","3.5.2-r10","3.5.2-r2","3.5.2-r3","3.5.2-r4","3.5.2-r5","3.5.2-r6","3.5.2-r7","3.5.2-r8","3.5.2-r9","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.1-r1","3.6.1-r2","3.6.1-r3","3.6.1-r4","3.6.2-r0","3.6.2-r1","3.6.2-r2","3.6.2-r3","3.6.3-r3","3.6.3-r4","3.6.3-r5","3.6.3-r6","3.6.3-r7","3.6.3-r8","3.6.3-r9","3.6.4-r0","3.6.4-r1","3.6.6-r0","3.6.6-r1","3.6.6-r2","3.6.6-r3","3.6.7-r0","3.6.8-r0","3.6.8-r1","3.6.8-r2","3.7.2-r0","3.7.3-r0","3.7.3-r1","3.7.4-r0","3.7.5-r0","3.7.5-r1","3.8.0-r0","3.8.1-r0","3.8.1-r1","3.8.1-r2","3.8.1-r3","3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.8.2-r5","3.8.2-r6","3.8.2-r7","3.8.3-r0","3.8.4-r0","3.8.5-r0","3.8.5-r1","3.8.5-r2","3.8.6-r0","3.8.7-r0","3.8.7-r1","3.8.7-r2","3.8.7-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-23336.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/python3?arch=source"},"ra
