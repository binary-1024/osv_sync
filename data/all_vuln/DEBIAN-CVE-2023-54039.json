{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-54039","published":"2025-12-24T11:15:56.890Z","modified":"2025-12-25T11:13:44.261136Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-54039"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: j1939: j1939_tp_tx_dat_new(): fix out-of-bounds memory access  In the j1939_tp_tx_dat_new() function, an out-of-bounds memory access could occur during the memcpy() operation if the size of skb->cb is larger than the size of struct j1939_sk_buff_cb. This is because the memcpy() operation uses the size of skb->cb, leading to a read beyond the struct j1939_sk_buff_cb.  Updated the memcpy() operation to use the size of struct j1939_sk_buff_cb instead of the size of skb->cb. This ensures that the memcpy() operation only reads the memory within the bounds of struct j1939_sk_buff_cb, preventing out-of-bounds memory access.  Additionally, add a BUILD_BUG_ON() to check that the size of skb->cb is greater than or equal to the size of struct j1939_sk_buff_cb. This ensures that the skb->cb buffer is large enough to hold the j1939_sk_buff_cb structure.
