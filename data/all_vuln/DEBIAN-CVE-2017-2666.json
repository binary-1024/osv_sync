This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests other than their own.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"undertow","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/undertow?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.18-1"}]}],"versions":["1.3.11-1","1.3.16-1","1.3.19-1","1.3.21-1","1.3.23-1","1.3.4-1","1.3.5-1","1.3.7-1","1.4.0-1","1.4.1-1","1.4.3-1","1.4.4-1","1.4.6-1","1.4.7-1","1.4.8-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2017-2666.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2666"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
