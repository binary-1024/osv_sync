When processing crafted or excessively large raw RF input data, the application may write beyond the bounds of a stack buffer, resulting in memory corruption or a crash. This vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service and, under certain conditions, may be leveraged for further exploitation depending on the execution environment and available mitigations.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"rtl-433","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/rtl-433?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["20.11-1","21.05-1","21.05-2","21.12+git20220718+ds-1","21.12+git20220718+ds-2","21.12-1","22.11+git20230213+ds-1","22.11-1","23.11-1","23.11-2","24.10-1","25.02-1","25.02-1.1","25.12-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-34450.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rtl-433","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/rtl-433?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["22.11+git20230213+ds-1","22.11-1","23.11-1","23.11-2","24.10-1","25.02-1","25.02-1.1","25.12-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-34450.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rtl-433","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/rtl-433?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["25.02-1","25.02-1.1","25.12-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-34450.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rtl-433","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/rtl-433?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"25.12-1"}]}],"versions":["25.02-1","25.02-1.1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-34450.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-34450"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
