  "details": "Updated firefox packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nMultiple memory safety issues in Firefox were discovered. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application\ncrash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking\nFirefox (CVE-2015-7201).\n\nRonald Crane discovered a buffer overflow through code inspection. If a\nuser were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker\ncould potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via\napplication crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser invoking Firefox (CVE-2015-7205).\n\nLooben Yang discovered a use-after-free in WebRTC when closing channels in\nsome circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially\ncrafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a\ndenial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with\nthe privileges of the user invoking Firefox (CVE-2015-7210).\n\nAbhishek Arya discovered an integer overflow when allocating large\ntextures. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of\nservice via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking Firefox (CVE-2015-7212).\n\nRonald Crane dicovered an integer overflow when processing MP4 format\nvideo in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\ncause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code\nwith the privileges of the user invoking Firefox (CVE-2015-7213).\n\nTsubasa Iinuma discovered a way to bypass same-origin restrictions using\ndata: and view-source: URLs. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\nobtain sensitive information and read local files (CVE-2015-7214).\n\nGerald Squelart discovered an integer underflow in the libstagefright\nlibrary when parsing MP4 format video in some circumstances. If a user\nwere tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application\ncrash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking\nFirefox (CVE-2015-7222).\n",
