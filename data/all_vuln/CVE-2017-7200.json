The 'copy_from' feature in the Image Service API v1 allowed an attacker to perform masked network port scans. With v1, it is possible to create images with a URL such as 'http://localhost:22'. This could then allow an attacker to enumerate internal network details while appearing masked, since the scan would appear to originate from the Glance Image service.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96988"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/+bug/1153614"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/+bug/1606495"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OSSN/OSSN-0078"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
