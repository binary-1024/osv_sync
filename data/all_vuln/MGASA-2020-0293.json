  "details": "Updated mbedtls packages fix security vulnerabilities\n\nFix a side channel vulnerability in modular exponentiation that could reveal\nan RSA private key used in a secure enclave.\n\nFix side channel in mbedtls_ecp_check_pub_priv() and mbedtls_pk_parse_key() /\nmbedtls_pk_parse_keyfile() (when loading a private key that didn't include the\nuncompressed public key), as well as mbedtls_ecp_mul() /\nmbedtls_ecp_mul_restartable() when called with a NULL f_rng argument. An\nattacker with access to precise enough timing and memory access information\n(typically an untrusted operating system attacking a secure enclave) could\nfully recover the ECC private key. \n\nFix issue in Lucky 13 counter-measure that could make it ineffective when\nhardware accelerators were used (using one of the MBEDTLS_SHAxxx_ALT macros).\nThis would cause the original Lucky 13 attack to be possible in those\nconfigurations, allowing an active network attacker to recover plaintext after\nrepeated timing measurements under some conditions.\n",
