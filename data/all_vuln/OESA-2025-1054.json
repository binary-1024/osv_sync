  "details": "Podman manages the entire container ecosystem which includes pods, containers, container images, and container volumes using the libpod library.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nSome HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a reset flood, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request over each stream that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both.(CVE-2019-9514)\r\n\r\nUncontrolled recursion in the Parse functions in go/parser before Go 1.17.12 and Go 1.18.4 allow an attacker to cause a panic due to stack exhaustion via deeply nested types or declarations.(CVE-2022-1962)\r\n\r\nRequests forwarded by ReverseProxy include the raw query parameters from the inbound request, including unparsable parameters rejected by net/http. This could permit query parameter smuggling when a Go proxy forwards a parameter with an unparsable value. After fix, ReverseProxy sanitizes the query parameters in the forwarded query when the outbound request&apos;s Form field is set after the ReverseProxy. Director function returns, indicating that the proxy has parsed the query parameters. Proxies which do not parse query parameters continue to forward the original query parameters unchanged.(CVE-2022-2880)\r\n\r\nA too-short encoded message can cause a panic in Float.GobDecode and Rat GobDecode in math/big in Go before 1.17.13 and 1.18.5, potentially allowing a denial of service.(CVE-2022-32189)\r\n\r\nPrograms which compile regular expressions from untrusted sources may be vulnerable to memory exhaustion or denial of service. The parsed regexp representation is linear in the size of the input, but in some cases the constant factor can be as high as 40,000, making relatively small regexps consume much larger amounts of memory. After fix, each regexp being parsed is limited to a 256 MB memory footprint. Regular expressions whose representation would use more space than that are rejected. Normal use of regular expressions is unaffected.(CVE-2022-41715)\r\n\r\nThe net/http HTTP/1.1 client mishandled the case where a server responds to a request with an &quot;Expect: 100-continue&quot; header with a non-informational (200 or higher) status. This mishandling could leave a client connection in an invalid state, where the next request sent on the connection will fail. An attacker sending a request to a net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy proxy can exploit this mishandling to cause a denial of service by sending &quot;Expect: 100-continue&quot; requests which elicit a non-informational response from the backend. Each such request leaves the proxy with an invalid connection, and causes one subsequent request using that connection to fail.(CVE-2024-24791)\r\n\r\ngorilla/schema converts structs to and from form values. Prior to version 1.4.1 Running `schema.Decoder.Decode()` on a struct that has a field of type `[]struct{...}` opens it up to malicious attacks regarding memory allocations, taking advantage of the sparse slice functionality. Any use of `schema.Decoder.Decode()` on a struct with arrays of other structs could be vulnerable to this memory exhaustion vulnerability. Version 1.4.1 contains a patch for the issue.(CVE-2024-37298)\r\n\r\nA vulnerability was found in Golang FIPS OpenSSL. This flaw allows a malicious user to randomly cause an uninitialized buffer length variable with a zeroed buffer to be returned in FIPS mode. It may also be possible to force a false positive match between non-equal hashes when comparing a trusted computed hmac sum to an untrusted input sum if an attacker can send a zeroed buffer in place of a pre-computed sum.\u00a0 It is also possible to force a derived key to be all zeros instead of an unpredictable value.\u00a0 This may have follow-on implications for the Go TLS stack.(CVE-2024-9355)",
