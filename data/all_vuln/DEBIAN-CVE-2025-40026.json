{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-40026","published":"2025-10-28T10:15:42.167Z","modified":"2025-12-12T15:10:25.207674Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-40026"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: x86: Don't (re)check L1 intercepts when completing userspace I/O  When completing emulation of instruction that generated a userspace exit for I/O, don't recheck L1 intercepts as KVM has already finished that phase of instruction execution, i.e. has already committed to allowing L2 to perform I/O.  If L1 (or host userspace) modifies the I/O permission bitmaps during the exit to userspace,  KVM will treat the access as being intercepted despite already having emulated the I/O access.  Pivot on EMULTYPE_NO_DECODE to detect that KVM is completing emulation. Of the three users of EMULTYPE_NO_DECODE, only complete_emulated_io() (the intended \"recipient\") can reach the code in question.  gp_interception()'s use is mutually exclusive with is_guest_mode(), and complete_emulated_insn_gp() unconditionally pairs EMULTYPE_NO_DECODE with EMULTYPE_SKIP.  The bad behavior was detected by a syzkaller program that toggles port I/O interception during the userspace I/O exit, ultimately resulting in a WARN on vcpu->arch.pio.count being non-zero due to KVM no completing emulation of the I/O instruction.
