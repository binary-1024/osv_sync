Move MTU from hci_dev to hci_conn to validate MTU and stop the connection process earlier if MTU is invalid. Also, add a missing validation in read_buffer_size() and make it return an error value if the validation fails. Now hci_conn_add() returns ERR_PTR() as it can fail due to the both a kzalloc failure and invalid MTU value.  divide error: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN NOPTI CPU: 0 PID: 67 Comm: kworker/u5:0 Tainted:
