The end result is that via an ioctl an untrusted app can control the ui32PageIndex offset in the expression:\n        sPA.uiAddr = page_to_phys(psOSPageArrayData->pagearray[ui32PageIndex]);\nWith the current PoC this crashes as an OOB read. However, given that the OOB read value is ending up as the address field of a struct I think i seems plausible that this could lead to an OOB write if the attacker is able to cause the OOB read to pull an interesting kernel address. Regardless if this is a read or write, it is a High severity issue in the kernel.","affected":[{"package":{"name":":unknown:","ecosystem":"Android"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"SoCVersion:0"},{"fixed":"SoCVersion:2022-09-05"}]}],"versions":["SoCVersion"],"ecosystem_specific":{"severity":"High","spl":"2022-09-05","types":["EoP"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/android-osv/ASB-A-238904312.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2022-09-01"}]}
