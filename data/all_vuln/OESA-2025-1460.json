It uses GObjects and the glib main loop, to integrate well with GNOME applications, and also has a synchronous API, for use in threaded applications.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA flaw was found in libsoup, where the soup_headers_parse_request() function may be vulnerable to an out-of-bound read. This flaw allows a malicious user to use a specially crafted HTTP request to crash the HTTP server.(CVE-2025-32906)\n\nA flaw was found in libsoup. SoupContentSniffer may be vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference in the sniff_mp4 function. The HTTP server may cause the libsoup client to crash.(CVE-2025-32909)\n\nA flaw was found in libsoup, where soup_auth_digest_authenticate() is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference. This issue may cause the libsoup client to crash.(CVE-2025-32910)\n\nA flaw was found in libsoup, which is vulnerable to a use-after-free memory issue not on the heap in the soup_message_headers_get_content_disposition() function. This flaw allows a malicious HTTP client to cause memory corruption in the libsoup server.(CVE-2025-32911)\n\nA flaw was found in libsoup, where SoupAuthDigest is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference. The HTTP server may cause the libsoup client to crash.(CVE-2025-32912)\n\nA flaw was found in libsoup, where the soup_message_headers_get_content_disposition() function is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference.
