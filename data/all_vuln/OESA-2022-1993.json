The vulnerability affects all currently maintained BIND 9 branches (9.11, 9.11-S, 9.16, 9.16-S, 9.17) as well as all other versions of BIND 9.(CVE-2021-25215)\r\n\r\nIn BIND 9.8.5 -&gt; 9.8.8, 9.9.3 -&gt; 9.11.29, 9.12.0 -&gt; 9.16.13, and versions BIND 9.9.3-S1 -&gt; 9.11.29-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -&gt; 9.16.13-S1 of BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions 9.17.0 -&gt; 9.17.11 of the BIND 9.17 development branch, when a vulnerable version of named receives a malformed IXFR triggering the flaw described above, the named process will terminate due to a failed assertion the next time the transferred secondary zone is refreshed.(CVE-2021-25214)\r\n\r\nIn BIND 9.3.0 -&gt; 9.11.35, 9.12.0 -&gt; 9.16.21, and versions 9.9.3-S1 -&gt; 9.11.35-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -&gt; 9.16.21-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions 9.17.0 -&gt; 9.17.18 of the BIND 9.17 development branch, exploitation of broken authoritative servers using a flaw in response processing can cause degradation in BIND resolver performance. The way the lame cache is currently designed makes it possible for its internal data structures to grow almost infinitely, which may cause significant delays in client query processing.(CVE-2021-25219)\r\n\r\nBIND 9.11.0 -&gt; 9.11.36 9.12.0 -&gt; 9.16.26 9.17.0 -&gt; 9.18.0 BIND Supported Preview Editions: 9.11.4-S1 -&gt; 9.11.36-S1 9.16.8-S1 -&gt; 9.16.26-S1 Versions of BIND 9 earlier than those shown - back to 9.1.0, including Supported Preview Editions - are also believed to be affected but have not been tested as they are EOL.
