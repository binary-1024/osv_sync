  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  octeon_ep: cancel queued works in probe error path  If it fails to get the devices's MAC address, octep_probe exits while leaving the delayed work intr_poll_task queued. When the work later runs, it's a use after free.  Move the cancelation of intr_poll_task from octep_remove into octep_device_cleanup. This does not change anything in the octep_remove flow, but octep_device_cleanup is called also in the octep_probe error path, where the cancelation is needed.  Note that the cancelation of ctrl_mbox_task has to follow intr_poll_task's, because the ctrl_mbox_task may be queued by intr_poll_task.",
