So while building the sg table and marking the pages accesses / dirty we need to hold this lock with a validated seqno.  However, the lock is reclaim tainted which makes sg_alloc_table_from_pages_segment() unusable, since it internally allocates memory.  Instead build the sg-table manually. For the non-iommu case this might lead to fewer coalesces, but if that's a problem it can be fixed up later in the resource cursor code. For the iommu case, the whole sg-table may still be coalesced to a single contigous device va region.  This avoids marking pages that we don't own dirty and accessed, and it also avoid dereferencing struct pages that we don't own.  v2: - Use assert to check whether hmm pfns are valid (Matthew Auld) - Take into account that large pages may cross range boundaries   (Matthew Auld)  v3: - Don't unnecessarily check for a non-freed sg-table. (Matthew Auld) - Add a missing up_read() in an error path.
