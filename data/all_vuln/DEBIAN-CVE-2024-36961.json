{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-36961","published":"2024-06-03T08:15:09Z","modified":"2025-09-30T03:54:32Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-36961"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  thermal/debugfs: Fix two locking issues with thermal zone debug  With the current thermal zone locking arrangement in the debugfs code, user space can open the \"mitigations\" file for a thermal zone before the zone's debugfs pointer is set which will result in a NULL pointer dereference in tze_seq_start().  Moreover, thermal_debug_tz_remove() is not called under the thermal zone lock, so it can run in parallel with the other functions accessing the thermal zone's struct thermal_debugfs object.  Then, it may clear tz->debugfs after one of those functions has checked it and the struct thermal_debugfs object may be freed prematurely.  To address the first problem, pass a pointer to the thermal zone's struct thermal_debugfs object to debugfs_create_file() in thermal_debug_tz_add() and make tze_seq_start(), tze_seq_next(), tze_seq_stop(), and tze_seq_show() retrieve it from s->private instead of a pointer to the thermal zone object.  This will ensure that tz_debugfs will be valid across the \"mitigations\" file accesses until thermal_debugfs_remove_id() called by thermal_debug_tz_remove() removes that file.  To address the second problem, use tz->lock in thermal_debug_tz_remove() around the tz->debugfs value check (in case the same thermal zone is removed at the same time in two different threads) and its reset to NULL.
