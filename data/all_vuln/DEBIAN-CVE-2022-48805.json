  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: usb: ax88179_178a: Fix out-of-bounds accesses in RX fixup  ax88179_rx_fixup() contains several out-of-bounds accesses that can be triggered by a malicious (or defective) USB device, in particular:   - The metadata array (hdr_off..hdr_off+2*pkt_cnt) can be out of bounds,    causing OOB reads and (on big-endian systems) OOB endianness flips.  - A packet can overlap the metadata array, causing a later OOB    endianness flip to corrupt data used by a cloned SKB that has already    been handed off into the network stack.  - A packet SKB can be constructed whose tail is far beyond its end,    causing out-of-bounds heap data to be considered part of the SKB's    data.  I have tested that this can be used by a malicious USB device to send a bogus ICMPv6 Echo Request and receive an ICMPv6 Echo Reply in response that contains random kernel heap data. It's probably also possible to get OOB writes from this on a little-endian system somehow - maybe by triggering skb_cow() via IP options processing -, but I haven't tested that.",
