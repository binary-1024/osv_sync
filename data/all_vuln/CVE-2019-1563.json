Applications are not affected if they use a certificate together with the private RSA key to the CMS_decrypt or PKCS7_decrypt functions to select the correct recipient info to decrypt. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201911-04"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190919-0002/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4539"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4540"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20190910.txt"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2019-5072832.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00054.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00072.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-10/msg00012.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-10/msg00016.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154467/Slackware-Security-Advisory-openssl-Updates.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=08229ad838c50f644d7e928e2eef147b4308ad64"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=631f94db0065c78181ca9ba5546ebc8bb3884b97"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=e21f8cf78a125cd3c8c0d1a1a6c8bb0b901f893f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10365"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/09/msg00026.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GY6SNRJP2S7Y42GIIDO3HXPNMDYN2U3A/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZN4VVQJ3JDCHGIHV4Y2YTXBYQZ6PWQ7E/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Oct/0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Oct/1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Sep/25"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K97324400?utm_source=f5support&amp%3Butm_medium=RSS"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4376-1/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4376-2/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4504-1/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2019-09"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
