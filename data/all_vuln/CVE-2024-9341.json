When FIPS mode is enabled on a system, container runtimes may incorrectly handle certain file paths due to improper validation in the containers/common Go library. This flaw allows an attacker to exploit symbolic links and trick the system into mounting sensitive host directories inside a container. This issue also allows attackers to access critical host files, bypassing the intended isolation between containers and the host system.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10147"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10818"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:7925"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8039"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8112"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8238"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8263"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8428"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8690"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8694"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8846"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9454"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9459"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-9341"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2315691"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/containers/common/blob/384f77532f67afc8a73d8e0c4adb0d195df57714/pkg/subscriptions/subscriptions.go#L169"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/containers/common/blob/384f77532f67afc8a73d8e0c4adb0d195df57714/pkg/subscriptions/subscriptions.go#L349"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N"}]}
