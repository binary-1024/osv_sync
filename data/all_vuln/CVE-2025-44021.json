A malicious project assigned as a node owner can provide a path to any local file (readable by ironic-conductor), which may then be written to the target node disk. This is difficult to exploit in practice, because a node deployed in this manner should never reach the ACTIVE state, but it still represents a danger in environments running with non-default, insecure configurations such as with automated cleaning disabled. The fixed versions are 24.1.3, 26.1.1, and 29.0.1.","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/2107847"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2025-001.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/05/08/1"}]}
