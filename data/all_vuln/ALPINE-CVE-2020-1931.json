{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2020-1931","published":"2020-01-30T18:15:11.410Z","modified":"2025-11-19T06:17:36.681347Z","upstream":["CVE-2020-1931"],"details":"A command execution issue was found in Apache SpamAssassin prior to 3.4.3. Carefully crafted nefarious Configuration (.cf) files can be configured to run system commands similar to CVE-2018-11805. This issue is less stealthy and attempts to exploit the issue will throw warnings. Thanks to Damian Lukowski at credativ for reporting the issue ethically. With this bug unpatched, exploits can be injected in a number of scenarios though doing so remotely is difficult. In addition to upgrading to SA 3.4.4, we again recommend that users should only use update channels or 3rd party .cf files from trusted places.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"spamassassin","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/spamassassin?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.4.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.2.5-r0","3.2.5-r1","3.3.0-r1","3.3.1-r0","3.3.1-r1","3.3.1-r2","3.3.1-r3","3.3.1-r4","3.3.1-r5","3.3.1-r6","3.3.1-r7","3.3.1-r8","3.3.1-r9","3.3.2-r0","3.3.2-r1","3.4.0-r0","3.4.0-r1","3.4.0-r2","3.4.1-r0","3.4.1-r1","3.4.1-r2","3.4.1-r3","3.4.1-r4","3.4.1-r5","3.4.1-r6","3.4.1-r7","3.4.1-r8","3.4.2-r0","3.4.2-r1","3.4.2-r2","3.4.2-r3","3.4.3-r0","3.4.3-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-1931.json"}},{"package":{"name":"spamassassin","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/spamassassin?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.4.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.2.5-r0","3.2.5-r1","3.3.0-r1","3.3.1-r0","3.3.1-r1","3.3.1-r2","3.3.1-r3","3.3.1-r4","3.3.1-r5","3.3.1-r6","3.3.1-r7","3.3.1-r8","3.3.1-r9","3.3.2-r0","3.3.2-r1","3.4.0-r0","3.4.0-r1","3.4.0-r2","3.4.1-r0","3.4.1-r1","3.4.1-r2","3.4.1-r3","3.4.1-r4","3.4.1-r5","3.4.1-r6","3.4.1-r7","3.4.1-r8","3.4.2-r0","3.4.2-r1","3.4.2-r2","3.4.2-r3","3.4.2-r4","3.4.2-r5","3.4.3-r0","3.4.3-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-1931.json"}},{"package":{"name":"spamassassin","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/spamassassin?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.4.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.2.5-r0","3.2.5-r1","3.3.0-r1","3.3.1-r0","3.3.1-r1","3.3.1-r2","3.3.1-r3","3.3.1-r4","3.3.1-r5","3.3.1-r6","3.3.1-r7","3.3.1-r8","3.3.1-r9","3.3.2-r0","3.3.2-r1","3.4.0-r0","3.4.0-r1","3.4.0-r2","3.4.1-r0","3.4.1-r1","3.4.1-r2","3.4.1-r3","3.4.1-r4","3.4.1-r5","3.4.1-r6","3.4.1-r7","3.4.1-r8","3.4.2-r0","3.4.2-r1","3.4.2-r2","3.4.2-r3","3.4.2-r4","3.4.2-r5","3.4.3-r0","3.4.3-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-1931.json"}},{"package":{"name":"spamassassin","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/spamassassin?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.4.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.2.5-r0","3.2.5-r1","3.3.0-r1","3.3.1-r0","3.3.1-r1","3.3.1-r2","3.3.1-r3","3.3.1-r4","3.3.1-r5","3.3.1-r6","3.3.1-r7","3.3.1-r8","3.3.1-r9","3.3.2-r0","3.3.2-r1","3.4.0-r0","3.4.0-r1","3.4.0-r2","3.4.1-r0","3.4.1-r1","3.4.1-r2","3.4.1-r3","3.4.1-r4","3.4.1-r5","3.4.1-r6","3.4.1-r7","3.4.1-r8","3.4.2-r0","3.4.2-r1","3.4.2-r2","3.4.2-r3","3.4.2-r4","3.4.2-r5","3.4.3-r0","3.4.3-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-1931.json"}},{"package":{"name":"spamassassin","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/spamassassin?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.4.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.2.5-r0","3.2.5-r1","3.3.0-r1","3.3.1-r0","3.3.1-r1","3.3.1-r2","3.3.1-r3","3.3.1-r4","3.3.1-r5","3.3.1-r6","3.3.1-r7","3.3.1-r8","3.3.1-r9","3.3.2-r0","3.3.2-r1","3.4.0-r0","3.4.0-r1","3.4.0-r2","3.4.1-r0","3.4.1-r1","3.4.1-r2","3.4.1-r3","3.4.1-r4","3.4.1-r5","3.4.1-r6","3.4.1-r7","3.4.1-r8","3.4.2-r0","3.4.2-r1","3.4.2-r2","3.4.2-r3","3.4.2-r4","3.4.2-r5","3.4.3-r0","3.4.3-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-1931.json"}},{"package":{"name":"spamassassin","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/spamassassin?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.4.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.2.5-r0","3.2.5-r1","3.3.0-r1","3.3.1-r0","3.3.1-r1","3.3.1-r2","3.3.1-r3","3.3.1-r4","3.3.1-r5","3.3.1-r6","3.3.1-r7","3.3.1-r8","3.3.1-r9","3.3.2-r0","3.3.2-r1","3.4.0-r0","3.4.0-r1","3.4.0-r2","3.4.1-r0","3.4.1-r1","3.4.1-r2","3.4.1-r3","3.4.1-r4","3.4.1-r5","3.4.1-r6","3.4.1-r7","3.4.1-r8","3.4.2-r0","3.4.2-r1","3.4.2-r2","3.4.2-r3","3.4.2-r4","3.4.2-r5","3.4.3-r0","3.4.3-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-1931.json"}},{"package":{"name":"spamassassin","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/spamassassin?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.4.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.2.5-r0","3.2.5-r1","3.3.0-r1","3.3.1-r0","3.3.1-r1","3.3.1-r2","3.3.1-r3","3.3.1-r4","3.3.1-r5","3.3.1-r6","3.3.1-r7","3.3.1-r8","3.3.1-r9","3.3.2-r0","3.3.2-r1","3.4.0-r0","3.4.0-r1","3.4.0-r2","3.4.1-r0","3.4.1-r1","3.4.1-r2","3.4.1-r3","3.4.1-r4","3.4.1-r5","3.4.1-r6","3.4.1-r7","3.4.1-r8","3.4.2-r0","3.4.2-r1","3.4.2-r2","3.4.2-r3","3.4.2-r4","3.4.2-r5","3.4.3-r0","3.4.3-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-1931.json"}},{"package":{"name":"spamassassin","eco
