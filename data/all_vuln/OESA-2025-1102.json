  "details": "Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser, designed for standards compliance, performance and portability.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nAn attacker could have caused a use-after-free via crafted XSLT data, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 135, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.20, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.7, Thunderbird &lt; 128.7, and Thunderbird &lt; 135.(CVE-2025-1009)\n\nAn attacker could have caused a use-after-free via the Custom Highlight API, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 135, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.20, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.7, Thunderbird &lt; 128.7, and Thunderbird &lt; 135.(CVE-2025-1010)\n\nA bug in WebAssembly code generation could have lead to a crash. It may have been possible for an attacker to leverage this to achieve code execution. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 135, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.7, Thunderbird &lt; 128.7, and Thunderbird &lt; 135.(CVE-2025-1011)\n\nA race during concurrent delazification could have led to a use-after-free. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 135, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.20, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.7, Thunderbird &lt; 128.7, and Thunderbird &lt; 135.(CVE-2025-1012)\n\nA race condition could have led to private browsing tabs being opened in normal browsing windows. This could have resulted in a potential privacy leak. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 135, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.7, Thunderbird &lt; 128.7, and Thunderbird &lt; 135.(CVE-2025-1013)\n\nCertificate length was not properly checked when added to a certificate store. In practice only trusted data was processed. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 135, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.7, Thunderbird &lt; 128.7, and Thunderbird &lt; 135.(CVE-2025-1014)\n\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 134, Thunderbird 134, Firefox ESR 128.6, and Thunderbird 128.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 135, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.7, Thunderbird &lt; 128.7, and Thunderbird &lt; 135.(CVE-2025-1017)",
