A specially crafted MFER file can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.This vulnerability manifests on line 8970 of biosig.c on the current master branch (35a819fa), when the Tag is 63:\r \r                 else if (tag==63) {\r                     uint8_t tag2=255, len2=255;\r \r                     count = 0;\r                     while ((count<len) && !(FlagInfiniteLength && len2==0 && tag2==0)){\r                         curPos += ifread(&tag2,1,1,hdr);\r                         curPos += ifread(&len2,1,1,hdr);\r                         if (VERBOSE_LEVEL==9)\r                             fprintf(stdout,\"MFER: tag=%3i chan=%2i len=%-4i tag2=%3i len2=%3i curPos=%i %li count=%4i\\n\",tag,chan,len,tag2,len2,curPos,iftell(hdr),(int)count);\r \r                         if (FlagInfiniteLength && len2==0 && tag2==0) break;\r \r                         count  += (2+len2);\r                         curPos += ifread(&buf,1,len2,hdr);\r \r Here, the number of bytes read is not the Data Length decoded from the current frame in the file (`len`) but rather is a new length contained in a single octet read from the same input file (`len2`). Despite this, a stack-based buffer overflow condition can still occur, as the destination buffer is still `buf`, which has a size of only 128 bytes, while `len2` can be as large as 255.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"biosig","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/biosig?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.1.2-4","2.3.3-1","2.4.0-1","2.4.0-2","2.5.0-1","2.5.2-1","2.5.2-2","2.6.0-1","2.6.1-1","3.9.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-54489.json"}},{"package":{"name":"biosig","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/biosig?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.5.0-1","2.5.2-1","2.5.2-2","2.6.0-1","2.6.1-1","3.9.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-54489.json"}},{"package":{"name":"biosig","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/biosig?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.9.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-54489.json"}},{"package":{"name":"biosig","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/biosig?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.9.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-54489.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-54489"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
