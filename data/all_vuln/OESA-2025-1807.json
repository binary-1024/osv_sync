The complete control of the client is made by the programmer. With libssh, you can remotely execute programs, transfer files, use a secure and transparent tunnel for your remote programs. With its Secure FTP implementation, you can play with remote files easily, without third-party programs others than libcrypto (from openssl).\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability classified as critical has been found in libssh (version now known).CWE is classifying the issue as CWE-125. The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.This is going to have an impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.There is no information about possible countermeasures known.
