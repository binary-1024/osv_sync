JCR lookup through JNDI has been disabled by default in 2.22.2. Users of this feature need to enable it explicitly and are adviced to review their use of JNDI URI for JCR lookup.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2b5babfc2fcf4e0aa198dfcc6b850854d3daae21"}]}],"versions":["jackrabbit-2.21.22","jackrabbit-2.21.23","jackrabbit-2.21.24","jackrabbit-2.21.25","jackrabbit-2.21.26-beta","jackrabbit-2.21.27-beta","jackrabbit-2.22.0","jackrabbit-2.22.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-58782.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/t4wdrost6dh17dh406g792j9wq6xmy6v"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/09/06/3"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
