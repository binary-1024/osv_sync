There is an out-of-bounds and crash in read_descriptors in drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c.(CVE-2023-37453)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.5.9, exploitable by local users with userspace access to MMIO registers. Incorrect access checking in the #VC handler and instruction emulation of the SEV-ES emulation of MMIO accesses could lead to arbitrary write access to kernel memory (and thus privilege escalation). This depends on a race condition through which userspace can replace an instruction before the #VC handler reads it.(CVE-2023-46813)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.5.9. During a race with SQ thread exit, an io_uring/fdinfo.c io_uring_show_fdinfo NULL pointer dereference can occur.(CVE-2023-46862)\r\n\r\nA use-after-free vulnerability was found in drivers/nvme/target/tcp.c` in `nvmet_tcp_free_crypto` due to a logical bug in the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem in the Linux kernel. This issue may allow a malicious user to cause a use-after-free and double-free problem, which may permit remote code execution or lead to local privilege escalation in case that the attacker already has local privileges.(CVE-2023-5178)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kernel","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/kernel&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["kernel-debugsource-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","perf-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-devel-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-headers-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-source-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["kernel-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["kernel-debuginfo-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-source-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-headers-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","perf-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-devel-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-5.10.0-136.54.0.133.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2023-1798.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2023-1798"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37453"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46813"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46862"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-5178"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
