  "details": "An authentication flaw was found in ceph. When the monitor handles\nCEPHX_GET_AUTH_SESSION_KEY requests, it doesn't sanitize other_keys,\nallowing key reuse. An attacker who can request a global_id can exploit the\nability of any user to request a global_id previously associated with\nanother user, as ceph does not force the reuse of old keys to generate new\nones. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality\nand integrity as well as system availability (CVE-2021-20288).\n",
