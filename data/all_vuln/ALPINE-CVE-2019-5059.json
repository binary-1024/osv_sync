A specially crafted XPM image can cause an integer overflow, allocating too small of a buffer. This buffer can then be written out of bounds resulting in a heap overflow, ultimately ending in code execution. An attacker can display a specially crafted image to trigger this vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"sdl2_image","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/sdl2_image?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.0.5-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.1-r0","2.0.1-r1","2.0.1-r2","2.0.1-r3","2.0.2-r0","2.0.3-r0","2.0.4-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-5059.json"}},{"package":{"name":"sdl2_image","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.7","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/sdl2_image?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.0.5-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.1-r0","2.0.1-r1","2.0.1-r2","2.0.1-r3","2.0.2-r0","2.0.2-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-5059.json"}},{"package":{"name":"sdl2_image","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.8","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/sdl2_image?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.0.5-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.1-r0","2.0.1-r1","2.0.1-r2","2.0.1-r3","2.0.2-r0","2.0.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-5059.json"}},{"package":{"name":"sdl2_image","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.9","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/sdl2_image?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.0.5-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.1-r0","2.0.1-r1","2.0.1-r2","2.0.1-r3","2.0.2-r0","2.0.3-r0","2.0.4-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-5059.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2019-5059"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
