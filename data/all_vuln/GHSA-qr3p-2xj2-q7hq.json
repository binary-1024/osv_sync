(i.e. user-submitted HTTP/HTTPS requests reach Solr as-is, unmodified or restricted by any intervening proxy or gateway)\n\nUsers can mitigate this vulnerability by ensuring that their RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin configuration specifies the \"all\" pre-defined permission and associates the permission with an \"admin\" or other privileged role.  Users can also upgrade to a Solr version outside of the impacted range, such as the recently released Solr 9.10.1.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.apache.solr:solr-core","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.solr/solr-core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.3.0"},{"fixed":"9.10.1"}]}],"versions":["5.3.0","5.3.1","5.3.2","5.4.0","5.4.1","5.5.0","5.5.1","5.5.2","5.5.3","5.5.4","5.5.5","6.0.0","6.0.1","6.1.0","6.2.0","6.2.1","6.3.0","6.4.0","6.4.1","6.4.2","6.5.0","6.5.1","6.6.0","6.6.1","6.6.2","6.6.3","6.6.4","6.6.5","6.6.6","7.0.0","7.0.1","7.1.0","7.2.0","7.2.1","7.3.0","7.3.1","7.4.0","7.5.0","7.6.0","7.7.0","7.7.1","7.7.2","7.7.3","8.0.0","8.1.0","8.1.1","8.10.0","8.10.1","8.11.0","8.11.1","8.11.2","8.11.3","8.11.4","8.2.0","8.3.0","8.3.1","8.4.0","8.4.1","8.5.0","8.5.1","8.5.2","8.6.0","8.6.1","8.6.2","8.6.3","8.7.0","8.8.0","8.8.1","8.8.2","8.9.0","9.0.0","9.1.0","9.1.1","9.10.0","9.2.0","9.2.1","9.3.0","9.4.0","9.4.1","9.5.0","9.6.0","9.6.1","9.7.0","9.8.0","9.8.1","9.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-qr3p-2xj2-q7hq/GHSA-qr3p-2xj2-q7hq.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22022"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/commit/c135e6335c7158fa26e96b0dc386f825255b47c0"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/apache/solr"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-18054"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/d59hqbgo7p62myq7mgfpz7or8n1j7wbn"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2026/01/20/4"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-285"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-21T22:56:47Z","nvd_published_at":"2026-01-21T14:16:06Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N"}]}
