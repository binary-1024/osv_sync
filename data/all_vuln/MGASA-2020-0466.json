  "details": "Vulnerabilities in the Oracle VM VirtualBox are fixed in version 6.1.16.\n\nAn attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on\nthe target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability which can lead\nto execute code in the context of the hypervisor. (CVE-2020-14872).\n\nAn attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on\nthe target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the shader_generate_main function. The issue\nresults from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can\nresult in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can\nleverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in\nthe context of the hypervisor. (CVE-2020-14881).\n\nAn attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on\nthe target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the shader_record_register_usage function.\nThe issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data,\nwhich can result in a type confusion condition.

(CVE-2020-14886).\n\nAn attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on\nthe target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability which can\nresult in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all\nOracle VM VirtualBox accessible data. (CVE-2020-14889).\n\nAn attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on\nthe target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability which result\nin unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash\n(complete DOS) of Oracle VM VirtualBox. (CVE-2020-14892).\n\nAlso this updated version has some bugfix (See upstream Changelog).\n",
