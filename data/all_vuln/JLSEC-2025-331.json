From version 1.6.0 to before 1.6.51, there is a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the libpng simplified API function png_image_finish_read when processing 16-bit interlaced PNGs with 8-bit output format. Attacker-crafted interlaced PNG files cause heap writes beyond allocated buffer bounds. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.51.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libpng_jll","ecosystem":"Julia","purl":"pkg:julia/libpng_jll?uuid=b53b4c65-9356-5827-b1ea-8c7a1a84506f"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.6.51+0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/SecurityAdvisories.jl/tree/generated/osv/2025/JLSEC-2025-331.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/commit/16b5e3823918840aae65c0a6da57c78a5a496a4d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/commit/218612ddd6b17944e21eda56caf8b4bf7779d1ea"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/issues/755"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/pull/757"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/security/advisories/GHSA-7wv6-48j4-hj3g"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC-BY-4.0","sources":[{"html_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65018","id":"CVE-2025-65018","imported":"2025-11-27T03:28:04.932Z","modified":"2025-11-26T18:34:53.650Z","published":"2025-11-25T00:15:47.610Z","url":"https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2025-65018"}]}}
