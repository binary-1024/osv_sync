  "details": "A race condition flaw, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, was found in\nthe mod_status httpd module. A remote attacker able to access a status page\nserved by mod_status on a server using a threaded Multi-Processing Module\n(MPM) could send a specially crafted request that would cause the httpd\nchild process to crash or, possibly, allow the attacker to execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the \"apache\" user (CVE-2014-0226).\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the mod_proxy httpd module. A remote\nattacker could send a specially crafted request to a server configured as a\nreverse proxy using a threaded Multi-Processing Modules (MPM) that would\ncause the httpd child process to crash (CVE-2014-0117).\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way httpd's mod_deflate module\nhandled request body decompression (configured via the \"DEFLATE\" input\nfilter). A remote attacker able to send a request whose body would be\ndecompressed could use this flaw to consume an excessive amount of system\nmemory and CPU on the target system (CVE-2014-0118).\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way httpd's mod_cgid module\nexecuted CGI scripts that did not read data from the standard input.\nA remote attacker could submit a specially crafted request that would cause\nthe httpd child process to hang indefinitely (CVE-2014-0231).\n",
