  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf, arm64: Fix fp initialization for exception boundary  In the ARM64 BPF JIT when prog->aux->exception_boundary is set for a BPF program, find_used_callee_regs() is not called because for a program acting as exception boundary, all callee saved registers are saved. find_used_callee_regs() sets `ctx->fp_used = true;` when it sees FP being used in any of the instructions.  For programs acting as exception boundary, ctx->fp_used remains false even if frame pointer is used by the program and therefore, FP is not set-up for such programs in the prologue. This can cause the kernel to crash due to a pagefault.  Fix it by setting ctx->fp_used = true for exception boundary programs as fp is always saved in such programs.",
