{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-22262","published":"2026-01-27T18:18:52.922Z","modified":"2026-01-30T22:53:14.612601Z","aliases":["GHSA-9qg5-2gwh-xp86"],"summary":"Suricata datasets: stack overflow when saving a set","details":"Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine. While saving a dataset a stack buffer is used to prepare the data. Prior to versions 8.0.3 and 7.0.14, if the data in the dataset is too large, this can result in a stack overflow. Versions 8.0.3 and 7.0.14 contain a patch. As a workaround, do not use rules with datasets `save` nor `state` options.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"163bd652dfa92959e918a952429b939fa81f7b88"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.0.14"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata","events":[{"introduced":"9956286fb89f9cad9e9f95b99dc751f8666617b7"},{"fixed":"3bd9f773bdc65d7bede2f0576790a68fb68b7476"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"8.0.0"},{"fixed":"8.0.3"}]}}],"versions":["suricata-0.8.2","suricata-1.0.0","suricata-1.0.1","suricata-1.0.2","suricata-1.1","suricata-1.1beta1","suricata-1.1beta2","suricata-1.1beta3","suricata-1.1rc1","suricata-1.2","suricata-1.2.1","suricata-1.2beta1","suricata-1.2rc1","suricata-1.3","suricata-1.3.1","suricata-1.3beta1","suricata-1.3beta2","suricata-1.3rc1","suricata-1.4","suricata-1.4beta1","suricata-1.4beta2","suricata-1.4beta3","suricata-1.4rc1","suricata-2.0","suricata-2.0.1","suricata-2.0.1rc1","suricata-2.0.2","suricata-2.0beta1","suricata-2.0beta2","suricata-2.0rc1","suricata-2.0rc2","suricata-2.0rc3","suricata-2.1beta1","suricata-2.1beta2","suricata-2.1beta3","suricata-2.1beta4","suricata-3.0","suricata-3.0.1","suricata-3.0.1RC1","suricata-3.0RC1","suricata-3.0RC2","suricata-3.0RC3","suricata-3.1","suricata-3.1.1","suricata-3.1.2","suricata-3.1RC1","suricata-3.2","suricata-3.2.1","suricata-3.2RC1","suricata-3.2beta1","suricata-4.0.0","suricata-4.0.0-beta1","suricata-4.0.0-rc1","suricata-4.0.0-rc2","suricata-4.0.1","suricata-4.1.0","suricata-4.1.0-beta1","suricata-4.1.0-rc1","suricata-4.1.0-rc2","suricata-4.1.1","suricata-4.1.2","suricata-5.0.0","suricata-5.0.0-beta1","suricata-5.0.0-rc1","suricata-5.0.1","suricata-6.0.0","suricata-6.0.0-beta1","suricata-6.0.0-rc1","suricata-6.0.1","suricata-7.0.0","suricata-7.0.0-beta1","suricata-7.0.0-rc1","suricata-7.0.0-rc2","suricata-7.0.1","suricata-7.0.10","suricata-7.0.11","suricata-7.0.12","suricata-7.0.13","suricata-7.0.2","suricata-7.0.3","suricata-7.0.4","suricata-7.0.5","suricata-7.0.6","suricata-7.0.7","suricata-7.0.8","suricata-7.0.9","suricata-8.0.0","suricata-8.0.1","suricata-8.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22262.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22262.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/0eff24213763c2aa2bb0957901d5dc1e18414dbf"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/27a2180bceaa3477419c78c54fce364398d011f1"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/32609e6896f9079c175665a94005417cec7637eb"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/32a1b9ae6aa80a60c073897e38a2ac6ea0f64521"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/d6bc718e303ecbec5999066b8bc88eeeca743658"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/d767dfadcd166f82683757818b9e46943326ac90"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-9qg5-2gwh-xp86"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22262"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/8110"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-121"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22262.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
