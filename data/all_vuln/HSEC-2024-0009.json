  "details": "# Public key confusion in third-party blocks\n\nThird-party blocks can be generated without transferring the whole token to the third-party authority. Instead, a `ThirdPartyBlock` request can be sent, providing only the necessary info to generate a third-party block and to sign it:\n\n- the public key of the previous block (used in the signature);\n- the public keys part of the token symbol table (for public key interning in datalog expressions).\n\nA third-party block request forged by a malicious user can trick the third-party authority into generating datalog trusting the wrong keypair.\n",
