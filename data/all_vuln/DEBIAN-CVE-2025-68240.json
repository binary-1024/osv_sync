{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68240","published":"2025-12-16T15:15:53.173Z","modified":"2026-01-10T14:07:59.998164Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-68240"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: avoid having an active sc_timer before freeing sci  Because kthread_stop did not stop sc_task properly and returned -EINTR, the sc_timer was not properly closed, ultimately causing the problem [1] reported by syzbot when freeing sci due to the sc_timer not being closed.  Because the thread sc_task main function nilfs_segctor_thread() returns 0 when it succeeds, when the return value of kthread_stop() is not 0 in nilfs_segctor_destroy(), we believe that it has not properly closed sc_timer.  We use timer_shutdown_sync() to sync wait for sc_timer to shutdown, and set the value of sc_task to NULL under the protection of lock sc_state_lock, so as to avoid the issue caused by sc_timer not being properly shutdowned.
