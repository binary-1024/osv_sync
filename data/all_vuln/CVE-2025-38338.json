  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/nfs/read: fix double-unlock bug in nfs_return_empty_folio()\n\nSometimes, when a file was read while it was being truncated by\nanother NFS client, the kernel could deadlock because folio_unlock()\nwas called twice, and the second call would XOR back the `PG_locked`\nflag.\n\nMost of the time (depending on the timing of the truncation), nobody\nnotices the problem because folio_unlock() gets called three times,\nwhich flips `PG_locked` back off:\n\n 1. vfs_read, nfs_read_folio, ... nfs_read_add_folio,\n    nfs_return_empty_folio\n 2. vfs_read, nfs_read_folio, ... netfs_read_collection,\n    netfs_unlock_abandoned_read_pages\n 3. vfs_read, ... nfs_do_read_folio, nfs_read_add_folio,\n    nfs_return_empty_folio\n\nThe problem is that nfs_read_add_folio() is not supposed to unlock the\nfolio if fscache is enabled, and a nfs_netfs_folio_unlock() check is\nmissing in nfs_return_empty_folio().\n\nRarely this leads to a warning in netfs_read_collection():\n\n ------------[ cut here ]------------\n R=0000031c: folio 10 is not locked\n WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 29 at fs/netfs/read_collect.c:133 netfs_read_collection+0x7c0/0xf00\n [...]\n Workqueue: events_unbound netfs_read_collection_worker\n RIP: 0010:netfs_read_collection+0x7c0/0xf00\n [...]\n Call Trace:\n  <TASK>\n  netfs_read_collection_worker+0x67/0x80\n  process_one_work+0x12e/0x2c0\n  worker_thread+0x295/0x3a0\n\nMost of the time, however, processes just get stuck forever in\nfolio_wait_bit_common(), waiting for `PG_locked` to disappear, which\nnever happens because nobody is really holding the folio lock.",
