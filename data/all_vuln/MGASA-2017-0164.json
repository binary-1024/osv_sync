  "details": "It was found that apt_key module does not properly verify key\nfingerprints, allowing remote adversary to create an OpenPGP key which\nmatches the short key ID and inject this key instead of the correct key\n(CVE-2016-8614).\n\nIt is reported that in Ansible, under some circumstances the mysql_user\nmodule may fail to correctly change a password. Thus an old password\nmay still be active when it should have been changed (CVE-2016-8647).\n\nData for lookup plugins used as variables was not being correctly\nmarked as \"unsafe\" (CVE-2017-7481).\n\nThe ansible package has been updated to version 2.3.1 to fix these\nissues and several other bugs.\n",
