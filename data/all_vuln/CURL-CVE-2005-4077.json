  "summary": "URL Buffer Overflow",
  "details": "libcurl's URL parser function can overflow a heap based buffer in two ways, if\ngiven a too long URL.\n\nThese overflows happen if you\n\n 1 - pass in a URL with no protocol (like \"http://\") prefix, using no slash\n     and the string is 256 bytes or longer. This leads to a single zero byte\n     overflow of the heap buffer.\n\n 2 - pass in a URL with only a question mark as separator (no slash) between\n     the host and the query part of the URL. This leads to a single zero byte\n     overflow of the heap buffer.\n\nBoth overflows can be made with the same input string, leading to two single\nzero byte overwrites.\n\nThe affected flaw cannot be triggered by a redirect, but the long URL must be\npassed in \"directly\" to libcurl. It makes this a \"local\" problem. Of course,\nlots of programs may still pass in user-provided URLs to libcurl without doing\nmuch syntax checking of their own, allowing a user to exploit this\nvulnerability.",
