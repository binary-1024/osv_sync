{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50049","published":"2025-06-18T11:15:33Z","modified":"2025-09-25T03:21:54.876977Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-50049"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: DPCM: Don't pick up BE without substream  When DPCM tries to add valid BE connections at dpcm_add_paths(), it doesn't check whether the picked BE actually supports for the given stream direction.  Due to that, when an asymmetric BE stream is present, it picks up wrongly and this may result in a NULL dereference at a later point where the code assumes the existence of a corresponding BE substream.  This patch adds the check for the presence of the substream for the target BE for avoiding the problem above.  Note that we have already some fix for non-existing BE substream at commit 6246f283d5e0 (\"ASoC: dpcm: skip missing substream while applying symmetry\").  But the code path we've hit recently is rather happening before the previous fix.  So this patch tries to fix at picking up a BE instead of parsing BE lists.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50049.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50049.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50049.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-50049"}]}
