{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2019-3901","published":"2019-04-22T16:29:01Z","modified":"2025-08-09T19:01:28Z","details":"A race condition in perf_event_open() allows local attackers to leak sensitive data from setuid programs. As no relevant locks (in particular the cred_guard_mutex) are held during the ptrace_may_access() call, it is possible for the specified target task to perform an execve() syscall with setuid execution before perf_event_alloc() actually attaches to it, allowing an attacker to bypass the ptrace_may_access() check and the perf_event_exit_task(current) call that is performed in install_exec_creds() during privileged execve() calls. This issue affects kernel versions before 4.8.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/89937"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2019-3901"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/05/msg00041.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/05/msg00042.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190517-0005/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
