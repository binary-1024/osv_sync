It handles all requests in a single, non-blocking, I/O-driven process and keeps meta data and implements negative caching of failed requests.\\r\\n\\r\\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\\r\\n\\r\\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When handling the tag esi:when when ESI is enabled, Squid calls ESIExpression::Evaluate. This function uses a fixed stack buffer to hold the expression while its being evaluated. When processing the expression, it could either evaluate the top of the stack, or add a new member to the stack. When adding a new member, there is no check to ensure that the stack wont overflow.(CVE-2019-12519)\\r\\n\\r\\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"squid","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/squid&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.9-3.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["squid-4.9-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","squid-debuginfo-4.9-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","squid-debugsource-4.9-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","squid-4.9-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","squid-debuginfo-4.9-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","squid-debugsource-4.9-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["squid-4.9-3.oe1.src.rpm","squid-4.9-3.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["squid-4.9-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","squid-debuginfo-4.9-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","squid-debugsource-4.9-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","squid-4.9-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","squid-debuginfo-4.9-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","squid-debugsource-4.9-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1020.json"}},{"package":{"name":"squid","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/squid&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.9-3.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["squid-4.9-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","squid-debuginfo-4.9-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","squid-debugsource-4.9-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["squid-4.9-3.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["squid-4.9-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","squid-debuginfo-4.9-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","squid-debugsource-4.9-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1020.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1020"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12519"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Critical"}}
