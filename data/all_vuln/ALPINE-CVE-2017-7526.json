The same attack is believed to work on RSA-2048 with moderately more computation. This side-channel requires that attacker can run arbitrary software on the hardware where the private RSA key is used.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gnupg1","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gnupg1?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.23-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.4.16-r0","1.4.16-r1","1.4.16-r2","1.4.16-r3","1.4.16-r4","1.4.18-r0","1.4.19-r0","1.4.20-r0","1.4.21-r0","1.4.22-r0","1.4.22-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-7526.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnupg1","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gnupg1?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.23-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.4.16-r0","1.4.16-r1","1.4.16-r2","1.4.16-r3","1.4.16-r4","1.4.18-r0","1.4.19-r0","1.4.20-r0","1.4.21-r0","1.4.22-r0","1.4.22-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-7526.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnupg1","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gnupg1?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.23-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.4.16-r0","1.4.16-r1","1.4.16-r2","1.4.16-r3","1.4.16-r4","1.4.18-r0","1.4.19-r0","1.4.20-r0","1.4.21-r0","1.4.22-r0","1.4.22-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-7526.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnupg1","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.5","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gnupg1?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.23-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.4.16-r0","1.4.16-r1","1.4.16-r2","1.4.16-r3","1.4.16-r4","1.4.18-r0","1.4.19-r0","1.4.20-r0","1.4.21-r0","1.4.22-r0","1.4.22-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-7526.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnupg1","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.6","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gnupg1?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.23-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.4.16-r0","1.4.16-r1","1.4.16-r2","1.4.16-r3","1.4.16-r4","1.4.18-r0","1.4.19-r0","1.4.20-r0","1.4.21-r0","1.4.22-r0","1.4.22-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-7526.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnupg1","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.7","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gnupg1?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.23-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.4.16-r0","1.4.16-r1","1.4.16-r2","1.4.16-r3","1.4.16-r4","1.4.18-r0","1.4.19-r0","1.4.20-r0","1.4.21-r0","1.4.22-r0","1.4.22-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-7526.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnupg1","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.8","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gnupg1?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.23-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.4.16-r0","1.4.16-r1","1.4.16-r2","1.4.16-r3","1.4.16-r4","1.4.18-r0","1.4.19-r0","1.4.20-r0","1.4.21-r0","1.4.22-r0","1.4.22-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-7526.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnupg1","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.9","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gnupg1?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.23-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.4.16-r0","1.4.16-r1","1.4.16-r2","1.4.16-r3","1.4.16-r4","1.4.18-r0","1.4.19-r0","1.4.20-r0","1.4.21-r0","1.4.22-r0","1.4.22-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-7526.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2017-7526"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
