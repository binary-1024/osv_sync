Attackers can use the vulnerability to execute code remotely. Some reports carry suspected POC; Apache Log4j2 is a Java-based logging tool. This tool rewrites the Log4j framework and introduces a large number of rich features. The log framework is widely used in business system development to record log information. In most cases, developers may write error messages caused by user input into the log. The trigger condition of this vulnerability is that as long as the data input by external users will be recorded in the log, it can cause remote code execution.(CVE-2021-44228)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"log4j","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/log4j&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.13.2-2.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"noarch":["log4j-2.13.2-2.oe1.noarch.rpm","log4j-bom-2.13.2-2.oe1.noarch.rpm","log4j-help-2.13.2-2.oe1.noarch.rpm","log4j-jcl-2.13.2-2.oe1.noarch.rpm","log4j-jmx-gui-2.13.2-2.oe1.noarch.rpm","log4j-nosql-2.13.2-2.oe1.noarch.rpm","log4j-slf4j-2.13.2-2.oe1.noarch.rpm ","log4j-taglib-2.13.2-2.oe1.noarch.rpm","log4j-web-2.13.2-2.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["log4j-2.13.2-2.oe1.src.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1462.json"}},{"package":{"name":"log4j","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/log4j&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.13.2-2.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"noarch":["log4j-2.13.2-2.oe1.noarch.rpm","log4j-bom-2.13.2-2.oe1.noarch.rpm","log4j-help-2.13.2-2.oe1.noarch.rpm","log4j-jcl-2.13.2-2.oe1.noarch.rpm","log4j-jmx-gui-2.13.2-2.oe1.noarch.rpm","log4j-nosql-2.13.2-2.oe1.noarch.rpm","log4j-slf4j-2.13.2-2.oe1.noarch.rpm ","log4j-taglib-2.13.2-2.oe1.noarch.rpm","log4j-web-2.13.2-2.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["log4j-2.13.2-2.oe1.src.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1462.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1462"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Critical"}}
