{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-53177","published":"2024-12-27T14:15:25Z","modified":"2025-10-14T04:26:37.995811Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-53177"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smb: prevent use-after-free due to open_cached_dir error paths  If open_cached_dir() encounters an error parsing the lease from the server, the error handling may race with receiving a lease break, resulting in open_cached_dir() freeing the cfid while the queued work is pending.  Update open_cached_dir() to drop refs rather than directly freeing the cfid.  Have cached_dir_lease_break(), cfids_laundromat_worker(), and invalidate_all_cached_dirs() clear has_lease immediately while still holding cfids->cfid_list_lock, and then use this to also simplify the reference counting in cfids_laundromat_worker() and invalidate_all_cached_dirs().  Fixes this KASAN splat (which manually injects an error and lease break in open_cached_dir()):  ================================================================== BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in smb2_cached_lease_break+0x27/0xb0 Read of size 8 at addr ffff88811cc24c10 by task kworker/3:1/65  CPU: 3 UID: 0 PID: 65 Comm: kworker/3:1 Not tainted 6.12.0-rc6-g255cf264e6e5-dirty #87 Hardware name: VMware, Inc.
