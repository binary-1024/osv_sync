{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2019-9852","published":"2019-08-15T22:15:22Z","modified":"2025-09-30T03:54:40Z","upstream":["CVE-2019-9852"],"details":"LibreOffice has a feature where documents can specify that pre-installed macros can be executed on various script events such as mouse-over, document-open etc. Access is intended to be restricted to scripts under the share/Scripts/python, user/Scripts/python sub-directories of the LibreOffice install. Protection was added, to address CVE-2018-16858, to avoid a directory traversal attack where scripts in arbitrary locations on the file system could be executed. However this new protection could be bypassed by a URL encoding attack. In the fixed versions, the parsed url describing the script location is correctly encoded before further processing.
