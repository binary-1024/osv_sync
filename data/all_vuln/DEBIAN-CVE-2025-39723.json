  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfs: Fix unbuffered write error handling  If all the subrequests in an unbuffered write stream fail, the subrequest collector doesn't update the stream->transferred value and it retains its initial LONG_MAX value.  Unfortunately, if all active streams fail, then we take the smallest value of { LONG_MAX, LONG_MAX, ... } as the value to set in wreq->transferred - which is then returned from ->write_iter().  LONG_MAX was chosen as the initial value so that all the streams can be quickly assessed by taking the smallest value of all stream->transferred - but this only works if we've set any of them.  Fix this by adding a flag to indicate whether the value in stream->transferred is valid and checking that when we integrate the values.  stream->transferred can then be initialised to zero.  This was found by running the generic/750 xfstest against cifs with cache=none.  It splices data to the target file.  Once (if) it has used up all the available scratch space, the writes start failing with ENOSPC. This causes ->write_iter() to fail.  However, it was returning wreq->transferred, i.e. LONG_MAX, rather than an error (because it thought the amount transferred was non-zero) and iter_file_splice_write() would then try to clean up that amount of pipe bufferage - leading to an oops when it overran.  The kernel log showed:      CIFS: VFS: Send error in write = -28  followed by:      BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008  with:      RIP: 0010:iter_file_splice_write+0x3a4/0x520     do_splice+0x197/0x4e0  or:      RIP: 0010:pipe_buf_release (include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h:282)     iter_file_splice_write (fs/splice.c:755)  Also put a warning check into splice to announce if ->write_iter() returned that it had written more than it was asked to.",
