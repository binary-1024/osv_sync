A KVM guest using SEV-ES or SEV-SNP with multiple vCPUs can trigger a double fetch race condition vulnerability and invoke the `VMGEXIT` handler recursively. If an attacker manages to call the handler multiple times, they can trigger a stack overflow and cause a denial of service or potentially guest-to-host escape in kernel configurations without stack guard pages (`CONFIG_VMAP_STACK`).","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4155"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2213802"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
