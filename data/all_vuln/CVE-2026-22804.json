From 1.7.0 to 1.9.0, Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Termix File Manager component. The application fails to sanitize SVG file content before rendering it. This allows an attacker who has compromised a managed SSH server to plant a malicious file, which, when previewed by the Termix user, executes arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the application. The vulnerability is located in src/ui/desktop/apps/file-manager/components/FileViewer.tsx. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.10.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/termix-ssh/termix","events":[{"introduced":"a7fa40393d14dbb8ff1cc3b9d29fd7c014efc45a"},{"fixed":"ad86c2040b70c1a8b2df3f83037c1b904a67bfe4"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.7.0"},{"fixed":"1.10.0"}]}}],"versions":["release-1.7.0-tag","release-1.7.1-tag","release-1.7.2-tag","release-1.7.3-tag","release-1.8.0-tag","release-1.9.0-tag"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22804.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22804.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Termix-SSH/Termix/security/advisories/GHSA-m3cv-5hgp-hv35"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22804"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-269","CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22804.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
