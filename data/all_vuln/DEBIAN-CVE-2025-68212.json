However, the STATMOUNT_MNT_UIDMAP and STATMOUNT_MNT_GIDMAP cases directly set the struct fields instead of using offp. This leaves offp uninitialized, leading to a possible uninitialized dereference when *offp is updated.  Fix it by assigning offp for UIDMAP and GIDMAP as well, keeping the code path consistent.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.17.10-1"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.57-1","6.12.57-1~bpo12+1","6.12.63-1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.10-1","6.16.11-1","6.16.12-1","6.16.12-1~bpo13+1","6.16.12-2","6.16.3-1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16.5-1","6.16.6-1","6.16.7-1","6.16.8-1","6.16.9-1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1","6.17.2-1~exp1","6.17.5-1~exp1","6.17.6-1","6.17.7-1","6.17.7-2","6.17.8-1","6.17.8-1~bpo13+1","6.17.9-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68212.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-68212"}]}
