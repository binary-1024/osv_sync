  "details": "An information disclosure flaw was found in the way the 389 Directory Server\nstored information in the Changelog that is exposed via the 'cn=changelog'\nLDAP sub-tree. An unauthenticated user could in certain cases use this flaw\nto read data from the Changelog, which could include sensitive information\nsuch as plain-text passwords (CVE-2014-8105).\n\nIt was found that when the nsslapd-unhashed-pw-switch 389 Directory Server\nconfiguration option was set to \"off\", it did not prevent the writing of\nunhashed passwords into the Changelog. This could potentially allow an\nauthenticated user able to access the Changelog to read sensitive information\n(CVE-2014-8112).\n",
