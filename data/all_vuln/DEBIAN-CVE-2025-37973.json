  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: cfg80211: fix out-of-bounds access during multi-link element defragmentation  Currently during the multi-link element defragmentation process, the multi-link element length added to the total IEs length when calculating the length of remaining IEs after the multi-link element in cfg80211_defrag_mle(). This could lead to out-of-bounds access if the multi-link element or its corresponding fragment elements are the last elements in the IEs buffer.  To address this issue, correctly calculate the remaining IEs length by deducting the multi-link element end offset from total IEs end offset.",
