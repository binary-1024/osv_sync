A wrong if statement in the varnishd source code means that particular invalid requests from the client can trigger an assert, related to an Integer Overflow. This causes the varnishd worker process to abort and restart, losing the cached contents in the process. An attacker can therefore crash the varnishd worker process on demand and effectively keep it from serving content - a Denial-of-Service attack. The specific source-code filename containing the incorrect statement varies across releases.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"varnish","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/varnish?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.1.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.1.5-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.0-r2","3.0.2-r0","3.0.2-r1","3.0.2-r2","3.0.2-r3","3.0.2-r4","3.0.2-r5","3.0.2-r6","3.0.2-r7","3.0.3-r0","3.0.3-r1","3.0.3-r2","3.0.4-r0","3.0.4-r1","3.0.4-r2","3.0.4-r3","3.0.4-r4","3.0.5-r0","3.0.5-r1","4.0.0-r0","4.0.0-r1","4.0.0-r2","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.2-r2","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.1.0-r0","4.1.0-r1","4.1.0-r2","4.1.1-r0","4.1.2-r0","4.1.2-r1","4.1.2-r2","4.1.2-r3","4.1.3-r0","5.1.2-r0","5.1.2-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-12425.json"}},{"package":{"name":"varnish","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/varnish?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.1.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.1.5-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.0-r2","3.0.2-r0","3.0.2-r1","3.0.2-r2","3.0.2-r3","3.0.2-r4","3.0.2-r5","3.0.2-r6","3.0.2-r7","3.0.3-r0","3.0.3-r1","3.0.3-r2","3.0.4-r0","3.0.4-r1","3.0.4-r2","3.0.4-r3","3.0.4-r4","3.0.5-r0","3.0.5-r1","4.0.0-r0","4.0.0-r1","4.0.0-r2","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.2-r2","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.1.0-r0","4.1.0-r1","4.1.0-r2","4.1.1-r0","4.1.2-r0","4.1.2-r1","4.1.2-r2","4.1.2-r3","4.1.3-r0","5.1.2-r0","5.1.2-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-12425.json"}},{"package":{"name":"varnish","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/varnish?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.1.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.1.5-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.0-r2","3.0.2-r0","3.0.2-r1","3.0.2-r2","3.0.2-r3","3.0.2-r4","3.0.2-r5","3.0.2-r6","3.0.2-r7","3.0.3-r0","3.0.3-r1","3.0.3-r2","3.0.4-r0","3.0.4-r1","3.0.4-r2","3.0.4-r3","3.0.4-r4","3.0.5-r0","3.0.5-r1","4.0.0-r0","4.0.0-r1","4.0.0-r2","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.2-r2","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.1.0-r0","4.1.0-r1","4.1.0-r2","4.1.1-r0","4.1.2-r0","4.1.2-r1","4.1.2-r2","4.1.2-r3","4.1.3-r0","5.1.2-r0","5.1.2-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-12425.json"}},{"package":{"name":"varnish","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/varnish?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.1.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.1.5-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.0-r2","3.0.2-r0","3.0.2-r1","3.0.2-r2","3.0.2-r3","3.0.2-r4","3.0.2-r5","3.0.2-r6","3.0.2-r7","3.0.3-r0","3.0.3-r1","3.0.3-r2","3.0.4-r0","3.0.4-r1","3.0.4-r2","3.0.4-r3","3.0.4-r4","3.0.5-r0","3.0.5-r1","4.0.0-r0","4.0.0-r1","4.0.0-r2","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.2-r2","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.1.0-r0","4.1.0-r1","4.1.0-r2","4.1.1-r0","4.1.2-r0","4.1.2-r1","4.1.2-r2","4.1.2-r3","4.1.3-r0","5.1.2-r0","5.1.2-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-12425.json"}},{"package":{"name":"varnish","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/varnish?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.1.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.1.5-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.0-r2","3.0.2-r0","3.0.2-r1","3.0.2-r2","3.0.2-r3","3.0.2-r4","3.0.2-r5","3.0.2-r6","3.0.2-r7","3.0.3-r0","3.0.3-r1","3.0.3-r2","3.0.4-r0","3.0.4-r1","3.0.4-r2","3.0.4-r3","3.0.4-r4","3.0.5-r0","3.0.5-r1","4.0.0-r0","4.0.0-r1","4.0.0-r2","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.2-r2","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.1.0-r0","4.1.0-r1","4.1.0-r2","4.1.1-r0","4.1.2-r0","4.1.2-r1","4.1.2-r2","4.1.2-r3","4.1.3-r0","5.1.2-r0","5.1.2-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-12425.json"}},{"package":{"name":"varnish","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/varnish?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.1.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.1.5-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.0-r2","3.0.2-r0","3.0.2-r1","3.0.2-r2","3.0.2-r3","3.0.2-r4","3.0.2-r5","3.0.2-r6","3.0.2-r7","3.0.3-r0","3.0.3-r1","3.0.3-r2","3.0.4-r0","3.0.4-r1","3.0.4-r2","3.0.4-r3","3.0.4-r4","3.0.5-r0","3.0.5-r1","4.0.0-r0","4.0.0-r1","4.0.0-r2","4.0.1-r0","4.0.2-r0","4.0.2-r1","4.0.2-r2","4.0.3-r0","4.0.3-r1","4.1.0-r0","4.1.0-r1","4.1.0-r2","4.1.1-r0","4.1.2-r0","4.1.2-r1","4.1.2-r2","4.1.2-r3","4.1.3-r0","5.1.2-r0","5.1.2-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-12425.json"}},{"package":{"name":"varnish","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/varnish?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.1.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.1.5-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.0-r2","3.0.2-r0","3.0.2-r1","3.0.2-r2","3.0.2-r3","3.0.2-r4","3.0.2-r5","3.0.2-r6
