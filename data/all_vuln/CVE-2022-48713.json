  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf/x86/intel/pt: Fix crash with stop filters in single-range mode\n\nAdd a check for !buf->single before calling pt_buffer_region_size in a\nplace where a missing check can cause a kernel crash.\n\nFixes a bug introduced by commit 670638477aed (\"perf/x86/intel/pt:\nOpportunistically use single range output mode\"), which added a\nsupport for PT single-range output mode. Since that commit if a PT\nstop filter range is hit while tracing, the kernel will crash because\nof a null pointer dereference in pt_handle_status due to calling\npt_buffer_region_size without a ToPA configured.\n\nThe commit which introduced single-range mode guarded almost all uses of\nthe ToPA buffer variables with checks of the buf->single variable, but\nmissed the case where tracing was stopped by the PT hardware, which\nhappens when execution hits a configured stop filter.\n\nTested that hitting a stop filter while PT recording successfully\nrecords a trace with this patch but crashes without this patch.",
