This private wildcard matching function would match IDN (International Domain Name) hosts incorrectly and could as a result accept patterns that otherwise should mismatch. IDN hostnames are converted to puny code before used for certificate checks. Puny coded names always start with `xn--` and should not be allowed to pattern match, but the wildcard check in curl could still check for `x*`, which would match even though the IDN name most likely contained nothing even resembling an `x`.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/curl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.74.0-1.3+deb11u9"}]}],"versions":["7.74.0-1.3","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u1","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u2","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u3","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u4","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u5","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u6","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u7","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u7~bpo11+1","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u8"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-28321.json"}},{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/curl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.88.1-10"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-28321.json"}},{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/curl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.88.1-10"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-28321.json"}},{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/curl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.88.1-10"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-28321.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-28321"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
