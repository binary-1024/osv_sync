  "details": "Wireshark is an open source tool for profiling network traffic and analyzing packets. Such a tool is often referred to as a network analyzer, network protocol analyzer or sniffer.  Wireshark, formerly known as Ethereal, can be used to examine the details of traffic at a variety of levels ranging from connection-level information to the bits that make up a single packet. Packet capture can provide a network administrator with information about individual packets such as transmit time, source, destination, protocol type and header data. This information can be useful for evaluating security events and troubleshooting network security device issues.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nIn Wireshark 3.2.0 to 3.2.1, 3.0.0 to 3.0.8, and 2.6.0 to 2.6.14, the LTE RRC dissector could leak memory. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-lte-rrc.c by adjusting certain append operations.(CVE-2020-9431)\r\n\r\nIn Wireshark 3.2.0 to 3.2.1, 3.0.0 to 3.0.8, and 2.6.0 to 2.6.14, the EAP dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-eap.c by using more careful sscanf parsing.(CVE-2020-9428)\r\n\r\nIn Wireshark 3.0.0 to 3.0.6 and 2.6.0 to 2.6.12, the CMS dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/asn1/cms/packet-cms-template.c by ensuring that an object identifier is set to NULL after a ContentInfo dissection.(CVE-2019-19553)\r\n\r\nIn Wireshark 3.0.0 to 3.0.2, 2.6.0 to 2.6.9, and 2.4.0 to 2.4.15, the ASN.1 BER dissector and related dissectors could crash. This was addressed in epan/asn1.c by properly restricting buffer increments.(CVE-2019-13619)",
