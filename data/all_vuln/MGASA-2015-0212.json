  "details": "Updated async-http-client packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nIt was found that async-http-client would disable SSL/TLS certificate\nverification under certain conditions, for example if HTTPS communication also\nuses client certificates. This can be exploited by a Man-in-the-middle (MITM)\nattack where the attacker can spoof a valid certificate (CVE-2013-7397).\n\nIt was found that async-http-client did not verify that the server hostname\nmatched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName\nfield in X.509 certificates. This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to\nspoof an SSL server if they had a certificate that was valid for any domain\nname (CVE-2013-7398).\n",
