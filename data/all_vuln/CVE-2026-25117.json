Prior to commit e33da14449a5abcff507e554f66e2141d6683b0a, missing sandboxing on `/workspace/*` routes allows challenge authors to inject arbitrary javascript which runs on the same origin as `http[:]//dojo[.]website`. This is a sandbox escape leading to arbitrary javascript execution as the dojo's origin. A challenge author can craft a page that executes any dangerous actions that the user could. Version e33da14449a5abcff507e554f66e2141d6683b0a patches the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pwncollege/dojo","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e33da14449a5abcff507e554f66e2141d6683b0a"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-25117.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/25xxx/CVE-2026-25117.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/pwncollege/dojo/commit/e33da14449a5abcff507e554f66e2141d6683b0a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/pwncollege/dojo/security/advisories/GHSA-wvcf-9xm8-7mrg"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-25117"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-20","CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/25xxx/CVE-2026-25117.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:L/VA:N/SC:H/SI:L/SA:N"}]}
