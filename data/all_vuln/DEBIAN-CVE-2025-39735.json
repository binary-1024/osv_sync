{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-39735","published":"2025-04-18T07:15:44Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:20:28.038262Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-39735"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  jfs: fix slab-out-of-bounds read in ea_get()  During the \"size_check\" label in ea_get(), the code checks if the extended attribute list (xattr) size matches ea_size. If not, it logs \"ea_get: invalid extended attribute\" and calls print_hex_dump().  Here, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr) returns 4110417968, which exceeds INT_MAX (2,147,483,647). Then ea_size is clamped:  \tint size = clamp_t(int, ea_size, 0, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr));  Although clamp_t aims to bound ea_size between 0 and 4110417968, the upper limit is treated as an int, causing an overflow above 2^31 - 1. This leads \"size\" to wrap around and become negative (-184549328).  The \"size\" is then passed to print_hex_dump() (called \"len\" in print_hex_dump()), it is passed as type size_t (an unsigned type), this is then stored inside a variable called \"int remaining\", which is then assigned to \"int linelen\" which is then passed to hex_dump_to_buffer(). In print_hex_dump() the for loop, iterates through 0 to len-1, where len is 18446744073525002176, calling hex_dump_to_buffer() on each iteration:  \tfor (i = 0; i < len; i += rowsize) { \t\tlinelen = min(remaining, rowsize); \t\tremaining -= rowsize;  \t\thex_dump_to_buffer(ptr + i, linelen, rowsize, groupsize, \t\t\t\t   linebuf, sizeof(linebuf), ascii);  \t\t... \t}  The expected stopping condition (i < len) is effectively broken since len is corrupted and very large. This eventually leads to the \"ptr+i\" being passed to hex_dump_to_buffer() to get closer to the end of the actual bounds of \"ptr\", eventually an out of bounds access is done in hex_dump_to_buffer() in the following for loop:  \tfor (j = 0; j < len; j++) { \t\t\tif (linebuflen < lx + 2) \t\t\t\tgoto overflow2; \t\t\tch = ptr[j]; \t\t... \t}  To fix this we should validate \"EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr)\" before it is utilised.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.237-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.103-1","5.10.103-1~bpo10+1","5.10.106-1","5.10.113-1","5.10.120-1","5.10.120-1~bpo10+1","5.10.127-1","5.10.127-2","5.10.127-2~bpo10+1","5.10.136-1","5.10.140-1","5.10.148-1","5.10.149-1","5.10.149-2","5.10.158-1","5.10.158-2","5.10.162-1","5.10.178-1","5.10.178-2","5.10.178-3","5.10.179-1","5.10.179-2","5.10.179-3","5.10.179-4","5.10.179-5","5.10.191-1","5.10.197-1","5.10.205-1","5.10.205-2","5.10.209-1","5.10.209-2","5.10.216-1","5.10.218-1","5.10.221-1","5.10.223-1","5.10.226-1","5.10.234-1","5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1","5.10.92-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-39735.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.135-1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.106-1","6.1.106-2","6.1.106-3","6.1.112-1","6.1.115-1","6.1.119-1","6.1.123-1","6.1.124-1","6.1.128-1","6.1.129-1","6.1.133-1","6.1.27-1","6.1.37-1","6.1.38-1","6.1.38-2","6.1.38-2~bpo11+1","6.1.38-3","6.1.38-4","6.1.38-4~bpo11+1","6.1.52-1","6.1.55-1","6.1.55-1~bpo11+1","6.1.64-1","6.1.66-1","6.1.67-1","6.1.69-1","6.1.69-1~bpo11+1","6.1.76-1","6.1.76-1~bpo11+1","6.1.82-1","6.1.85-1","6.1.90-1","6.1.90-1~bpo11+1","6.1.94-1","6.1.94-1~bpo11+1","6.1.98-1","6.1.99-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-39735.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.25-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-39735.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.25-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-39735.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux-6.1","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-6.1?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.137-1~deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.106-3~deb11u1","6.1.106-3~deb11u2","6.1.106-3~deb11u3","6.1.112-1~deb11u1","6.1.119-1~deb11u1","6.1.128-1~deb11u1","6.1.129-1~deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-39735.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-39735"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"}]}
