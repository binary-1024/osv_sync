A crafted input file that is processed by OpenEXR could cause a shift overflow in the FastHufDecoder, potentially leading to problems with application availability.(CVE-2021-3474)\r\n\r\nThere&apos;s a flaw in OpenEXR&apos;s deep tile sample size calculations in versions before 3.0.0-beta. An attacker who is able to submit a crafted file to be processed by OpenEXR could trigger an integer overflow, subsequently leading to an out-of-bounds read. The greatest risk of this flaw is to application availability.(CVE-2021-3477)\r\n\r\nThere is a flaw in OpenEXR in versions before 3.0.0-beta. An attacker who can submit a crafted file to be processed by OpenEXR could cause an integer overflow, potentially leading to problems with application availability.(CVE-2021-3475)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in OpenEXR in versions before 3.0.0-beta. A crafted input file supplied by an attacker, that is processed by the Dwa decompression functionality of OpenEXR&apos;s IlmImf library, could cause a NULL pointer dereference. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-20296)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in OpenEXR&apos;s B44 uncompression functionality in versions before 3.0.0-beta.
