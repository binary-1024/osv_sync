  "summary": "Updated libssh packages fix security vulnerability",
  "details": "A flaw has been found in libssh in versions prior to 0.9.6. The SSH\nprotocol keeps track of two shared secrets during the lifetime of the\nsession. One of them is called secret_hash and the other session_id.\nInitially, both of them are the same, but after key re-exchange, previous\nsession_id is kept and used as an input to new secret_hash. Historically,\nboth of these buffers had shared length variable, which worked as long as\nthese buffers were same. But the key re-exchange operation can also change\nthe key exchange method, which can be based on hash of different size,\neventually creating \"secret_hash\" of different size than the session_id\nhas. This becomes an issue when the session_id memory is zeroed or when it\nis used again during second key re-exchange. (CVE-2021-3634)\n",
