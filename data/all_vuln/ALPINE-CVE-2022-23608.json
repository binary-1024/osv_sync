{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2022-23608","published":"2022-02-22T20:15:07.693Z","modified":"2025-11-19T06:19:51.475586Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-23608"],"details":"PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In versions up to and including 2.11.1 when in a dialog set (or forking) scenario, a hash key shared by multiple UAC dialogs can potentially be prematurely freed when one of the dialogs is destroyed . The issue may cause a dialog set to be registered in the hash table multiple times (with different hash keys) leading to undefined behavior such as dialog list collision which eventually leading to endless loop. A patch is available in commit db3235953baa56d2fb0e276ca510fefca751643f which will be included in the next release. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"pjproject","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/pjproject?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.12-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.1-r0","1.10-r0","1.4-r0","1.4-r1","1.6-r0","1.6-r1","1.6-r2","2.0-r0","2.1-r0","2.11-r0","2.11.1-r0","2.11.1-r1","2.11.1-r2","2.2-r0","2.2.1-r0","2.3-r0","2.4-r0","2.4.5-r0","2.5.5-r0","2.5.5-r1","2.5.5-r2","2.5.5-r3","2.5.5-r4","2.7.2-r0","2.7.2-r1","2.7.2-r2","2.7.2-r3","2.7.2-r4","2.8-r0","2.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-23608.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pjproject","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/pjproject?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.12-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.1-r0","1.10-r0","1.4-r0","1.4-r1","1.6-r0","1.6-r1","1.6-r2","2.0-r0","2.1-r0","2.11-r0","2.11.1-r0","2.11.1-r1","2.11.1-r2","2.2-r0","2.2.1-r0","2.3-r0","2.4-r0","2.4.5-r0","2.5.5-r0","2.5.5-r1","2.5.5-r2","2.5.5-r3","2.5.5-r4","2.7.2-r0","2.7.2-r1","2.7.2-r2","2.7.2-r3","2.7.2-r4","2.8-r0","2.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-23608.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pjproject","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/pjproject?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.12-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.1-r0","1.10-r0","1.4-r0","1.4-r1","1.6-r0","1.6-r1","1.6-r2","2.0-r0","2.1-r0","2.11-r0","2.11.1-r0","2.11.1-r1","2.11.1-r2","2.2-r0","2.2.1-r0","2.3-r0","2.4-r0","2.4.5-r0","2.5.5-r0","2.5.5-r1","2.5.5-r2","2.5.5-r3","2.5.5-r4","2.7.2-r0","2.7.2-r1","2.7.2-r2","2.7.2-r3","2.7.2-r4","2.8-r0","2.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-23608.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pjproject","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/pjproject?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.12-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.1-r0","1.10-r0","1.4-r0","1.4-r1","1.6-r0","1.6-r1","1.6-r2","2.0-r0","2.1-r0","2.11-r0","2.11.1-r0","2.11.1-r1","2.11.1-r2","2.2-r0","2.2.1-r0","2.3-r0","2.4-r0","2.4.5-r0","2.5.5-r0","2.5.5-r1","2.5.5-r2","2.5.5-r3","2.5.5-r4","2.7.2-r0","2.7.2-r1","2.7.2-r2","2.7.2-r3","2.7.2-r4","2.8-r0","2.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-23608.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pjproject","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/pjproject?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.12-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.1-r0","1.10-r0","1.4-r0","1.4-r1","1.6-r0","1.6-r1","1.6-r2","2.0-r0","2.1-r0","2.11-r0","2.11.1-r0","2.11.1-r1","2.11.1-r2","2.2-r0","2.2.1-r0","2.3-r0","2.4-r0","2.4.5-r0","2.5.5-r0","2.5.5-r1","2.5.5-r2","2.5.5-r3","2.5.5-r4","2.7.2-r0","2.7.2-r1","2.7.2-r2","2.7.2-r3","2.7.2-r4","2.8-r0","2.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-23608.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pjproject","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/pjproject?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.12-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.1-r0","1.10-r0","1.4-r0","1.4-r1","1.6-r0","1.6-r1","1.6-r2","2.0-r0","2.1-r0","2.11-r0","2.11.1-r0","2.11.1-r1","2.11.1-r2","2.2-r0","2.2.1-r0","2.3-r0","2.4-r0","2.4.5-r0","2.5.5-r0","2.5.5-r1","2.5.5-r2","2.5.5-r3","2.5.5-r4","2.7.2-r0","2.7.2-r1","2.7.2-r2","2.7.2-r3","2.7.2-r4","2.8-r0","2.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-23608.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pjproject","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/pjproject?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.12-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.1-r0","1.10-r0","1.4-r0","1.4-r1","1.6-r0","1.6-r1","1.6-r2","2.0-r0","2.1-r0","2.11-r0","2.11.1-r0","2.11.1-r1","2.11.1-r2","2.2-r0","2.2.1-r0","2.3-r0","2.4-r0","2.4.5-r0","2.5.5-r0","2.5.5-r1","2.5.5-r2","2.5.5-r3","2.5.5-r4","2.7.2-r0","2.7.2-r1","2.7.2-r2","2.7.2-r3","2.7.2-r4","2.8-r0","2.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-23608.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2022-23608"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
