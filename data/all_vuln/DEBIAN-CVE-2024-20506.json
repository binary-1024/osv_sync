An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if they replace the ClamD log file with a symlink to a critical system file and then find a way to restart the ClamD process. An exploit could allow the attacker to corrupt a critical system file by appending ClamD log messages after restart.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"clamav","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/clamav?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.7+dfsg-1~deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["0.103.10+dfsg-0+deb11u1","0.103.2+dfsg-2","0.103.3+dfsg-0+deb11u1","0.103.3+dfsg-1","0.103.4+dfsg-0+deb11u1","0.103.4+dfsg-1","0.103.5+dfsg-0+deb11u1","0.103.5+dfsg-1","0.103.6+dfsg-0+deb11u1","0.103.6+dfsg-1","0.103.7+dfsg-0+deb11u1","0.103.7+dfsg-1","0.103.8+dfsg-0+deb11u1","0.103.9+dfsg-0+deb11u1","1.0.0+dfsg-1","1.0.0+dfsg-2","1.0.0+dfsg-3","1.0.0+dfsg-4","1.0.0+dfsg-5","1.0.0+dfsg-6","1.0.1+dfsg-1","1.0.1+dfsg-2","1.0.2+dfsg-1","1.0.2+dfsg-1~deb12u1","1.0.3+dfsg-1","1.0.3+dfsg-1~deb12u1","1.0.3+dfsg-2","1.0.4+dfsg-1","1.0.5+dfsg-1","1.0.5+dfsg-1.1","1.0.5+dfsg-1~deb12u1","1.0.6+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-20506.json"}},{"package":{"name":"clamav","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/clamav?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.7+dfsg-1~deb12u1"}]}],"versions":["1.0.1+dfsg-2","1.0.2+dfsg-1","1.0.2+dfsg-1~deb12u1","1.0.3+dfsg-1","1.0.3+dfsg-1~deb12u1","1.0.3+dfsg-2","1.0.4+dfsg-1","1.0.5+dfsg-1","1.0.5+dfsg-1.1","1.0.5+dfsg-1~deb12u1","1.0.6+dfsg-1","1.0.7+dfsg-1~deb11u1","1.0.7+dfsg-1~deb11u2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-20506.json"}},{"package":{"name":"clamav","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/clamav?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.1+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-20506.json"}},{"package":{"name":"clamav","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/clamav?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.1+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-20506.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-20506"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H"}]}
