{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-22243","published":"2026-01-28T16:05:35.641Z","modified":"2026-01-28T19:51:23.778782Z","summary":"EGroupware has SQL Injection in Nextmatch Filter Processing","details":"EGroupware is a Web based groupware server written in PHP. A SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the core components of EGroupware prior to versions 23.1.20260113 and 26.0.20260113, specifically in the `Nextmatch` filter processing. The flaw allows authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands into the `WHERE` clause of database queries. This is achieved by exploiting a PHP type juggling issue where JSON decoding converts numeric strings into integers, bypassing the `is_int()` security check used by the application. Versions 23.1.20260113 and 26.0.20260113 patch the vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/egroupware/egroupware","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"10dc43ea51de70f2bd010bb2fc6b5b7ed957254c"},{"fixed":"dd32c4f5fadcc0fcc17a4c64233492143ecd2a40"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"23.1.20260113"},{"fixed":"26.0.20260113"}]}}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22243.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22243.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/EGroupware/egroupware/releases/tag/23.1.20260113"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/EGroupware/egroupware/releases/tag/26.0.20260113"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/EGroupware/egroupware/security/advisories/GHSA-rvxj-7f72-mhrx"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22243"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-89"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22243.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
