{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-40970","published":"2024-07-12T13:15:18.687Z","modified":"2026-01-05T17:10:46.171929Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-40970"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Avoid hw_desc array overrun in dw-axi-dmac  I have a use case where nr_buffers = 3 and in which each descriptor is composed by 3 segments, resulting in the DMA channel descs_allocated to be 9. Since axi_desc_put() handles the hw_desc considering the descs_allocated, this scenario would result in a kernel panic (hw_desc array will be overrun).  To fix this, the proposal is to add a new member to the axi_dma_desc structure, where we keep the number of allocated hw_descs (axi_desc_alloc()) and use it in axi_desc_put() to handle the hw_desc array correctly.  Additionally I propose to remove the axi_chan_start_first_queued() call after completing the transfer, since it was identified that unbalance can occur (started descriptors can be interrupted and transfer ignored due to DMA channel not being enabled).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.99-1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.27-1","6.1.37-1","6.1.38-1","6.1.38-2","6.1.38-2~bpo11+1","6.1.38-3","6.1.38-4","6.1.38-4~bpo11+1","6.1.52-1","6.1.55-1","6.1.55-1~bpo11+1","6.1.64-1","6.1.66-1","6.1.67-1","6.1.69-1","6.1.69-1~bpo11+1","6.1.76-1","6.1.76-1~bpo11+1","6.1.82-1","6.1.85-1","6.1.90-1","6.1.90-1~bpo11+1","6.1.94-1","6.1.94-1~bpo11+1","6.1.98-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-40970.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.9.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-40970.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.9.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-40970.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux-6.1","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-6.1?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.119-1~deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.106-3~deb11u1","6.1.106-3~deb11u2","6.1.106-3~deb11u3","6.1.112-1~deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-40970.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-40970"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
