{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47775","published":"2024-12-12T02:03:40Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:19:39.210866Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-47775"],"details":"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read vulnerability has been found in the parse_ds64 function within gstwavparse.c. The parse_ds64 function does not check that the buffer buf contains sufficient data before attempting to read from it, doing multiple GST_READ_UINT32_LE operations without performing boundary checks. This can lead to an OOB-read when buf is smaller than expected. This vulnerability allows reading beyond the bounds of the data buffer, potentially leading to a crash (denial of service) or the leak of sensitive data. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-good1.0","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gst-plugins-good1.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.18.4-2+deb11u3"}]}],"versions":["1.18.4-2","1.18.4-2+deb11u1","1.18.4-2+deb11u2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47775.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-good1.0","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gst-plugins-good1.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.22.0-5+deb12u2"}]}],"versions":["1.22.0-5","1.22.0-5+deb12u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47775.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-good1.0","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gst-plugins-good1.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.24.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47775.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-good1.0","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gst-plugins-good1.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.24.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47775.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-47775"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"}]}
