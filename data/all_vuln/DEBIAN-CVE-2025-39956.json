{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-39956","published":"2025-10-09T10:15:36Z","modified":"2025-11-15T13:10:15.601474Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-39956"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  igc: don't fail igc_probe() on LED setup error  When igc_led_setup() fails, igc_probe() fails and triggers kernel panic in free_netdev() since unregister_netdev() is not called. [1] This behavior can be tested using fault-injection framework, especially the failslab feature. [2]  Since LED support is not mandatory, treat LED setup failures as non-fatal and continue probe with a warning message, consequently avoiding the kernel panic.
