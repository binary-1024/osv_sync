  "summary": "Updated kernel packages fix security vulnerabilities",
  "details": "This kernel update is based on upstream 5.15.65 and fixes at least the\nfollowing security issues:\n\nAn out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in the Linux kernel's BPF\nsubsystem in how a user calls the bpf_tail_call function with a key\nlarger than the max_entries of the map. This flaw allows a local user\nto gain unauthorized access to data (CVE-2022-2905).\n\nA race condition was found in the Linux kernel's IP framework for\ntransforming packets (XFRM subsystem) when multiple calls to\nxfrm_probe_algs occurred simultaneously. This flaw could allow a local\nattacker to potentially trigger an out-of-bounds write or leak kernel\nheap memory by performing an out-of-bounds read and copying it into a\nsocket (CVE-2022-3028).\n\nThere exists a use-after-free in io_uring in the Linux kernel.\nSignalfd_poll() and binder_poll() use a waitqueue whose lifetime is the\ncurrent task. It will send a POLLFREE notification to all waiters before\nthe queue is freed. Unfortunately, the io_uring poll doesn't handle\nPOLLFREE. This allows a use-after-free to occur if a signalfd or binder\nfd is polled with io_uring poll, and the waitqueue gets freed\n(CVE-2022-3176).\n\nAn issue was discovered in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c in the kernel\nbefore 5.19.6. A denial of service can occur upon binding to an already\nbound chain (CVE-2022-39190).\n\nmm/rmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.19.7 has a use-after-free related\nto leaf anon_vma double reuse (CVE-2022-42703).\n\nOther fixes in this update:\n- A fix for an issue causing excessive logging (mga#30779) due to an\n  uppstream change that was included in the 5.15.62 kernel update released\n  as MGASA-2022-0305.\n- bpf, cgroup: Fix kernel BUG in purge_effective_progs\n- bpf: Restrict bpf_sys_bpf to CAP_PERFMON\n- Revert \"xhci: turn off port power in shutdown\" as it causes some systems\n  to hang on shutdown.\n\nFor other upstream fixes in this update, see the referenced changelogs.\n",
