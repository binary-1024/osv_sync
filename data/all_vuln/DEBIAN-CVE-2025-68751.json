An inline assembly instruction 'vstl' can write varied amount of bytes depending on value of 'index' argument. If 'index' > 0, 'vstl' writes at least 2 bytes.  clang generates kmsan write helper call depending on inline assembly constraints. Constraints are evaluated compile-time, but value of 'index' argument is known only at runtime.  clang currently generates call to __msan_instrument_asm_store with 1 byte as size. Manually call kmsan function to indicate correct amount of bytes written and fix false-positive report.  This change fixes following kmsan reports:  [   36.563119] ===================================================== [   36.563594] BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in virtqueue_add+0x35c6/0x7c70 [   36.563852]
