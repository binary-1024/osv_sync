Versions 3.13.2 and below of the Python HTTP parser may allow a request smuggling attack with the presence of non-ASCII characters. If a pure Python version of AIOHTTP is installed (i.e. without the usual C extensions) or AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS is enabled, then an attacker may be able to execute a request smuggling attack to bypass certain firewalls or proxy protections. This issue is fixed in version 3.13.3.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-aiohttp","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-aiohttp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.10.0-1","3.10.1-1","3.10.10-1","3.10.10-2","3.10.11-1","3.10.3-1","3.10.3-2","3.10.3-3","3.10.4-1","3.10.5-1","3.10.6-1","3.10.8-1","3.11.15-1","3.11.16-1","3.12.15-1","3.13.0-1","3.13.1-1","3.13.3-1","3.13.3-2","3.13.3-3","3.7.4-1","3.7.4-1+deb11u1","3.7.4-2","3.8.1-1","3.8.1-2","3.8.1-3","3.8.1-4","3.8.1-5","3.8.3-1","3.8.4-1","3.8.5-1","3.8.6-1","3.9.1-1","3.9.5-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-69224.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-aiohttp","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-aiohttp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.10.0-1","3.10.1-1","3.10.10-1","3.10.10-2","3.10.11-1","3.10.3-1","3.10.3-2","3.10.3-3","3.10.4-1","3.10.5-1","3.10.6-1","3.10.8-1","3.11.15-1","3.11.16-1","3.12.15-1","3.13.0-1","3.13.1-1","3.13.3-1","3.13.3-2","3.13.3-3","3.8.4-1","3.8.4-1+deb12u1","3.8.5-1","3.8.6-1","3.9.1-1","3.9.5-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-69224.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-aiohttp","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-aiohttp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.11.16-1","3.12.15-1","3.13.0-1","3.13.1-1","3.13.3-1","3.13.3-2","3.13.3-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-69224.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-aiohttp","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-aiohttp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.13.3-1"}]}],"versions":["3.11.16-1","3.12.15-1","3.13.0-1","3.13.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-69224.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-69224"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
