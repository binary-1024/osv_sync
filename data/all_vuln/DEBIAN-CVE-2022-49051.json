  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: usb: aqc111: Fix out-of-bounds accesses in RX fixup  aqc111_rx_fixup() contains several out-of-bounds accesses that can be triggered by a malicious (or defective) USB device, in particular:   - The metadata array (desc_offset..desc_offset+2*pkt_count) can be out of bounds,    causing OOB reads and (on big-endian systems) OOB endianness flips.  - A packet can overlap the metadata array, causing a later OOB    endianness flip to corrupt data used by a cloned SKB that has already    been handed off into the network stack.  - A packet SKB can be constructed whose tail is far beyond its end,    causing out-of-bounds heap data to be considered part of the SKB's    data.  Found doing variant analysis. Tested it with another driver (ax88179_178a), since I don't have a aqc111 device to test it, but the code looks very similar.",
