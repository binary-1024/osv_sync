  "details": "Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser, designed for standards compliance, performance and portability.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA permission leak could have occurred from a trusted site to an untrusted site via `embed` or `object` elements. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 132, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.4, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.17, Thunderbird &lt; 128.4, and Thunderbird &lt; 132.(CVE-2024-10458)\r\n\r\nAn attacker could have caused a use-after-free when accessibility was enabled, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 132, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.4, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.17, Thunderbird &lt; 128.4, and Thunderbird &lt; 132.(CVE-2024-10459)\r\n\r\nThe origin of an external protocol handler prompt could have been obscured using a data: URL within an `iframe`. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 132, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.4, Thunderbird &lt; 128.4, and Thunderbird &lt; 132.(CVE-2024-10460)\r\n\r\nIn multipart/x-mixed-replace responses, `Content-Disposition: attachment` in the response header was not respected and did not force a download, which could allow XSS attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 132, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.4, Thunderbird &lt; 128.4, and Thunderbird &lt; 132.(CVE-2024-10461)\r\n\r\nTruncation of a long URL could have allowed origin spoofing in a permission prompt. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 132, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.4, Thunderbird &lt; 128.4, and Thunderbird &lt; 132.(CVE-2024-10462)\r\n\r\nVideo frames could have been leaked between origins in some situations. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 132, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.4, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.17, Thunderbird &lt; 128.4, and Thunderbird &lt; 132.(CVE-2024-10463)\r\n\r\nRepeated writes to history interface attributes could have been used to cause a Denial of Service condition in the browser. This was addressed by introducing rate-limiting to this API. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 132, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.4, Thunderbird &lt; 128.4, and Thunderbird &lt; 132.(CVE-2024-10464)\r\n\r\nA clipboard &quot;paste&quot; button could persist across tabs which allowed a spoofing attack. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 132, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.4, Thunderbird &lt; 128.4, and Thunderbird &lt; 132.(CVE-2024-10465)\r\n\r\nBy sending a specially crafted push message, a remote server could have hung the parent process, causing the browser to become unresponsive. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 132, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.4, Thunderbird &lt; 128.4, and Thunderbird &lt; 132.(CVE-2024-10466)\r\n\r\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 131, Firefox ESR 128.3, and Thunderbird 128.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 132, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.4, Thunderbird &lt; 128.4, and Thunderbird &lt; 132.(CVE-2024-10467)",
