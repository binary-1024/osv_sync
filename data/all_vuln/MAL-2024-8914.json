It has a limited risk.\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (0d59708de6a93515ddf3dce03f6051e168f3b881c22274793c91c2d646617a51)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'artifact-lab-3-package-4c04b1a2' @ 1.0.3 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package-4c04b1a2","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-4c04b1a2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-4c04b1a2/MAL-2024-8914.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package-4c04b1a2"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-09-19T23:05:29.37158436Z","modified_time":"2024-09-19T22:51:37Z","sha256":"0d59708de6a93515ddf3dce03f6051e168f3b881c22274793c91c2d646617a51","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["1.0.3"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-4c04b1a2","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.923474078Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"37e4e2b21c3950495a9aa6629b566b4ee61fdb2f2cd9e1ac3cf754e101394ac5","source":"kam193"}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
