This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/tainacan/tainacan","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8468fb4ec76c709d5ae2852d1fc64986b1dc73cf"}]}],"versions":["0.1","0.10","0.11","0.12","0.13","0.13.1","0.14","0.14.1","0.14.2","0.15","0.15.1","0.15.2","0.16","0.16.1","0.16.2","0.16.3","0.17","0.17.1","0.17.2","0.17.3","0.17.4","0.18","0.18.1","0.18.10","0.18.2","0.18.3","0.18.4","0.18.5","0.18.6","0.18.7","0.18.8","0.18.9","0.19","0.19.1","0.19.2","0.19.3","0.2","0.20.0","0.20.1","0.20.2","0.20.3","0.20.4","0.20.5","0.20.6","0.20.7","0.20.8","0.21.0","0.21.0RC","0.21.1","0.21.10","0.21.11","0.21.12","0.21.13","0.21.14","0.21.15","0.21.16","0.21.2","0.21.3","0.21.4","0.21.5","0.21.6","0.21.7","0.21.8","0.21.9","0.3","0.4","0.4.1","0.5","0.6","0.6.1","0.7","0.8","0.8.1","0.9","0.9.1","1.0.0","1.0.0-RC","1.0.0-RC2","1.0.0-RC3","1.0.0-RC4","security-adjustment"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-12746.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/tainacan/tainacan/blob/2491612ee9d5b14baa70862ba2308ee925de0938/src/classes/theme-helper/template-tags.php#L1652"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3395909/tainacan/trunk/classes/theme-helper/template-tags.php"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/014dd0ee-0bd0-477c-a0fa-bde8ce5a099c?source=cve"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/tainacan/tainacan/commit/8468fb4ec76c709d5ae2852d1fc64986b1dc73cf"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
