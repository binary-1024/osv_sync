  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Reapply \"drm/qxl: simplify qxl_fence_wait\"  This reverts commit 07ed11afb68d94eadd4ffc082b97c2331307c5ea.  Stephen Rostedt reports:  \"I went to run my tests on my VMs and the tests hung on boot up.   Unfortunately, the most I ever got out was:    [   93.607888] Testing event system initcall: OK   [   93.667730] Running tests on all trace events:   [   93.669757] Testing all events: OK   [   95.631064] ------------[ cut here ]------------   Timed out after 60 seconds\"  and further debugging points to a possible circular locking dependency between the console_owner locking and the worker pool locking.  Reverting the commit allows Steve's VM to boot to completion again.  [ This may obviously result in the \"[TTM] Buffer eviction failed\"   messages again, which was the reason for that original revert. But at   this point this seems preferable to a non-booting system... ]",
