These APIs include such foundational facilities as\nopen, read, write, malloc, printf, getaddrinfo, dlopen, pthread_create, crypt,\n login, exit and more.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nThe regcomp function in the GNU C library version from 2.4 to 2.41 is \nsubject to a double free if some previous allocation fails. It can be \naccomplished either by a malloc failure or by using an interposed malloc\n that injects random malloc failures. The double free can allow buffer \nmanipulation depending of how the regex is constructed.
