Path Traversal in the kustomize-controller via a malicious `kustomization.yaml` allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service at the controller level. Workarounds include automated tooling in the user's CI/CD pipeline to validate `kustomization.yaml` files conform with specific policies. This vulnerability is fixed in kustomize-controller v0.24.0 and included in flux2 v0.29.0. Users are recommended to upgrade.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"flux","ecosystem":"Bitnami","purl":"pkg:bitnami/flux"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.29.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/bitnami/vulndb/tree/main/data/flux/BIT-flux-2022-24878.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/security/advisories/GHSA-7pwf-jg34-hxwp"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24878"}],"database_specific":{"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:fluxcd:flux2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"severity":"Medium"}}
