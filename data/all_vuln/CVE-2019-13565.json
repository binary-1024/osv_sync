When using SASL authentication and session encryption, and relying on the SASL security layers in slapd access controls, it is possible to obtain access that would otherwise be denied via a simple bind for any identity covered in those ACLs. After the first SASL bind is completed, the sasl_ssf value is retained for all new non-SASL connections. Depending on the ACL configuration, this can affect different types of operations (searches, modifications, etc.). In other words, a successful authorization step completed by one user affects the authorization requirement for a different user.","references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00053.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00058.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Dec/26"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/08/msg00024.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Dec/23"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210788"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4078-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4078-2/"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://www.openldap.org/its/index.cgi/?findid=9052"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://www.openldap.org/lists/openldap-announce/201907/msg00001.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r1b103833cb5bc8466e24ff0ecc5e75b45a705334ab6a444e64e840a0%40%3Cissues.bookkeeper.apache.org%3E"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r58af02e294bd07f487e2c64ffc0a29b837db5600e33b6e698b9d696b%40%3Cissues.bookkeeper.apache.org%3E"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf4c02775860db415b4955778a131c2795223f61cb8c6a450893651e4%40%3Cissues.bookkeeper.apache.org%3E"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K98008862?utm_source=f5support&amp%3Butm_medium=RSS"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
