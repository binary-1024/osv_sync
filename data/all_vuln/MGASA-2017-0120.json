  "details": "An untrusted library search path flaw was found in the JCE component of\nOpenJDK. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to cause a Java\napplication using JCE to load an attacker-controlled library and hence\nescalate their privileges (CVE-2017-3511).\n\nIt was found that the JAXP component of OpenJDK failed to correctly\nenforce parse tree size limits when parsing XML document. An attacker able\nto make a Java application parse a specially crafted XML document could\nuse this flaw to make it consume an excessive amount of CPU and memory\n(CVE-2017-3526).\n\nIt was discovered that the HTTP client implementation in the Networking\ncomponent of OpenJDK could cache and re-use an NTLM authenticated\nconnection in a different security context. A remote attacker could\npossibly use this flaw to make a Java application perform HTTP requests\nauthenticated with credentials of a different user (CVE-2017-3509).\n\nNote: This update adds support for the \"jdk.ntlm.cache\" system property\nwhich, when set to false, prevents caching of NTLM connections and\nauthentications and hence prevents this issue. However, caching remains\nenabled by default.\n\nIt was discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK did not allow\nusers to restrict the set of algorithms allowed for Jar integrity\nverification. This flaw could allow an attacker to modify content of the\nJar file that used weak signing key or hash algorithm (CVE-2017-3539).\n\nNote: This updates extends the fix for CVE-2016-5542 released as part of\nthe MGASA-2016-0359 advisory to no longer allow the MD5 hash algorithm\nduring the Jar integrity verification by adding it to the\njdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms security property.\n\nNewline injection flaws were discovered in FTP and SMTP client\nimplementations in the Networking component in OpenJDK. A remote attacker\ncould possibly use these flaws to manipulate FTP or SMTP connections\nestablished by a Java application (CVE-2017-3533, CVE-2017-3544).\n",
