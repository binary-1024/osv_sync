  "details": "Valkey is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets.  You can run atomic operations on these types, like appending to a string; incrementing the value in a hash; pushing to a list; computing set intersection, union and difference; or getting the member with highest ranking in a sorted set.  In order to achieve its outstanding performance, Valkey works with an in-memory dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.  Valkey also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave replication, with very fast non-blocking first synchronization, auto-reconnection on net split and so forth.  Other features include Transactions, Pub/Sub, Lua scripting, Keys with a limited time-to-live, and configuration settings to make Valkey behave like a cache.  You can use Valkey from most programming languages also.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* redis: Redis Stack Buffer Overflow (CVE-2025-27151)\n\n* redis: Redis Unauthenticated Denial of Service (CVE-2025-48367)\n\n* redis: Redis Hyperloglog Out-of-Bounds Write Vulnerability (CVE-2025-32023)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.",
