{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-3178","published":"2024-04-03T19:15:44.210Z","modified":"2026-01-09T19:14:17.836807Z","aliases":["GHSA-xwrh-qxmc-x8c8"],"details":"Concrete CMS versions 9 below 9.2.8 and versions below 8.5.16 are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in the Advanced File Search Filter. Prior to the fix, a rogue administrator could add malicious code in the file manager because of insufficient validation of administrator provided data. All administrators have access to the File Manager and hence could create a search filter with the malicious code attached. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.1 with a vector of  AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator .","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"17020e35940cdec1493c63065af6a2245e00d402"}]}],"versions":["5.7.0","5.7.0.1","5.7.0.3","5.7.0.4","5.7.1","5.7.2","5.7.2.1","5.7.3","5.7.3.1","5.7.4","5.7.4.1","5.7.4.2","5.7.5","5.7.5.1","5.7.5.10","5.7.5.11","5.7.5.12","5.7.5.2","5.7.5.3","5.7.5.4","5.7.5.5","5.7.5.6","5.7.5.7","5.7.5.8","5.7.5.9","8.0","8.0.1","8.0.2","8.0.3","8.1.0","8.2.0","8.2.0RC2","8.2.1","8.3.0","8.3.1","8.3.2","8.4.0","8.4.0RC3","8.4.0RC4","8.4.1","8.4.2","8.4.3","8.4.4","8.4.5","8.5.0","8.5.0RC1","8.5.0RC2","8.5.1","8.5.10","8.5.11","8.5.12","8.5.13","8.5.14","8.5.15","8.5.2","8.5.3","8.5.4","8.5.5","8.5.6","8.5.6RC1","8.5.7","8.5.8","8.5.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-3178.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://documentation.concretecms.org/9-x/developers/introduction/version-history/928-release-notes?_gl=1*1bcxp5s*_ga*MTc1NDc0Njk2Mi4xNzA2ODI4MDU1*_ga_HFB3HPNNLS*MTcxMjE2NjYyNi4xMy4xLjE3MTIxNjY2ODEuMC4wLjA."},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://documentation.concretecms.org/developers/introduction/version-history/8516-release-notes?_gl=1*1oa3zn1*_ga*MTc1NDc0Njk2Mi4xNzA2ODI4MDU1*_ga_HFB3HPNNLS*MTcxMjE2NjYyNi4xMy4xLjE3MTIxNjY3MDcuMC4wLjA."}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
