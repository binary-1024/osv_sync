{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-71162","published":"2026-01-25T14:36:09.029Z","modified":"2026-01-30T21:36:22.942867Z","summary":"dmaengine: tegra-adma: Fix use-after-free","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndmaengine: tegra-adma: Fix use-after-free\n\nA use-after-free bug exists in the Tegra ADMA driver when audio streams\nare terminated, particularly during XRUN conditions. The issue occurs\nwhen the DMA buffer is freed by tegra_adma_terminate_all() before the\nvchan completion tasklet finishes accessing it.\n\nThe race condition follows this sequence:\n\n  1. DMA transfer completes, triggering an interrupt that schedules the\n     completion tasklet (tasklet has not executed yet)\n  2. Audio playback stops, calling tegra_adma_terminate_all() which\n     frees the DMA buffer memory via kfree()\n  3. The scheduled tasklet finally executes, calling vchan_complete()\n     which attempts to access the already-freed memory\n\nSince tasklets can execute at any time after being scheduled, there is\nno guarantee that the buffer will remain valid when vchan_complete()\nruns.\n\nFix this by properly synchronizing the virtual channel completion:\n - Calling vchan_terminate_vdesc() in tegra_adma_stop() to mark the\n   descriptors as terminated instead of freeing the descriptor.\n - Add the callback tegra_adma_synchronize() that calls\n   vchan_synchronize() which kills any pending tasklets and frees any\n   terminated descriptors.\n\nCrash logs:\n[  337.427523] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in vchan_complete+0x124/0x3b0\n[  337.427544] Read of size 8 at addr ffff000132055428 by task swapper/0/0\n\n[
