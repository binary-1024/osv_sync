{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"OESA-2024-1046","published":"2024-01-12T11:06:44Z","modified":"2025-09-03T06:19:43.019997Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-52323"],"summary":"python-pycryptodome security update","details":"PyCryptodome is a self-contained Python package of low-level cryptographic primitives. It supports Python 2.6 and 2.7, Python 3.4 and newer, and PyPy. You can install it with::     pip install pycryptodome All modules are installed under the ``Crypto`` package. Check the pycryptodomex_ project for the equivalent library that works under the ``Cryptodome`` package. PyCryptodome is a fork of PyCrypto. It brings several enhancements with respect to the last official version of PyCrypto (2.6.1), for instance: * Authenticated encryption modes (GCM, CCM, EAX, SIV, OCB) * Accelerated AES on Intel platforms via AES-NI * First class support for PyPy * Elliptic curves cryptography (NIST P-256, P-384 and P-521 curves only) * Better and more compact API (`nonce` and `iv` attributes for ciphers,   automatic generation of random nonces and IVs, simplified CTR cipher mode,   and more) * SHA-3 (including SHAKE XOFs) and BLAKE2 hash algorithms * Salsa20 and ChaCha20 stream ciphers * scrypt and HKDF * Deterministic (EC)DSA * Password-protected PKCS#8 key containers * Shamir&apos;s Secret Sharing scheme * Random numbers get sourced directly from the OS (and not from a CSPRNG in userspace) * Simplified install process, including better support for Windows * Cleaner RSA and DSA key generation (largely based on FIPS 186-4) * Major clean ups and simplification of the code base PyCryptodome is not a wrapper to a separate C library like *OpenSSL*. To the largest possible extent, algorithms are implemented in pure Python. Only the pieces that are extremely critical to performance (e.g. block ciphers) are implemented as C extensions.
