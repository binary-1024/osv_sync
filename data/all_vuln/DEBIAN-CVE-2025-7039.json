An integer overflow during temporary file creation leads to an out-of-bounds memory access, allowing an attacker to potentially perform path traversal or access private temporary file content by creating symbolic links. This vulnerability allows a local attacker to manipulate file paths and access unauthorized data. The core issue stems from insufficient validation of file path lengths during temporary file operations.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"glib2.0","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/glib2.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.66.8-1+deb11u7"}]}],"versions":["2.66.8-1","2.66.8-1+deb11u1","2.66.8-1+deb11u2","2.66.8-1+deb11u3","2.66.8-1+deb11u4","2.66.8-1+deb11u5","2.66.8-1+deb11u6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-7039.json"}},{"package":{"name":"glib2.0","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/glib2.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.74.6-2+deb12u7"}]}],"versions":["2.74.6-2","2.74.6-2+deb12u1","2.74.6-2+deb12u2","2.74.6-2+deb12u3","2.74.6-2+deb12u4","2.74.6-2+deb12u5","2.74.6-2+deb12u6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-7039.json"}},{"package":{"name":"glib2.0","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/glib2.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.84.4-3~deb13u1"}]}],"versions":["2.84.3-1","2.84.4-1","2.84.4-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-7039.json"}},{"package":{"name":"glib2.0","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/glib2.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.84.4-1"}]}],"versions":["2.84.3-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-7039.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-7039"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
