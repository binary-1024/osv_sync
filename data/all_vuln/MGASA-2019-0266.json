On systems with memory access protections,\nthis can cause the CGI process to terminate unexpectedly, resulting in a\ndenial of service for all clients using it (CVE-2019-12854).\n\nIt was discovered that Squid incorrectly handled the cachemgr.cgi web\nmodule. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to conduct\ncross-site scripting (XSS) attacks (CVE-2019-13345).\n\nThe squid package has been updated to version 4.8, fixing these issues and\nother bugs.\n",
