The server may recover after the attack ceases. Use of ACLs will not mitigate the attack. \nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.18.1 through 9.18.27, 9.19.0 through 9.19.24, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.27-S1.(CVE-2024-0760)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"bind","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/bind&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.18.21-3.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["bind-9.18.21-3.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","bind-chroot-9.18.21-3.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","bind-debuginfo-9.18.21-3.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","bind-debugsource-9.18.21-3.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","bind-devel-9.18.21-3.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","bind-dnssec-utils-9.18.21-3.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","bind-libs-9.18.21-3.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","bind-utils-9.18.21-3.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["bind-dnssec-doc-9.18.21-3.oe2403.noarch.rpm","bind-license-9.18.21-3.oe2403.noarch.rpm"],"src":["bind-9.18.21-3.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["bind-9.18.21-3.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","bind-chroot-9.18.21-3.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","bind-debuginfo-9.18.21-3.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","bind-debugsource-9.18.21-3.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","bind-devel-9.18.21-3.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","bind-dnssec-utils-9.18.21-3.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","bind-libs-9.18.21-3.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","bind-utils-9.18.21-3.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-2016.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2024-2016"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0760"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
