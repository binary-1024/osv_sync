{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-54157","published":"2025-12-24T13:16:17.750Z","modified":"2025-12-25T11:14:18.114819Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-54157"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  binder: fix UAF of alloc->vma in race with munmap()  [ cmllamas: clean forward port from commit 015ac18be7de (\"binder: fix   UAF of alloc->vma in race with munmap()\") in 5.10 stable. It is needed   in mainline after the revert of commit a43cfc87caaf (\"android: binder:   stop saving a pointer to the VMA\") as pointed out by Liam. The commit   log and tags have been tweaked to reflect this. ]  In commit 720c24192404 (\"ANDROID: binder: change down_write to down_read\") binder assumed the mmap read lock is sufficient to protect alloc->vma inside binder_update_page_range(). This used to be accurate until commit dd2283f2605e (\"mm: mmap: zap pages with read mmap_sem in munmap\"), which now downgrades the mmap_lock after detaching the vma from the rbtree in munmap(). Then it proceeds to teardown and free the vma with only the read lock held.  This means that accesses to alloc->vma in binder_update_page_range() now will race with vm_area_free() in munmap() and can cause a UAF as shown in the following KASAN trace:    ==================================================================   BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in vm_insert_page+0x7c/0x1f0   Read of size 8 at addr ffff16204ad00600 by task server/558    CPU: 3 PID: 558 Comm: server Not tainted 5.10.150-00001-gdc8dcf942daa #1   Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)   Call trace:    dump_backtrace+0x0/0x2a0    show_stack+0x18/0x2c    dump_stack+0xf8/0x164    print_address_description.constprop.0+0x9c/0x538    kasan_report+0x120/0x200    __asan_load8+0xa0/0xc4    vm_insert_page+0x7c/0x1f0    binder_update_page_range+0x278/0x50c    binder_alloc_new_buf+0x3f0/0xba0    binder_transaction+0x64c/0x3040    binder_thread_write+0x924/0x2020    binder_ioctl+0x1610/0x2e5c    __arm64_sys_ioctl+0xd4/0x120    el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0xac/0x270    do_el0_svc+0x38/0xa0    el0_svc+0x1c/0x2c    el0_sync_handler+0xe8/0x114    el0_sync+0x180/0x1c0    Allocated by task 559:    kasan_save_stack+0x38/0x6c    __kasan_kmalloc.constprop.0+0xe4/0xf0    kasan_slab_alloc+0x18/0x2c    kmem_cache_alloc+0x1b0/0x2d0    vm_area_alloc+0x28/0x94    mmap_region+0x378/0x920    do_mmap+0x3f0/0x600    vm_mmap_pgoff+0x150/0x17c    ksys_mmap_pgoff+0x284/0x2dc    __arm64_sys_mmap+0x84/0xa4    el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0xac/0x270    do_el0_svc+0x38/0xa0    el0_svc+0x1c/0x2c    el0_sync_handler+0xe8/0x114    el0_sync+0x180/0x1c0    Freed by task 560:    kasan_save_stack+0x38/0x6c    kasan_set_track+0x28/0x40    kasan_set_free_info+0x24/0x4c    __kasan_slab_free+0x100/0x164    kasan_slab_free+0x14/0x20    kmem_cache_free+0xc4/0x34c    vm_area_free+0x1c/0x2c    remove_vma+0x7c/0x94    __do_munmap+0x358/0x710    __vm_munmap+0xbc/0x130    __arm64_sys_munmap+0x4c/0x64    el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0xac/0x270    do_el0_svc+0x38/0xa0    el0_svc+0x1c/0x2c    el0_sync_handler+0xe8/0x114    el0_sync+0x180/0x1c0    [...]   ==================================================================  To prevent the race above, revert back to taking the mmap write lock inside binder_update_page_range(). One might expect an increase of mmap lock contention. However, binder already serializes these calls via top level alloc->mutex. Also, there was no performance impact shown when running the binder benchmark tests.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.10.103-1","5.10.103-1~bpo10+1","5.10.106-1","5.10.113-1","5.10.120-1","5.10.120-1~bpo10+1","5.10.127-1","5.10.127-2","5.10.127-2~bpo10+1","5.10.136-1","5.10.140-1","5.10.148-1","5.10.149-1","5.10.149-2","5.10.158-1","5.10.158-2","5.10.162-1","5.10.178-1","5.10.178-2","5.10.178-3","5.10.179-1","5.10.179-2","5.10.179-3","5.10.179-4","5.10.179-5","5.10.191-1","5.10.197-1","5.10.205-1","5.10.205-2","5.10.209-1","5.10.209-2","5.10.216-1","5.10.218-1","5.10.221-1","5.10.223-1","5.10.226-1","5.10.234-1","5.10.237-1","5.10.244-1","5.10.247-1","5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1","5.10.92-2","5.13.12-1~exp1","5.13.9-1~exp1","5.13.9-1~exp2","5.14-1~exp1","5.14-1~exp2","5.14.1-1~exp1","5.14.12-1","5.14.16-1","5.14.2-1~exp1","5.14.3-1~exp1","5.14.6-1","5.14.6-2","5.14.6-3","5.14.9-1","5.14.9-2","5.14.9-2~bpo11+1","5.15-1~exp1","5.15.1-1~exp1","5.15.15-1","5.15.15-2","5.15.15-2~bpo11+1","5.15.2-1~exp1","5.15.3-1","5.15.5-1","5.15.5-2","5.15.5-2~bpo11+1","5.16.10-1","5.16.11-1","5.16.11-1~bpo11+1","5.16.12-1","5.16.12-1~bpo11+1","5.16.14-1","5.16.18-1","5.16.3-1~exp1","5.16.4-1~exp1","5.16.7-1","5.16.7-2","5.16~rc1-1~exp1","5.16~rc3-1~exp1","5.16~rc4-1~exp1","5.16~rc5-1~exp1","5.16~rc6-1~exp1","5.16~rc7-1~exp1","5.16~rc8-1~exp1","5.17.1-1~exp1","5.17.11-1","5.17.3-1","5.17.6-1","5.17~rc3-1~exp1","5.17~rc4-1~exp1","5.17~rc5-1~exp1","5.17~rc6-1~exp1","5.17~rc7-1~exp1","5.17~rc8-1~exp1","5.18-1~exp1","5.18.14-1","5.18.14-1~bpo11+1","5.18.16-1","5.18.16-1~bpo11+1","5.18.2-1","5.18.2-1~bpo11+1","5.18.5-1","5.19-1~exp1","5.19.11-1","5.19.11-1~bpo11+1","5.19.6-1","5.19~rc4-1~exp1","5.19~rc6-1~exp1","6.0-1~exp1","6.0.10-1","6.0.10-2","6.0.12-1","6.0.12-1+alpha","6.0.12-1~bpo11+1","6.0.2-1","6.0.3-1","6.0.3-1~bpo11+1","6.0.5-1","6.0.6-1","6.0.6-2","6.0.7-1","6.0.8-1","6.0~rc7-1~exp1","6.1.1-1~exp1","6.1.1-1~exp2","6.1.106-1","6.1.106-2","6.1.106-3","6.1.11-1","6.1.112-1","6.1.115-1","6.1.119-1","6.1.12-1","6.1.12-1~bpo11+1","6.1.123-1","6.1.124-1","6.1.128-1","6.1.129-1","6.1.133-1","6.1.135-1","6.1.137-1","6.1.139-1","6.1.140-1","6.1.147-1","6.1.148-1","6.1.15-1","6.1.15-1~bpo11+1","6.1.153-1","6.1.158-1","6.1.2-1~exp1","6.1.20-1","6.1.20-1~bpo11+1","6.1.20-2","6.1.20-2~bpo11+1","6.1.25-1","6.1.27-1","6.1.27-1~bpo11+1","6.1.37-1","6.1.38-1","6.1.38-2","6.1.38-2~bpo11+1","6.1.38-3","6.1.38-4","6.1.38-4~bpo11+1","6.1.4-1","6.1.52-1","6.1.55-1","6.1.55-1~bpo11+1","6.1.64-1","6.1.66-1","6.1.67-1","6.1.69-1","6.1.69-1~bpo11+1","6.1.7-1","6.1.76-1","6.1.76-1~bpo11+1","6.1.8-1","6.1.8-1+sh4","6.1.82-1","6.1.85-1","6.1.90-1","6.1.90-1~bpo11+1","6.1.94-1","6.1.94-1~bpo11+1","6.1.98-1","6.1.99-1","6.10-1~exp1","6.10.1-1~exp1","6.10.11-1","6.10.11-1~bpo12+1","6.10.12-1","6.10.3-1","6.10.4-1","6.10.6-1","6.10.6-1~bpo12+1","6.10.7-1","6.10.9-1","6.11-1~exp1","6.11.10-1","6.11.10-1~bpo12+1","6.11.2-1","6.11.4-1","6.11.5-1","6.11.5-1~bpo12+1","6.11.6-1","6.11.7-1","6.11.9-1","6.11~rc4-1~exp1","6.11~rc5-1~exp1","6.12.10-1","6.12.11-1","6.12.11-1+alpha","6.12.11-1+alpha.1","6.12.12-1","6.12.12-1~bpo12+1","6.12.13-1","6.12.15-1","6.12.16-1","6.12.17-1","6.12.19-1","6.12.20-1","6.12.21-1","6.12.22-1","6.12.22-1~bpo12+1","6.12.25-1","6.12.27-1","6.12.27-1~bpo12+1","6.12.29-1","6.12.3-1","6.12.30-1","6.12.30-1~bpo12+1","6.12.31-1","6.12.32-1","6.12.32-1~bpo12+1","6.12.33-1","6.12.33-1~bpo12+1","6.12.35-1","6.12.35-1~bpo12+1","6.12.37-1","6.12.38-1","6.12.38-1~bpo12+1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.5-1","6.12.57-1","6.12.57-1~bpo12+1","6.12.6-1","6.12.8-1","6.12.9-1","6.12.9-1+alpha","6.12.9-1~bpo12+1","6.12~rc6-1~exp1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.10-1","6.16.11-1","6.16.12-1","6.16.12-1~bpo13+1","6.16.12-2","6.16.3-1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16.5-1","6.16.6-1","6.16.7-1","6.16.8-1","6.16.9-1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1","6.17.10-1","6.17.11-1","6.17.12-1","6.17.13-1","6.17.2-1~exp1","6.17.5-1~exp1","6.17.6-1","6.17.7-1","6.17.7-2","6.17.8-1","6.17.8-1~bpo13+1","6.17.9-1","6.18.1-1~exp1","6.18.2-1~exp1","6.18~rc4-1~exp1","6.18~rc4-1~exp2","6.18~rc5-1~exp1","6.18~rc6-1~exp1","6.18~rc7-1~exp1","6.1~rc3-1~exp1","6.1~rc5-1~exp1","6.1~rc6-1~exp1","6.1~rc7-1~exp1","6.1~rc8-1~exp1","6.3.1-1~exp1","6.3.11-1","6.3.2-1~exp1","6.3.4-1~exp1","6.3.5-1~exp1","6.3.7-1","6.3.7-1~bpo12+1","6.4.1-1~exp1","6.4.11-1","6.4.13-1","6.4.4-1","6.4.4-1~bpo12+1","6.4.4-2","6.4.4-3","6.4.4-3~bpo12+1","6.4~rc6-1~exp1","6.4~rc7-1~exp1",
