A malicious HTTP client can further exploit this to cause a server to automatically read a large amount of data (up to about 1GiB) when a handler fails to read the entire body of a request. Chunk extensions are a little-used HTTP feature which permit including additional metadata in a request or response body sent using the chunked encoding. The net/http chunked encoding reader discards this metadata. A sender can exploit this by inserting a large metadata segment with each byte transferred. The chunk reader now produces an error if the ratio of real body to encoded bytes grows too small.(CVE-2023-39326)\n\nAn attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames. Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request&apos;s headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.(CVE-2023-45288)\n\nThe net/http HTTP/1.1 client mishandled the case where a server responds to a request with an &quot;Expect: 100-continue&quot; header with a non-informational (200 or higher) status. This mishandling could leave a client connection in an invalid state, where the next request sent on the connection will fail. An attacker sending a request to a net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy proxy can exploit this mishandling to cause a denial of service by sending &quot;Expect: 100-continue&quot; requests which elicit a non-informational response from the backend. Each such request leaves the proxy with an invalid connection, and causes one subsequent request using that connection to fail.(CVE-2024-24791)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"etcd","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/etcd&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.4.14-16.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["etcd-3.4.14-16.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["etcd-3.4.14-16.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["etcd-3.4.14-16.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1451.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-1451"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39326"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45288"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24791"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
