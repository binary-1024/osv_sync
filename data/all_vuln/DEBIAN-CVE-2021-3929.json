{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2021-3929","published":"2022-08-25T20:15:09Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:15:18.636773Z","upstream":["CVE-2021-3929"],"details":"A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the NVM Express Controller (NVME) emulation in QEMU. This CVE is similar to CVE-2021-3750 and, just like it, when the reentrancy write triggers the reset function nvme_ctrl_reset(), data structs will be freed leading to a use-after-free issue. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition or, potentially, executing arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process on the host.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"qemu","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/qemu?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:10.0.0+ds-1","1:10.0.0+ds-2","1:10.0.0+ds-2~bpo12+1","1:10.0.0+ds-2~bpo12+2","1:10.0.0~rc0+ds-1","1:10.0.0~rc0+ds-2","1:10.0.0~rc1+ds-1","1:10.0.0~rc1+ds-2","1:10.0.0~rc2+ds-1","1:10.0.0~rc2+ds-2","1:10.0.0~rc3+ds-1","1:10.0.0~rc3+ds-2","1:10.0.2+ds-1","1:10.0.2+ds-2","1:10.0.2+ds-2~bpo12+1","1:10.0.3+ds-1","1:10.0.3+ds-2","1:10.0.3+ds-3","1:10.0.3+ds-4","1:10.1.0+ds-1","1:10.1.0+ds-2","1:10.1.0+ds-3","1:10.1.0+ds-4","1:10.1.0+ds-5","1:10.1.0~rc0+ds-1","1:10.1.0~rc0+ds-2","1:10.1.0~rc0+ds-3","1:10.1.0~rc0+ds-4","1:10.1.0~rc1+ds-1","1:10.1.0~rc1+ds-1a","1:10.1.0~rc1+ds-1b","1:10.1.0~rc1+ds-2","1:10.1.0~rc1+ds-3","1:10.1.0~rc2+ds-1","1:10.1.0~rc3+ds-1","1:10.1.0~rc3+ds-2","1:5.2+dfsg-11","1:5.2+dfsg-11+deb11u1","1:5.2+dfsg-11+deb11u2","1:5.2+dfsg-11+deb11u3","1:5.2+dfsg-11+deb11u4","1:5.2+dfsg-11+deb11u5","1:6.0+dfsg-1~exp0","1:6.0+dfsg-2exp","1:6.0+dfsg-3","1:6.0+dfsg-4","1:6.1+dfsg-1","1:6.1+dfsg-2","1:6.1+dfsg-3","1:6.1+dfsg-4","1:6.1+dfsg-5","1:6.1+dfsg-6","1:6.1+dfsg-6~bpo11+1","1:6.1+dfsg-7","1:6.1+dfsg-8","1:6.2+dfsg-1","1:6.2+dfsg-2","1:6.2+dfsg-2~bpo11+1","1:6.2+dfsg-3","1:7.0+dfsg-1","1:7.0+dfsg-2","1:7.0+dfsg-2~bpo11+1","1:7.0+dfsg-2~bpo11+2","1:7.0+dfsg-3","1:7.0+dfsg-4","1:7.0+dfsg-5","1:7.0+dfsg-6","1:7.0+dfsg-7","1:7.0~rc4+dfsg-1","1:7.1+dfsg-1","1:7.1+dfsg-2","1:7.1+dfsg-2~bpo11+1","1:7.1+dfsg-2~bpo11+2","1:7.1+dfsg-2~bpo11+3","1:7.2+dfsg-1","1:7.2+dfsg-1~bpo11+1","1:7.2+dfsg-1~bpo11+2","1:7.2+dfsg-2","1:7.2+dfsg-2~bpo11+1","1:7.2+dfsg-3","1:7.2+dfsg-3~bpo11+1","1:7.2+dfsg-4","1:7.2+dfsg-5","1:7.2+dfsg-5~bpo11+1","1:7.2+dfsg-6","1:7.2+dfsg-7","1:7.2+dfsg-7~bpo11+1","1:8.0+dfsg-1","1:8.0+dfsg-2","1:8.0+dfsg-3","1:8.0+dfsg-4","1:8.0.2+dfsg-1","1:8.0.2+dfsg-2","1:8.0.2+dfsg-3","1:8.0.3+dfsg-1","1:8.0.3+dfsg-1~bpo12+1","1:8.0.3+dfsg-2","1:8.0.3+dfsg-3","1:8.0.3+dfsg-4","1:8.0.3+dfsg-5","1:8.0.4+dfsg-1","1:8.0.4+dfsg-1~bpo12+1","1:8.0.4+dfsg-2","1:8.0.4+dfsg-3","1:8.0~rc2+dfsg-1","1:8.0~rc3+dfsg-1","1:8.0~rc3+dfsg-2","1:8.0~rc4+dfsg-1","1:8.0~rc4+dfsg-2","1:8.1.0+ds-1","1:8.1.0+ds-1~exp1","1:8.1.0+ds-1~exp2","1:8.1.0+ds-2","1:8.1.0+ds-3","1:8.1.0+ds-4","1:8.1.0+ds-5","1:8.1.0+ds-6","1:8.1.0~rc2+dfsg-1","1:8.1.0~rc3+dfsg-1","1:8.1.0~rc3+dfsg-2","1:8.1.0~rc4+ds-1","1:8.1.0~rc4+ds-2","1:8.1.0~rc4+ds-3","1:8.1.0~rc4+ds-4","1:8.1.1+ds-1","1:8.1.1+ds-2","1:8.1.1+ds-2~bpo12+1","1:8.1.2+ds-1","1:8.1.2+ds-1~bpo12+1","1:8.1.3+ds-1","1:8.2.0+ds-1","1:8.2.0+ds-2","1:8.2.0+ds-3","1:8.2.0+ds-4","1:8.2.0+ds-5","1:8.2.0+ds-5~bpo12+1","1:8.2.0~rc0+ds-1","1:8.2.0~rc1+ds-1","1:8.2.0~rc2+ds-1","1:8.2.1+ds-1","1:8.2.1+ds-1~bpo12+1","1:8.2.1+ds-2","1:8.2.2+ds-1","1:8.2.2+ds-2","1:8.2.3+ds-1","1:8.2.3+ds-2","1:8.2.4+ds-1","1:8.2.4+ds-2","1:8.2.5+ds-1","1:8.2.5+ds-2","1:9.0.0~rc0+ds-1","1:9.0.0~rc0+ds-2","1:9.0.0~rc2+ds-1","1:9.0.1+ds-1","1:9.0.1+ds-1~bpo12+1","1:9.0.2+ds-1","1:9.0.2+ds-1~bpo12+1","1:9.0.2+ds-2","1:9.0.2+ds-3","1:9.0.2+ds-4","1:9.0.2+ds-5","1:9.0.2+ds-6","1:9.0.2+ds-7","1:9.1.0+ds-1","1:9.1.0+ds-2","1:9.1.0+ds-3","1:9.1.0+ds-4","1:9.1.0+ds-5","1:9.1.0+ds-6","1:9.1.0+ds-7","1:9.1.0+ds-8","1:9.1.0+ds-9~exp0","1:9.1.0~rc0+ds-1","1:9.1.0~rc0+ds-2","1:9.1.0~rc0+ds-3","1:9.1.1+ds-1","1:9.1.1+ds-2","1:9.1.1+ds-2~bpo12+1","1:9.1.1+ds-3","1:9.1.1+ds-4","1:9.1.1+ds-5","1:9.1.2+ds-1","1:9.1.2+ds-1~bpo12+1","1:9.2.0+ds-1","1:9.2.0+ds-1~exp1","1:9.2.0+ds-2","1:9.2.0+ds-3","1:9.2.0+ds-3~bpo12+1","1:9.2.0+ds-3~bpo12+2","1:9.2.0+ds-4","1:9.2.0+ds-5","1:9.2.0~rc0+ds-1","1:9.2.0~rc3+ds-1","1:9.2.1+ds-1","1:9.2.2+ds-1","1:9.2.2+ds-1~bpo12+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not
