Anders and Philippe have reported that recent kernels occasionally hang when used with NFS in readahead code.  The problem has been bisected to 7c877586da3 (\"readahead: properly shorten readahead when falling back to do_page_cache_ra()\").  The cause of the problem is that ra->size can be shrunk by read_pages() call and subsequently we end up calling do_page_cache_ra() with negative (read huge positive) number of pages.  Let's revert 7c877586da3 for now until we can find a proper way how the logic in read_pages() and page_cache_ra_order() can coexist.  This can lead to reduced readahead throughput due to readahead window confusion but that's better than outright hangs.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-57839.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-57839.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-57839"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
