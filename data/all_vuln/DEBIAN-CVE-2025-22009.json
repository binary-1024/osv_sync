  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  regulator: dummy: force synchronous probing  Sometimes I get a NULL pointer dereference at boot time in kobject_get() with the following call stack:  anatop_regulator_probe()  devm_regulator_register()   regulator_register()    regulator_resolve_supply()     kobject_get()  By placing some extra BUG_ON() statements I could verify that this is raised because probing of the 'dummy' regulator driver is not completed ('dummy_regulator_rdev' is still NULL).  In the JTAG debugger I can see that dummy_regulator_probe() and anatop_regulator_probe() can be run by different kernel threads (kworker/u4:*).  I haven't further investigated whether this can be changed or if there are other possibilities to force synchronization between these two probe routines.  On the other hand I don't expect much boot time penalty by probing the 'dummy' regulator synchronously.",
