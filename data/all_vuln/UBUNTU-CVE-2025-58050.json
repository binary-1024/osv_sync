In version 10.45, a heap-buffer-overflow read vulnerability exists in the PCRE2 regular expression matching engine, specifically within the handling of the (*scs:...) (Scan SubString) verb when combined with (*ACCEPT) in src/pcre2_match.c. This vulnerability may potentially lead to information disclosure if the out-of-bounds data read during the memcmp affects the final match result in a way observable by the attacker. This issue has been resolved in version 10.46.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"pcre2","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.04","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/pcre2@10.45-1ubuntu0.1?arch=source&distro=plucky"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"10.45-1ubuntu0.1"}]}],"versions":["10.42-4ubuntu3","10.45-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"libpcre2-16-0","binary_version":"10.45-1ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"libpcre2-32-0","binary_version":"10.45-1ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"libpcre2-8-0","binary_version":"10.45-1ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"libpcre2-dev","binary_version":"10.45-1ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"libpcre2-posix3","binary_version":"10.45-1ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"pcre2-utils","binary_version":"10.45-1ubuntu0.1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-58050.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-58050"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58050"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2/releases/tag/pcre2-10.46"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2/security/advisories/GHSA-c2gv-xgf5-5cc2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7777-1"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:L/SC:L/SI:N/SA:L"},{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
