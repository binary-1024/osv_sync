Versions before 0.1.2 do not perform any active action.\n\nThe original umap package existed in the past, but was removed by the author. The last version was 0.1.1 published as a source package. Years later, the same name was registered by another user, who managed to publish a wheel package of version 0.1.1 as it's not prohibited to upload alternative build packages for existing versions. This hijacked version was an empty package. In 0.1.2, a beacon webhook was added. \n\nMore context: https://github.com/kam193/package-campaigns/issues/5\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: GENERIC-standard-pypi-install-pentest\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"umap","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/umap"},"versions":["0.0.0","0.1.1","0.1.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/umap/MAL-2025-192992.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/umap"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"id":"pypi/GENERIC-standard-pypi-install-pentest/umap","import_time":"2025-12-31T12:48:17.936750127Z","modified_time":"2025-12-31T11:45:36.692132Z","sha256":"f9193e80107a3f7a1b0bb8b91f7414a47469e00dd7ce18638c519ab0130ae6f0","source":"kam193","versions":["0.0.0","0.1.1","0.1.2"]},{"id":"pypi/GENERIC-standard-pypi-install-pentest/umap","import_time":"2026-01-15T17:45:22.349753131Z","modified_time":"2025-12-31T11:45:36.692132Z","sha256":"9b53a7043e21a18b15d67f5ecd8419b2243dfbaf90b4015bdda60671bfdd2f09","source":"kam193","versions":["0.0.0","0.1.1","0.1.2"]},{"id":"pypi/GENERIC-standard-pypi-install-pentest/umap","import_time":"2026-01-15T22:07:43.796062406Z","modified_time":"2025-12-31T11:45:36.692132Z","sha256":"f6dd42f96f818641d94fd4a2085dfd1071b6ce3fa44a3f05b785245ab4d1c886","source":"kam193","versions":["0.0.0","0.1.1","0.1.2"]}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"],"type":"ANALYST"}]}
