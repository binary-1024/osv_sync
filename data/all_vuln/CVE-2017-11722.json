{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2017-11722","published":"2017-07-28T13:29:00Z","modified":"2025-08-09T19:01:28Z","details":"The WriteOnePNGImage function in coders/png.c in GraphicsMagick 1.3.26 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted file, because the program's actual control flow was inconsistent with its indentation. This resulted in a logging statement executing outside of a loop, and consequently using an invalid array index corresponding to the loop's exit condition.","references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"http://hg.code.sf.net/p/graphicsmagick/code/rev/f423ba88ca4e"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4321"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PF62B5PJA2JDUOCKJGUQO3SPL74BEYSV/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WHIKB4TP6KBJWT2UIPWL5MWMG5QXKGEJ/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
