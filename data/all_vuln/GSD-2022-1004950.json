  "summary": "Redirection of DNS domain in eth.link domain name version 2022-07-31 and later",
  "details": "The eth.link domain name was taken over by a new, unknown, entity on  2022-07-31 (\"eth.link has expired. Was this your domain name and would like to renew it? Click here to login to your Uniregistry.com account\r\neth.link\"). The domain currently shows a parked \"for sale\" page, but an attacker that buys it (or the current owner) could easily serve DNS queries for the domain and subdomains (of which there were many). All client software and existing links pointing at eth.link or subdomains can be attacked via spoofing and impersonation of web sites with valid certificates/etc resulting in easy social engineering.",
