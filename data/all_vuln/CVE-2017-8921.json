{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2017-8921","published":"2017-05-12T19:29:00Z","modified":"2025-09-20T17:02:02Z","details":"In FlightGear before 2017.2.1, the FGCommand interface allows overwriting any file the user has write access to, but not with arbitrary data: only with the contents of a FlightGear flightplan (XML). A resource such as a malicious third-party aircraft could exploit this to damage files belonging to the user. Both this issue and CVE-2016-9956 are directory traversal vulnerabilities in Autopilot/route_mgr.cxx - this one exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-9956.","references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://sourceforge.net/p/flightgear/flightgear/ci/faf872e7f71ca14c567ac7080561fc785d8d2fd0/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
