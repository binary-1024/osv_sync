This impacts scanning DKIM keys (both `--dkim` and `--dkim-dns`), SSH keys (`--ssh-lines` mode), and filenames in various modes.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been fixed with the following commits:\nhttps://github.com/badkeys/badkeys/commit/de631f69f040974bb5fb442cdab9a1d904c64087\nhttps://github.com/badkeys/badkeys/commit/635a2f3b1b50a895d8b09ec8629efc06189f349a\n\nAll users should upgrade `badkeys` to version 0.0.16.\n\n### Resources\n\nhttps://github.com/badkeys/badkeys/issues/40","affected":[{"package":{"name":"badkeys","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/badkeys"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.0.16"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.0.10","0.0.11","0.0.12","0.0.13","0.0.14","0.0.15","0.0.2","0.0.3","0.0.4","0.0.5","0.0.6","0.0.7","0.0.8","0.0.9"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 0.0.15","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-wjpc-4f29-83h3/GHSA-wjpc-4f29-83h3.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/badkeys/badkeys/security/advisories/GHSA-wjpc-4f29-83h3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/badkeys/badkeys/issues/40"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/badkeys/badkeys/commit/635a2f3b1b50a895d8b09ec8629efc06189f349a"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/badkeys/badkeys/commit/de631f69f040974bb5fb442cdab9a1d904c64087"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/badkeys/badkeys"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-150"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-05T19:42:12Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
