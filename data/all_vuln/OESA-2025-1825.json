  "details": "Requests is an HTTP library, written in Python, as an alternative to Python&amp;apos;s builtin urllib2 which requires work (even method overrides) to perform basic tasks. Features of Requests:  - GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE Requests:    + HTTP Header Request Attachment.    + Data/Params Request Attachment.    + Multipart File Uploads.    + CookieJar Support.    + Redirection History.    + Redirection Recursion Urllib Fix.    + Automatic Decompression of GZipped Content.    + Unicode URL Support.  - Authentication:    + URL + HTTP Auth Registry.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nRequests is a HTTP library. Due to a URL parsing issue, Requests releases prior to 2.32.4 may leak .netrc credentials to third parties for specific maliciously-crafted URLs. Users should upgrade to version 2.32.4 to receive a fix. For older versions of Requests, use of the .netrc file can be disabled with `trust_env=False` on one&apos;s Requests Session.(CVE-2024-47081)",
