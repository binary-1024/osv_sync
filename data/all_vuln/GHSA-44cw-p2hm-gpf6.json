  "details": "Opencast before version 8.9 and 7.9 disables HTTPS hostname verification of its HTTP client used for a large portion of Opencast's HTTP requests.\n\nHostname verification is an important part when using HTTPS to ensure that the presented certificate is valid for the host. Disabling it can allow for man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem is fixed in Opencast 7.9 and Opencast 8.9\n\n### Self-Signed Certificates\n\nPlease be aware that fixing the problem means that Opencast will not simply accept any self-signed certificates any longer without properly importing them. If you need those, please make sure to import them into the Java key store. Better yet, get a valid certificate e.g. from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org).",
