Prior to 2.7.0, there is a critical sandbox escape vulnerability in enclave-vm that allows untrusted, sandboxed JavaScript code to execute arbitrary code in the host Node.js runtime. When a tool invocation fails, enclave-vm exposes a host-side Error object to sandboxed code. This Error object retains its host realm prototype chain, which can be traversed to reach the host Function constructor. An attacker can intentionally trigger a host error, then climb the prototype chain. Using the host Function constructor, arbitrary JavaScript can be compiled and executed in the host context, fully bypassing the sandbox and granting access to sensitive resources such as process.env, filesystem, and network. This breaks enclave-vm’s core security guarantee of isolating untrusted code. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.7.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/agentfront/enclave","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"09f9b53177977469d33f08fe757c802565e2b708"}]}],"versions":["ast-guard@1.1.0","ast-guard@1.1.1","ast-guard@1.1.2","ast-guard@2.0.0","ast-guard@2.1.0","ast-guard@2.2.0","ast-guard@2.3.0","enclave-vm@1.0.2","enclave-vm@1.0.3","enclave-vm@2.0.0","enclave-vm@2.1.0","enclave-vm@2.2.0","enclave-vm@2.3.0","enclave-vm@2.4.0","enclave-vm@2.5.0","enclave-vm@2.6.0","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v2.0.0","vectoriadb@2.0.0","vectoriadb@2.0.1","vectoriadb@2.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22686.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22686.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/agentfront/enclave/commit/ed8bc438b2cd6e6f0b5f2de321e5be6f0169b5a1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/agentfront/enclave/security/advisories/GHSA-7qm7-455j-5p63"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22686"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-693","CWE-94"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22686.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
