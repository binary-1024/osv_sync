  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix oob access in cgroup local storage\n\nLonial reported that an out-of-bounds access in cgroup local storage\ncan be crafted via tail calls. Given two programs each utilizing a\ncgroup local storage with a different value size, and one program\ndoing a tail call into the other. The verifier will validate each of\nthe indivial programs just fine. However, in the runtime context\nthe bpf_cg_run_ctx holds an bpf_prog_array_item which contains the\nBPF program as well as any cgroup local storage flavor the program\nuses. Helpers such as bpf_get_local_storage() pick this up from the\nruntime context:\n\n  ctx = container_of(current->bpf_ctx, struct bpf_cg_run_ctx, run_ctx);\n  storage = ctx->prog_item->cgroup_storage[stype];\n\n  if (stype == BPF_CGROUP_STORAGE_SHARED)\n    ptr = &READ_ONCE(storage->buf)->data[0];\n  else\n    ptr = this_cpu_ptr(storage->percpu_buf);\n\nFor the second program which was called from the originally attached\none, this means bpf_get_local_storage() will pick up the former\nprogram's map, not its own. With mismatching sizes, this can result\nin an unintended out-of-bounds access.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to extend bpf_map_owner with an array of\nstorage_cookie[] to match on i) the exact maps from the original\nprogram if the second program was using bpf_get_local_storage(), or\nii) allow the tail call combination if the second program was not\nusing any of the cgroup local storage maps.",
