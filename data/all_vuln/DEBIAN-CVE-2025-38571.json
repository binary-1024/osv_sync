  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sunrpc: fix client side handling of tls alerts  A security exploit was discovered in NFS over TLS in tls_alert_recv due to its assumption that there is valid data in the msghdr's iterator's kvec.  Instead, this patch proposes the rework how control messages are setup and used by sock_recvmsg().  If no control message structure is setup, kTLS layer will read and process TLS data record types. As soon as it encounters a TLS control message, it would return an error. At that point, NFS can setup a kvec backed control buffer and read in the control message such as a TLS alert. Scott found that a msg iterator can advance the kvec pointer as a part of the copy process thus we need to revert the iterator before calling into the tls_alert_recv.",
