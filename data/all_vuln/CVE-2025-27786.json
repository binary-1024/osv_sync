{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-27786","published":"2025-03-19T20:37:35Z","modified":"2025-11-12T02:42:45.320609Z","summary":"Applio allows arbitrary file removal in core.py","details":"Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.8-bugfix and prior are vulnerable to arbitrary file removal in core.py. `output_tts_path` in tts.py takes arbitrary user input and passes it to `run_tts_script` function in core.py, which checks if the path in `output_tts_path` exists, and if yes, removes that path, which leads to arbitrary file removal. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/iahispano/applio","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"0c92ac552f97ee8b5697eef35350693ab3b1ecce"}]}],"versions":["3.0.0","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.0.5","3.0.6","3.0.7","3.0.8","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.2.3","3.2.4","3.2.5","3.2.6","3.2.7","3.2.8-bugfix"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-27786.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/blob/29b4a00e4be209f9aac51cd9ccffcc632dfb2973/core.py#L329"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/blob/29b4a00e4be209f9aac51cd9ccffcc632dfb2973/tabs/tts/tts.py#L133"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-341_GHSL-2024-353_Applio/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
