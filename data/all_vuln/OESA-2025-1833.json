  "details": "The GIMP is an image composition and editing program, which can be used for creating logos and other graphics for Web pages. The GIMP offers many tools and filters, and provides a large image manipulation toolbox, including channel operations and layers, effects, subpixel imaging and antialiasing, and conversions, together with multilevel undo. The GIMP offers a scripting facility, but many of the included scripts rely on fonts that we cannot distribute.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability was found in GIMP (Image Processing Software) (affected version not known) and classified as critical.Using CWE to declare the problem leads to CWE-190. The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.Impacted is confidentiality, integrity, and availability.There is no information about possible countermeasures known. It may be suggested to replace the affected object with an alternative product.(CVE-2025-6035)",
