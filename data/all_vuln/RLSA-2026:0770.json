With gpsd, multiple GPS client applications (such as navigational and war-driving software) can share access to a GPS without contention or loss of data.  Also, gpsd responds to queries with a format that is substantially easier to parse than NMEA 0183.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* gpsd: gpsd: Denial of Service due to malformed NAVCOM packet parsing (CVE-2025-67269)\n\n* gpsd: gpsd: Arbitrary code execution via heap-based out-of-bounds write in NMEA2000 packet handling (CVE-2025-67268)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gpsd","ecosystem":"Rocky Linux:10","purl":"pkg:rpm/rocky-linux/gpsd?distro=rocky-linux-10&epoch=1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:3.26.1-1.el10_1.1"}],"database_specific":{"yum_repository":"AppStream"}}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/resf-osv-data/RLSA-2026:0770.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2026:0770"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2426835"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2426810"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}],"credits":[{"name":"Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation"},{"name":"Red Hat"}]}
