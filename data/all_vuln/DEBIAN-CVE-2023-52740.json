  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/64s/interrupt: Fix interrupt exit race with security mitigation switch  The RFI and STF security mitigation options can flip the interrupt_exit_not_reentrant static branch condition concurrently with the interrupt exit code which tests that branch.  Interrupt exit tests this condition to set MSR[EE|RI] for exit, then again in the case a soft-masked interrupt is found pending, to recover the MSR so the interrupt can be replayed before attempting to exit again. If the condition changes between these two tests, the MSR and irq soft-mask state will become corrupted, leading to warnings and possible crashes. For example, if the branch is initially true then false, MSR[EE] will be 0 but PACA_IRQ_HARD_DIS clear and EE may not get enabled, leading to warnings in irq_64.c.",
