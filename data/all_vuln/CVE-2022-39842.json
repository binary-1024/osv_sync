In pxa3xx_gcu_write in drivers/video/fbdev/pxa3xx-gcu.c, the count parameter has a type conflict of size_t versus int, causing an integer overflow and bypassing the size check. After that, because it is used as the third argument to copy_from_user(), a heap overflow may occur. NOTE: the original discoverer disputes that the overflow can actually happen.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/ChangeLog-5.19"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/a09d2d00af53b43c6f11e6ab3cb58443c2cac8a7"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/10/msg00000.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00001.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5257"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lore.kernel.org/all/YylaC1wHHyLw22D3%40kadam/T/"}],"database_specific":{"isDisputed":true},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H"}]}
