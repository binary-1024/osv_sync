{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-38224","published":"2025-07-04T14:15:31Z","modified":"2025-09-25T04:40:19.395296Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-38224"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: kvaser_pciefd: refine error prone echo_skb_max handling logic  echo_skb_max should define the supported upper limit of echo_skb[] allocated inside the netdevice's priv. The corresponding size value provided by this driver to alloc_candev() is KVASER_PCIEFD_CAN_TX_MAX_COUNT which is 17.  But later echo_skb_max is rounded up to the nearest power of two (for the max case, that would be 32) and the tx/ack indices calculated further during tx/rx may exceed the upper array boundary. Kasan reported this for the ack case inside kvaser_pciefd_handle_ack_packet(), though the xmit function has actually caught the same thing earlier.   BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in kvaser_pciefd_handle_ack_packet+0x2d7/0x92a drivers/net/can/kvaser_pciefd.c:1528  Read of size 8 at addr ffff888105e4f078 by task swapper/4/0   CPU: 4 UID: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/4 Not tainted 6.15.0 #12 PREEMPT(voluntary)  Call Trace:   <IRQ>  dump_stack_lvl lib/dump_stack.c:122  print_report mm/kasan/report.c:521  kasan_report mm/kasan/report.c:634  kvaser_pciefd_handle_ack_packet drivers/net/can/kvaser_pciefd.c:1528  kvaser_pciefd_read_packet drivers/net/can/kvaser_pciefd.c:1605  kvaser_pciefd_read_buffer drivers/net/can/kvaser_pciefd.c:1656  kvaser_pciefd_receive_irq drivers/net/can/kvaser_pciefd.c:1684  kvaser_pciefd_irq_handler drivers/net/can/kvaser_pciefd.c:1733  __handle_irq_event_percpu kernel/irq/handle.c:158  handle_irq_event kernel/irq/handle.c:210  handle_edge_irq kernel/irq/chip.c:833  __common_interrupt arch/x86/kernel/irq.c:296  common_interrupt arch/x86/kernel/irq.c:286   </IRQ>  Tx max count definitely matters for kvaser_pciefd_tx_avail(), but for seq numbers' generation that's not the case - we're free to calculate them as would be more convenient, not taking tx max count into account. The only downside is that the size of echo_skb[] should correspond to the max seq number (not tx max count), so in some situations a bit more memory would be consumed than could be.  Thus make the size of the underlying echo_skb[] sufficient for the rounded max tx value.
