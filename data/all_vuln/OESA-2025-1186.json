  "details": "Grafana is an open source, feature rich metrics dashboard and graph editor for Graphite, InfluxDB &amp;amp; OpenTSDB.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nGrafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Versions on the 8.x and 9.x branch prior to 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting via the Unified Alerting feature of Grafana. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to escalate privilege from editor to admin by tricking an authenticated admin to click on a link. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a patch. As a workaround, it is possible to disable alerting or use legacy alerting.(CVE-2022-31097)\n\nGrafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform. Versions prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 are vulnerable to a bypass in the plugin signature verification. An attacker can convince a server admin to download and successfully run a malicious plugin even though unsigned plugins are not allowed. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not install plugins downloaded from untrusted sources.(CVE-2022-31123)\n\nGrafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform. Versions of Grafana for endpoints prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 could leak authentication tokens to some destination plugins under some conditions. The vulnerability impacts data source and plugin proxy endpoints with authentication tokens. The destination plugin could receive a user&apos;s Grafana authentication token. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not use API keys, JWT authentication, or any HTTP Header based authentication.(CVE-2022-31130)\n\nGrafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Versions prior to 9.1.6 and 8.5.13 are vulnerable to an escalation from admin to server admin when auth proxy is used, allowing an admin to take over the server admin account and gain full control of the grafana instance. All installations should be upgraded as soon as possible. As a workaround deactivate auth proxy following the instructions at: https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-authentication/auth-proxy/(CVE-2022-35957)\n\nGrafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In versions prior to 8.5.13, 9.0.9, and 9.1.6, Grafana is subject to Improper Preservation of Permissions resulting in privilege escalation on some folders where Admin is the only used permission. The vulnerability impacts Grafana instances where RBAC was disabled and enabled afterwards, as the migrations which are translating legacy folder permissions to RBAC permissions do not account for the scenario where the only user permission in the folder is Admin, as a result RBAC adds permissions for Editors and Viewers which allow them to edit and view folders accordingly. This issue has been patched in versions 8.5.13, 9.0.9, and 9.1.6. A workaround when the impacted folder/dashboard is known is to remove the additional permissions manually.(CVE-2022-36062)\n\nGrafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform. Starting with version 5.0.0-beta1 and prior to versions 8.5.14 and 9.1.8, Grafana could leak the authentication cookie of users to plugins. The vulnerability impacts data source and plugin proxy endpoints under certain conditions. The destination plugin could receive a user&apos;s Grafana authentication cookie. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch for this issue. There are no known workarounds.(CVE-2022-39201)\n\nGrafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Versions prior to 9.2.4, or 8.5.15 on the 8.X branch, are subject to Improper Input Validation. Grafana admins can invite other members to the organization they are an admin for. When admins add members to the organization, non existing users get an email invite, existing members are added directly to the organization. When an invite link is sent, it allows users to sign up with whatever username/email address the user chooses and become a member of the organization. This introduces a vulnerability which can be used with malicious intent. This issue is patched in version 9.2.4, and has been backported to 8.5.15. There are no known workarounds.(CVE-2022-39306)\n\nGrafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. When using the forget password on the login page, a POST request is made to the `/api/user/password/sent-reset-email` URL. When the username or email does not exist, a JSON response contains a \u201cuser not found\u201d message. This leaks information to unauthenticated users and introduces a security risk. This issue has been patched in 9.2.4 and backported to 8.5.15. There are no known workarounds.(CVE-2022-39307)\n\nGrafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Prior to versions 8.5.16 and 9.2.8, malicious user can create a snapshot and arbitrarily choose the `originalUrl` parameter by editing the query, thanks to a web proxy. When another user opens the URL of the snapshot, they will be presented with the regular web interface delivered by the trusted Grafana server. The `Open original dashboard` button no longer points to the to the real original dashboard but to the attacker\u2019s injected URL. This issue is fixed in versions 8.5.16 and 9.2.8.(CVE-2022-39324)",
