While a minimal fix for this would be to add the gpiod_put() call, we can do better if we split device_register(), and use the tested nvmem_release() cleanup code by initialising the device early, and putting the device.  This results in a slightly larger fix, but results in clear code.  Note: this patch depends on \"nvmem: core: initialise nvmem->id early\" and \"nvmem: core: remove nvmem_config wp_gpio\".
