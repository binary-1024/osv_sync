However, if the primary is a block device while the extra device is a file-backed device, `erofs_init_device` will get an ENOTBLK, which is not treated as an error in `erofs_fc_get_tree`, and that leads to an UAF:    erofs_fc_get_tree     get_tree_bdev_flags(erofs_fc_fill_super)       erofs_read_superblock         erofs_init_device  // sbi->dif0 is not inited yet,                            // return -ENOTBLK       deactivate_locked_super         free(sbi)     if (err is -ENOTBLK)       sbi->dif0.file = filp_open()  // sbi UAF  So if -ENOTBLK is hitted in `erofs_init_device`, it means the primary device must be a block device, and the extra device is not a block device. The error can be converted to -EINVAL.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.35-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-38172.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.35-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-38172.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-38172"}]}
