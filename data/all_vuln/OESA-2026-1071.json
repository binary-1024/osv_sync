It was derived from GRUB, the GRand Unified Bootloader, which was originally designed and implemented by Erich Stefan Boleyn.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability has been identified in the GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) component. This flaw occurs because the bootloader mishandles string conversion when reading information from a USB device, allowing an attacker to exploit inconsistent length values. A local attacker can connect a maliciously configured USB device during the boot sequence to trigger this issue. A successful exploitation may lead GRUB to crash, leading to a Denial of Service. Data corruption may be also possible, although given the complexity of the exploit the impact is most likely limited.(CVE-2025-61661)\n\nA Use-After-Free vulnerability has been discovered in GRUB&apos;s gettext module. This flaw stems from a programming error where the gettext command remains registered in memory after its module is unloaded. An attacker can exploit this condition by invoking the orphaned command, causing the application to access a memory location that is no longer valid. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause grub to crash, leading to a Denial of Service. Possible data integrity or confidentiality compromise is not discarded.(CVE-2025-61662)\n\nA vulnerability has been identified in the GRUB2 bootloader&apos;s normal command that poses an immediate Denial of Service (DoS) risk. This flaw is a Use-after-Free issue, caused because the normal command is not properly unregistered when the module is unloaded. An attacker who can execute this command can force the system to access memory locations that are no longer valid. Successful exploitation leads directly to system instability, which can result in a complete crash and halt system availability. Impact on the data integrity and confidentiality is also not discarded.(CVE-2025-61663)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"grub2","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/grub2&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.04-43.oe2003sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["grub2-debuginfo-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","grub2-debugsource-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","grub2-efi-aa64-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","grub2-efi-aa64-cdboot-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","grub2-tools-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","grub2-tools-extra-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","grub2-tools-minimal-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["grub2-common-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.noarch.rpm","grub2-efi-aa64-modules-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.noarch.rpm","grub2-efi-ia32-modules-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.noarch.rpm","grub2-efi-x64-modules-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.noarch.rpm","grub2-help-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.noarch.rpm","grub2-pc-modules-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.noarch.rpm"],"src":["grub2-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["grub2-debuginfo-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","grub2-debugsource-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","grub2-efi-ia32-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","grub2-efi-ia32-cdboot-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","grub2-efi-x64-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","grub2-efi-x64-cdboot-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","grub2-pc-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","grub2-tools-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","grub2-tools-efi-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","grub2-tools-extra-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","grub2-tools-minimal-2.04-43.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2026-1071.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2026-1071"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61661"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61662"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61663"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
