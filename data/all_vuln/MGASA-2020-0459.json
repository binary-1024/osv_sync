  "details": "In sam2p 0.49.3, a heap-based buffer overflow exists in the pcxLoadImage24\nfunction of the file in_pcx.cpp. (CVE-2017-14628).\n\nIn sam2p 0.49.3, the in_xpm_reader function in in_xpm.cpp has an integer\nsignedness error, leading to a crash when writing to an out-of-bounds array\nelement. (CVE-2017-14629).\n\nIn sam2p 0.49.3, an integer overflow exists in the pcxLoadImage24 function\nof the file in_pcx.cpp, leading to an invalid write operation.\n(CVE-2017-14630).\n\nIn sam2p 0.49.3, the pcxLoadRaster function in in_pcx.cpp has an integer\nsignedness error leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. (CVE-2017-14631).\n\nBecause of an integer overflow in sam2p 0.49.3, a loop executes 0xffffffff\ntimes, ending with an invalid read of size 1 in the Image::Indexed::sortPal\nfunction in image.cpp. However, this also causes memory corruption becaus\nof an attempted write to the invalid d[0xfffffffe] array element.\n(CVE-2017-14636).\n\nIn sam2p 0.49.3, there is an invalid read of size 2 in the parse_rgb function\nin in_xpm.cpp. However, this can also cause a write to an illegal address.\n(CVE-2017-14637).\n\nIn sam2p 0.49.4, there are integer overflows (with resultant heap-based buffer\noverflows) in input-bmp.ci in the function ReadImage, because \"width * height\"\nmultiplications occur unsafely. (CVE-2017-16663).\n\nThere is a heap-based buffer overflow in the LoadPCX function of in_pcx.cpp\nin sam2p 0.49.4. A Crafted input will lead to a denial of service or possibly\nunspecified other impact. (CVE-2018-7487).\n\nThere is an invalid free in MiniPS::delete0 in minips.cpp that leads to a\nSegmentation fault in sam2p 0.49.4. A crafted input will lead to a denial of\nservice or possibly unspecified other impact. (CVE-2018-7551).\n\nThere is a heap-based buffer overflow in the pcxLoadRaster function of\nin_pcx.cpp in sam2p 0.49.4. A crafted input will lead to a denial of service\nor possibly unspecified other impact. (CVE-2018-7553).\n\nThere is an invalid free in ReadImage in input-bmp.ci that leads to a\nSegmentation fault in sam2p 0.49.4. A crafted input will lead to a denial of\nservice or possibly unspecified other impact. (CVE-2018-7554).\n\nThere is a heap-based buffer overflow in bmp_compress1_row in appliers.cpp\nin sam2p 0.49.4 that leads to a denial of service or possibly unspecified\nother impact. (CVE-2018-12578).\n\nThere is a heap-based buffer overflow in ReadImage in input-tga.ci in sam2p\n0.49.4 that leads to a denial of service or possibly unspecified other impact.\n(CVE-2018-12601).\n",
