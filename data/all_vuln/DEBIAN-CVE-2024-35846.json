The issue also cropped up in the bug trackers of libguestfs [1] and the Red Hat bugzilla [2].  The problem is that when memcg is disabled with the boot time flag, the zswap shrinker might get called with sc->memcg == NULL.  This is okay in many places, like the lruvec operations.  But it crashes in memcg_page_state() - which is only used due to the non-node accounting of cgroup's the zswap memory to begin with.  Nhat spotted that the memcg can be NULL in the memcg-disabled case, and I was then able to reproduce the crash locally as well.
