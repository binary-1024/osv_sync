  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring/memmap: cast nr_pages to size_t before shifting\n\nIf the allocated size exceeds UINT_MAX, then it's necessary to cast\nthe mr->nr_pages value to size_t to prevent it from overflowing. In\npractice this isn't much of a concern as the required memory size will\nhave been validated upfront, and accounted to the user. And > 4GB sizes\nwill be necessary to make the lack of a cast a problem, which greatly\nexceeds normal user locked_vm settings that are generally in the kb to\nmb range. However, if root is used, then accounting isn't done, and\nthen it's possible to hit this issue.",
