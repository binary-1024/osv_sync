In versions 2.4.2 and prior, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability would allow a remote attacker to launch a denial of service (DoS) attack. A buffer overflow vulnerability in the function `format_log_line` could allow remote attackers to cause a DoS on the affected system. Exploitation of the vulnerability can be triggered when the configuration file `cupsd.conf` sets the value of `loglevel `to `DEBUG`. No known patches or workarounds exist at time of publication.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"cups","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/cups?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.3.3-r7"}]}],"versions":["1.4.1-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.4.2-r1","1.4.2-r2","1.4.3-r0","1.4.3-r1","1.4.3-r2","1.4.3-r3","1.4.4-r0","1.4.4-r1","1.4.5-r0","1.4.6-r0","1.4.7-r0","1.4.8-r0","1.5.0-r0","1.5.0-r1","1.5.0-r2","1.5.2-r0","1.5.2-r1","1.5.2-r2","1.5.2-r3","1.5.3-r0","1.5.4-r0","1.5.4-r1","1.6.1-r0","1.6.1-r1","1.6.2-r0","1.6.2-r1","1.6.3-r0","1.6.4-r0","1.7.0-r0","1.7.0-r1","1.7.1-r0","1.7.2-r0","1.7.3-r0","1.7.3-r1","1.7.4-r0","1.7.5-r0","2.0.0-r0","2.0.1-r0","2.0.2-r0","2.0.2-r1","2.0.2-r2","2.0.3-r0","2.0.4-r0","2.1.0-r0","2.1.1-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.1.3-r0","2.1.3-r1","2.1.4-r0","2.2.1-r0","2.2.1-r1","2.2.10-r0","2.2.11-r0","2.2.12-r0","2.2.12-r1","2.2.12-r2","2.2.2-r0","2.2.2-r1","2.2.2-r2","2.2.3-r0","2.2.3-r1","2.2.4-r0","2.2.5-r0","2.2.5-r1","2.2.6-r0","2.2.9-r0","2.3.3-r0","2.3.3-r1","2.3.3-r2","2.3.3-r3","2.3.3-r4","2.3.3-r5","2.3.3-r6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-32324.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cups","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/cups?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.2-r1"}]}],"versions":["1.4.1-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.4.2-r1","1.4.2-r2","1.4.3-r0","1.4.3-r1","1.4.3-r2","1.4.3-r3","1.4.4-r0","1.4.4-r1","1.4.5-r0","1.4.6-r0","1.4.7-r0","1.4.8-r0","1.5.0-r0","1.5.0-r1","1.5.0-r2","1.5.2-r0","1.5.2-r1","1.5.2-r2","1.5.2-r3","1.5.3-r0","1.5.4-r0","1.5.4-r1","1.6.1-r0","1.6.1-r1","1.6.2-r0","1.6.2-r1","1.6.3-r0","1.6.4-r0","1.7.0-r0","1.7.0-r1","1.7.1-r0","1.7.2-r0","1.7.3-r0","1.7.3-r1","1.7.4-r0","1.7.5-r0","2.0.0-r0","2.0.1-r0","2.0.2-r0","2.0.2-r1","2.0.2-r2","2.0.3-r0","2.0.4-r0","2.1.0-r0","2.1.1-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.1.3-r0","2.1.3-r1","2.1.4-r0","2.2.1-r0","2.2.1-r1","2.2.10-r0","2.2.11-r0","2.2.12-r0","2.2.12-r1","2.2.12-r2","2.2.2-r0","2.2.2-r1","2.2.2-r2","2.2.3-r0","2.2.3-r1","2.2.4-r0","2.2.5-r0","2.2.5-r1","2.2.6-r0","2.2.9-r0","2.3.3-r0","2.3.3-r1","2.3.3-r2","2.3.3-r3","2.3.3-r4","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.1-r1","2.4.2-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-32324.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cups","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/cups?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.2-r2"}]}],"versions":["1.4.1-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.4.2-r1","1.4.2-r2","1.4.3-r0","1.4.3-r1","1.4.3-r2","1.4.3-r3","1.4.4-r0","1.4.4-r1","1.4.5-r0","1.4.6-r0","1.4.7-r0","1.4.8-r0","1.5.0-r0","1.5.0-r1","1.5.0-r2","1.5.2-r0","1.5.2-r1","1.5.2-r2","1.5.2-r3","1.5.3-r0","1.5.4-r0","1.5.4-r1","1.6.1-r0","1.6.1-r1","1.6.2-r0","1.6.2-r1","1.6.3-r0","1.6.4-r0","1.7.0-r0","1.7.0-r1","1.7.1-r0","1.7.2-r0","1.7.3-r0","1.7.3-r1","1.7.4-r0","1.7.5-r0","2.0.0-r0","2.0.1-r0","2.0.2-r0","2.0.2-r1","2.0.2-r2","2.0.3-r0","2.0.4-r0","2.1.0-r0","2.1.1-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.1.3-r0","2.1.3-r1","2.1.4-r0","2.2.1-r0","2.2.1-r1","2.2.10-r0","2.2.11-r0","2.2.12-r0","2.2.12-r1","2.2.12-r2","2.2.2-r0","2.2.2-r1","2.2.2-r2","2.2.3-r0","2.2.3-r1","2.2.4-r0","2.2.5-r0","2.2.5-r1","2.2.6-r0","2.2.9-r0","2.3.3-r0","2.3.3-r1","2.3.3-r2","2.3.3-r3","2.3.3-r4","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.1-r1","2.4.2-r0","2.4.2-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-32324.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cups","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/cups?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.2-r7"}]}],"versions":["1.4.1-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.4.2-r1","1.4.2-r2","1.4.3-r0","1.4.3-r1","1.4.3-r2","1.4.3-r3","1.4.4-r0","1.4.4-r1","1.4.5-r0","1.4.6-r0","1.4.7-r0","1.4.8-r0","1.5.0-r0","1.5.0-r1","1.5.0-r2","1.5.2-r0","1.5.2-r1","1.5.2-r2","1.5.2-r3","1.5.3-r0","1.5.4-r0","1.5.4-r1","1.6.1-r0","1.6.1-r1","1.6.2-r0","1.6.2-r1","1.6.3-r0","1.6.4-r0","1.7.0-r0","1.7.0-r1","1.7.1-r0","1.7.2-r0","1.7.3-r0","1.7.3-r1","1.7.4-r0","1.7.5-r0","2.0.0-r0","2.0.1-r0","2.0.2-r0","2.0.2-r1","2.0.2-r2","2.0.3-r0","2.0.4-r0","2.1.0-r0","2.1.1-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.1.3-r0","2.1.3-r1","2.1.4-r0","2.2.1-r0","2.2.1-r1","2.2.10-r0","2.2.11-r0","2.2.12-r0","2.2.12-r1","2.2.12-r2","2.2.2-r0","2.2.2-r1","2.2.2-r2","2.2.3-r0","2.2.3-r1","2.2.4-r0","2.2.5-r0","2.2.5-r1","2.2.6-r0","2.2.9-r0","2.3.3-r0","2.3.3-r1","2.3.3-r2","2.3.3-r3","2.3.3-r4","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.1-r1","2.4.2-r0","2.4.2-r1","2.4.2-r2","2.4.2-r3","2.4.2-r4","2.4.2-r5","2.4.2-r6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-32324.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cups","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/cups?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.2-r7"}]}],"versions":["1.4.1-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.4.2-r1","1.4.2-r2","1.4.3-r0","1.4.3-r1","1.4.3-r2","1.4.3-r
