  "details": "OpenJPEG is an open-source JPEG 2000 codec written in C language. It has been developed in order to promote the use of JPEG 2000, a still-image compression standard from the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG). Since April 2015, it is officially recognized by ISO/IEC and ITU-T as a JPEG 2000 Reference Software.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nThere is a flaw in the opj2_compress program in openjpeg2. An attacker who is able to submit a large number of image files to be processed in a directory by opj2_compress, could trigger a heap out-of-bounds write due to an integer overflow, which is caused by the large number of image files. The greatest threat posed by this flaw is to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.(CVE-2021-29338)",
