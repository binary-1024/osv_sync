In versions up to and including 1.1.0, every http request in addition to the session cookie `session` there included `nonce`. The value is not checked and validated by the backend, removing `nonce` allows the requests to be processed correctly. This may seem harmless, but if chained to other vulnerabilities it can become a critical vulnerability. Cross-site request forgery and cross-site scripting chained together can result in improper admin account creation. As of time of publication, no patched versions are available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/knadh/listmonk","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"b3612927c82bee987c2c2d20322232b9144a3c8a"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0-alpha","v0.1.1-alpha","v0.1.2-alpha","v0.2.0-alpha","v0.2.1-alpha","v0.2.2-alpha","v0.3.0-alpha","v0.3.1-alpha","v0.3.2-alpha","v0.3.3-alpha","v0.4.0-alpha","v0.5.0-alpha","v0.5.1-alpha","v0.5.2-alpha","v0.6.0-alpha","v0.6.1-alpha","v0.6.2-alpha","v0.7.0-alpha","v0.8.0-beta","v0.9.0-beta","v1.0.0","v1.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-58430.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/security/advisories/GHSA-rf24-wg77-gq7w"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-352","CWE-79","CWE-80"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
