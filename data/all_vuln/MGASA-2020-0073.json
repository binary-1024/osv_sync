  "details": "This update is based on upstream 5.4.17 and fixes at least the following\nsecurity vulnerabilities:\n\nIn a Linux KVM guest that has PV TLB enabled, a process in the guest kernel\nmay be able to read memory locations from another process in the same guest.\nThis problem is limit to the host running linux kernel 4.10 with a guest\nrunning linux kernel 4.16 or later. The problem mainly affects AMD\nprocessors but Intel CPUs cannot be ruled out (CVE-2019-3016).\n\nA heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel,\nin Marvell WiFi chip driver. A remote attacker could cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or, possibly execute arbitrary code, when the\nlbs_ibss_join_existing function is called after a STA connects to an AP\n(CVE-2019-14896).\n\nA stack-based buffer overflow was found in the Linux kernel, in Marvell\nWiFi chip driver. An attacker is able to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or, possibly execute arbitrary code, when a STA works in\nIBSS mode (allows connecting stations together without the use of an AP)\nand connects to another STA (CVE-2019-14897).\n\nfs/namei.c in the Linux kernel before 5.5 has a may_create_in_sticky\nuse-after-free, which allows local users to cause a denial of service\n(OOPS) or possibly obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, aka\nCID-d0cb50185ae9. One attack vector may be an open system call for a UNIX\ndomain socket, if the socket is being moved to a new parent directory and\nits old parent directory is being removed (CVE-2020-8428).\n\narm64/KVM debug registers vulnerability affecting systems with an ARMv8.1\nor later CPU (with the Virtualisation Host Extensions). The implications\nare that a guest, for a brief period, may be able to read event counters\nbelonging to the host or potentially trigger perf-related IRQs in the host\n(no CVE assigned yet).\n\nThere is also various fixes for crashing or hanging the kernel by malicious\nusers or devices.\n\nOther additional fixes and features in this update:\n\n- WireGuard kernel module has been updated to 0.0.20200128 and the tools\n  has been updated to 1.0.20200121.\n\n- platform/x86: asus_wmi: Support throttle thermal policy, and set to\n  default to avoid overheating and throttling\n\n- hwmon/k10temp: Support for additional temperature sensors as well as\n  voltage and current telemetry for Zen CPUs\n\n- hid: add Amd Sensor Fusion Hub Driver\n\n- e1000e: Revert \"e1000e: Make watchdog use delayed work\" as it causes\n  issues on some systems\n- e1000e: Add support for Comet Lake and Tiger Lake\n\n- x86/timer: Don't skip PIT setup when APIC is disabled or in legacy mode\n  (fixing PIT not being setup on some systems)\n\n- cifs: fix soft mounts hanging in the reconnect code\n\n- move kernel preun bits to postun to fix grub2 menu cleanup on kernel\n  uninstall (mga#16268)\n\nFor other upstream fixes in this update, see the referenced changelogs.\n",
