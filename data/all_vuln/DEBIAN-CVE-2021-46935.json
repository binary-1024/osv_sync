  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  binder: fix async_free_space accounting for empty parcels  In 4.13, commit 74310e06be4d (\"android: binder: Move buffer out of area shared with user space\") fixed a kernel structure visibility issue. As part of that patch, sizeof(void *) was used as the buffer size for 0-length data payloads so the driver could detect abusive clients sending 0-length asynchronous transactions to a server by enforcing limits on async_free_size.  Unfortunately, on the \"free\" side, the accounting of async_free_space did not add the sizeof(void *) back. The result was that up to 8-bytes of async_free_space were leaked on every async transaction of 8-bytes or less.  These small transactions are uncommon, so this accounting issue has gone undetected for several years.  The fix is to use \"buffer_size\" (the allocated buffer size) instead of \"size\" (the logical buffer size) when updating the async_free_space during the free operation. These are the same except for this corner case of asynchronous transactions with payloads < 8 bytes.",
