It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++ (or other languages, depending on the chosen implementation). Python is also usable as an extension language for applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use scripting or automation interfaces.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nThe Python standard library functions `urllib.parse.urlsplit` and `urlparse` accepted domain names that included square brackets which isn&apos;t valid according to RFC 3986. Square brackets are only meant to be used as delimiters for specifying IPv6 and IPvFuture hosts in URLs. This could result in differential parsing across the Python URL parser and other specification-compliant URL parsers.(CVE-2025-0938)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python3&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.11.6-10.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python3-3.11.6-10.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","python3-debug-3.11.6-10.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.11.6-10.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.11.6-10.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","python3-devel-3.11.6-10.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","python3-tkinter-3.11.6-10.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","python3-unversioned-command-3.11.6-10.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["python3-help-3.11.6-10.oe2403.noarch.rpm"],"src":["python3-3.11.6-10.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python3-3.11.6-10.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","python3-debug-3.11.6-10.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.11.6-10.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.11.6-10.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","python3-devel-3.11.6-10.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","python3-tkinter-3.11.6-10.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","python3-unversioned-command-3.11.6-10.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1150.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-1150"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-0938"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
