  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: cdc-acm: Check control transfer buffer size before access\n\nIf the first fragment is shorter than struct usb_cdc_notification, we can't\ncalculate an expected_size. Log an error and discard the notification\ninstead of reading lengths from memory outside the received data, which can\nlead to memory corruption when the expected_size decreases between\nfragments, causing `expected_size - acm->nb_index` to wrap.\n\nThis issue has been present since the beginning of git history; however,\nit only leads to memory corruption since commit ea2583529cd1\n(\"cdc-acm: reassemble fragmented notifications\").\n\nA mitigating factor is that acm_ctrl_irq() can only execute after userspace\nhas opened /dev/ttyACM*; but if ModemManager is running, ModemManager will\ndo that automatically depending on the USB device's vendor/product IDs and\nits other interfaces.",
