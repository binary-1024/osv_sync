{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-21698","published":"2022-02-15T16:15:08Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:16:54.794360Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-21698"],"details":"client_golang is the instrumentation library for Go applications in Prometheus, and the promhttp package in client_golang provides tooling around HTTP servers and clients. In client_golang prior to version 1.11.1, HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service through unbounded cardinality, and potential memory exhaustion, when handling requests with non-standard HTTP methods. In order to be affected, an instrumented software must use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware except `RequestsInFlight`; not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware; pass metric with `method` label name to our middleware; and not have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters away requests with unknown `method`. client_golang version 1.11.1 contains a patch for this issue. Several workarounds are available, including removing the `method` label name from counter/gauge used in the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected promhttp handlers; adding custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the request method given by Go http.Request; and using a reverse proxy or web application firewall, configured to only allow a limited set of methods.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"golang-github-prometheus-client-golang","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-prometheus-client-golang?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.11.0-1","1.11.0-2","1.11.0-3","1.11.1-1","1.11.1-1~bpo11+1","1.12.2-1","1.12.2-2","1.12.2-3","1.12.2-4","1.13.0-1","1.13.1-1","1.14.0-1","1.14.0-2","1.14.0-3","1.15.1-1","1.15.1-2","1.16.0-1","1.16.0-2","1.16.0-3","1.16.0-4","1.17.0-1","1.17.0-2","1.18.0-1","1.18.0-2","1.18.0-3","1.19.0-1","1.19.0-2","1.19.1-1","1.19.1-2","1.20.0-1","1.20.1-1","1.20.2-1","1.20.3-1","1.20.3-2","1.20.4-1","1.20.5-1","1.21.0-1","1.21.1-1","1.21.1-2~exp1","1.23.0-1","1.9.0-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-21698.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-prometheus-client-golang","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-prometheus-client-golang?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-21698.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-prometheus-client-golang","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-prometheus-client-golang?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-21698.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-prometheus-client-golang","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-prometheus-client-golang?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-21698.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-21698"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
