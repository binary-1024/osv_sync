  "details": "The ssh library was designed to be used by programmers needing a working SSH\nimplementation by the mean of a library. The complete control of the client is\nmade by the programmer. With libssh, you can remotely execute programs, transfer\nfiles, use a secure and transparent tunnel for your remote programs. With its\nSecure FTP implementation, you can play with remote files easily, without\nthird-party programs others than libcrypto (from openssl).\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA flaw was found in libssh when using the ChaCha20 cipher with the OpenSSL library. If an attacker manages to exhaust the heap space, this error is not detected and may lead to libssh using a partially initialized cipher context. This occurs because the OpenSSL error code returned aliases with the SSH_OK code, resulting in libssh not properly detecting the error returned by the OpenSSL library. This issue can lead to undefined behavior, including compromised data confidentiality and integrity or crashes.(CVE-2025-5987)",
