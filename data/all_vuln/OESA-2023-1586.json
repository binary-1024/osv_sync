A user located in the local network or with a high bandwidth connection can increase the CPU usage of the server that accepts IPV6 connections up to 95%.(CVE-2023-1206)\r\n\r\nA buffer overrun vulnerability was found in the netback driver in Xen due to an unusual split packet. This flaw allows an unprivileged guest to cause a denial of service (DoS) of the host by sending network packets to the backend, causing the backend to crash.(CVE-2023-34319)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.10. fs/smb/server/smb2misc.c in ksmbd does not validate the relationship between the command payload size and the RFC1002 length specification, leading to an out-of-bounds read.(CVE-2023-38432)\r\n\r\n(CVE-2023-3867)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in l2cap_sock_release in net/bluetooth/l2cap_sock.c in the Linux kernel before 6.4.10. There is a use-after-free because the children of an sk are mishandled.(CVE-2023-40283)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel&apos;s TUN/TAP functionality. This issue could allow a local user to bypass network filters and gain unauthorized access to some resources. The original patches fixing CVE-2023-1076 are incorrect or incomplete. The problem is that the following upstream commits - a096ccca6e50 (&quot;tun: tun_chr_open(): correctly initialize socket uid&quot;), - 66b2c338adce (&quot;tap: tap_open(): correctly initialize socket uid&quot;), pass &quot;inode-&gt;i_uid&quot; to sock_init_data_uid() as the last parameter and that turns out to not be accurate.(CVE-2023-4194)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kernel","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/kernel&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["bpftool-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","perf-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-devel-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-headers-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-source-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["kernel-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["kernel-tools-devel-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-headers-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-devel-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","perf-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-source-5.10.0-136.47.0.125.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2023-1586.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2023-1586"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1206"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34319"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38432"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3867"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40283"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4194"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Critical"}}
