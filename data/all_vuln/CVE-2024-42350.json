Third-party blocks can be generated without transferring the whole token to the third-party authority. Instead, a `ThirdPartyBlock` request can be sent, providing only the necessary info to generate a third-party block and to sign it: 1. the public key of the previous block (used in the signature), 2. the public keys part of the token symbol table (for public key interning in datalog expressions). A third-part block request forged by a malicious user can trick the third-party authority into generating datalog trusting the wrong keypair. Tokens with third-party blocks containing `trusted` annotations generated through a third party block request. This has been addressed in version 4 of the specification. Users are advised to update their implementations to conform. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-42350.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/biscuit-auth/biscuit/security/advisories/GHSA-rgqv-mwc3-c78m"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/biscuit-auth/biscuit/commit/c87cbb5d778964d6574df3e9e6579567cad12fff"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
