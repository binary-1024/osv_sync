Consequently, if\nthe device is removed while aes_battery_work is still pending, then hard\ncrashes or \"Oops: general protection fault...\" are experienced when\nwacom_aes_battery_handler() is finally called. E.g., this happens with\nbuilt-in USB devices after resume from hibernate when aes_battery_work\nwas still pending at the time of hibernation.\n\nSo, take care to cancel aes_battery_work in wacom_remove().",
