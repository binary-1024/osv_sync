{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-39251","published":"2022-09-28T20:15:16Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:17:14.445438Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-39251"],"details":"Matrix Javascript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. Prior to version 19.7.0, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages that legitimately appear to have come from another person, without any indication such as a grey shield. Additionally, a sophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted attack in order to send fake to-device messages appearing to originate from another user. This can allow, for example, to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification, to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver. These attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm. Starting with version 19.7.0, matrix-js-sdk has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages. Out of caution, several other checks have been audited or added. This attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker, so those who trust their home servers do not need a workaround.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"node-matrix-js-sdk","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-matrix-js-sdk?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["9.11.0+~cs9.9.16-1","9.11.0+~cs9.9.16-2","9.3.0+~cs9.9.16-2","9.7.0~~rc1+~cs9.9.16-1","9.7.0~~rc1+~cs9.9.16-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-39251.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-39251"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
