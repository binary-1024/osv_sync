  "details": "Updated java-1.8.0-openjdk packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nMultiple flaws were discovered in the CORBA, Libraries, RMI, Serialization,\nand 2D components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could\nuse these flaws to completely bypass Java sandbox restrictions\n(CVE-2015-4835, CVE-2015-4881, CVE-2015-4843, CVE-2015-4883, CVE-2015-4860,\nCVE-2015-4805, CVE-2015-4844).\n\nMultiple denial of service flaws were found in the JAXP component in\nOpenJDK. A specially crafted XML file could cause a Java application using\nJAXP to consume an excessive amount of CPU and memory when parsed\n(CVE-2015-4803, CVE-2015-4893, CVE-2015-4911).\n\nA flaw was found in the way the Libraries component in OpenJDK handled\ncertificate revocation lists (CRL). In certain cases, CRL checking code\ncould fail to report a revoked certificate, causing the application to\naccept it as trusted (CVE-2015-4868).\n\nIt was discovered that the Security component in OpenJDK failed to properly\ncheck if a certificate satisfied all defined constraints. In certain cases,\nthis could cause a Java application to accept an X.509 certificate which\ndoes not meet requirements of the defined policy (CVE-2015-4872).\n\nMultiple flaws were found in the Libraries, 2D, CORBA, JAXP, JGSS, and RMI\ncomponents in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use\nthese flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions (CVE-2015-4806,\nCVE-2015-4840, CVE-2015-4882, CVE-2015-4842, CVE-2015-4734, CVE-2015-4903).\n",
