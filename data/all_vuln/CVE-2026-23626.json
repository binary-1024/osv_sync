{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-23626","published":"2026-01-18T22:45:35.942Z","modified":"2026-01-20T05:50:31.984492Z","aliases":["GHSA-jg2j-2w24-54cg"],"summary":"Kimai Vulnerable to Authenticated Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)","details":"Kimai is a web-based multi-user time-tracking application. Prior to version 2.46.0, Kimai's export functionality uses a Twig sandbox with an overly permissive security policy (`DefaultPolicy`) that allows arbitrary method calls on objects available in the template context. An authenticated user with export permissions can deploy a malicious Twig template that extracts sensitive information including environment variables, all user password hashes, serialized session tokens, and CSRF tokens. Version 2.46.0 patches this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kimai/kimai","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6a86afb5fd79f6c1825060b87c09bd1909c2e86f"}]}],"versions":["0.1","0.2","0.3","0.4","0.5","0.6","0.6.1","0.7","0.8","0.8.1","0.9","1.0","1.0.1","1.1","1.10","1.10.1","1.10.2","1.11","1.11.1","1.12","1.13","1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.15.3","1.15.4","1.15.5","1.15.6","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.10","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.16.6","1.16.7","1.16.8","1.16.9","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.19.5","1.19.6","1.19.7","1.2","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.21.0","1.22.0","1.22.1","1.23.0","1.23.1","1.24.0","1.25.0","1.26.0","1.27.0","1.28.0","1.28.1","1.29.0","1.29.1","1.3","1.30.0","1.30.1","1.30.4","1.4","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.5","1.6","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.7","1.8","1.9","2.0.0","2.0.0-alpha","2.0.0-beta","2.0.0-beta-2","2.0.0-beta-3","2.0.0-rc-1","2.0.1","2.0.10","2.0.11","2.0.12","2.0.13","2.0.14","2.0.15","2.0.16","2.0.17","2.0.18","2.0.19","2.0.2","2.0.20","2.0.21","2.0.22","2.0.23","2.0.24","2.0.25","2.0.26","2.0.27","2.0.28","2.0.29","2.0.3","2.0.30","2.0.31","2.0.32","2.0.33","2.0.34","2.0.35","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.0.6","2.0.7","2.0.8","2.0.9","2.1.0","2.10.0","2.11.0","2.12.0","2.13.0","2.14.0","2.15.0","2.16.0","2.16.1","2.17.0","2.18.0","2.19.0","2.19.1","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.20.0","2.20.1","2.21.0","2.22.0","2.23.0","2.24.0","2.25.0","2.26.0","2.27.0","2.28.0","2.29.0","2.3.0","2.30.0","2.31.0","2.32.0","2.33.0","2.34.0","2.35.0","2.35.1","2.36.0","2.36.1","2.37.0","2.38.0","2.39.0","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.40.0","2.41.0","2.42.0","2.43.0","2.44.0","2.45.0","2.5.0","2.6.0","2.7.0","2.8.0","2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23626.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23626.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/kimai/kimai/commit/6a86afb5fd79f6c1825060b87c09bd1909c2e86f"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/kimai/kimai/pull/5757"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/kimai/kimai/releases/tag/2.46.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/kimai/kimai/security/advisories/GHSA-jg2j-2w24-54cg"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23626"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-1336"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23626.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
