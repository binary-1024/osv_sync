DNS over HTTPS is not enabled by default, and backends are using plain DNS (Do53) by default.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://dnsdist.org/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-for-dnsdist-2024-03.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/13/1"}]}
