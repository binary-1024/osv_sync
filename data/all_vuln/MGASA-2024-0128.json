  "details": "CVE-2023-45288: An attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read\narbitrary amounts of header data by sending an excessive number of\nCONTINUATION frames. Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and\nprocessing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a\nrequest's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store\nthe excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker\nto cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data,\nall associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These\nheaders can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more\nexpensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The\nfix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process\nbefore closing a connection.\n",
