  "details": "This  provides support for the Tag Image File Format (TIFF), a widely\nused format for storing image data. The latest version of the TIFF specification\nis available on-line in several different formats.And contains command-line programs\nfor manipulating TIFF format image files using the libtiff library.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability classified as problematic was found in libtiff 4.6.0 (Image Processing Software).The CWE definition for the vulnerability is CWE-476. A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, typically causing a crash or exit.As an impact it is known to affect availability.It is possible to download the exploit at drive.google.com. It is declared as proof-of-concept. One of the maintainers explains, that &quot;[t]his error only occurs if DEFER_STRILE_LOAD (defer-strile-load:BOOL=ON) or TIFFOpen( .. &quot;rD&quot;) option is used.&quot;Applying the patch 6ba36f159fd396ad11bf6b7874554197736ecc8b is able to eliminate this problem. The bugfix is ready for download at gitlab.com.(CVE-2025-8534)\n\nA vulnerability was found in LibTIFF up to 4.5.1 (Image Processing Software). It has been rated as critical.Using CWE to declare the problem leads to CWE-121. A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).Impacted is confidentiality, integrity, and availability.Applying the patch 8a7a48d7a645992ca83062b3a1873c951661e2b3 is able to eliminate this problem. The bugfix is ready for download at gitlab.com.(CVE-2025-8851)",
