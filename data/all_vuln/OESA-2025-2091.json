The latest version of the TIFF specification\nis available on-line in several different formats.And contains command-line programs\nfor manipulating TIFF format image files using the libtiff library.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability classified as problematic was found in libtiff 4.6.0 (Image Processing Software).The CWE definition for the vulnerability is CWE-476. A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, typically causing a crash or exit.As an impact it is known to affect availability.It is possible to download the exploit at drive.google.com. It is declared as proof-of-concept. One of the maintainers explains, that &quot;[t]his error only occurs if DEFER_STRILE_LOAD (defer-strile-load:BOOL=ON) or TIFFOpen( .. &quot;rD&quot;) option is used.&quot;Applying the patch 6ba36f159fd396ad11bf6b7874554197736ecc8b is able to eliminate this problem.
