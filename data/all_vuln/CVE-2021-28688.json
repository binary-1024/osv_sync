This initialization went too far and may under certain conditions also overwrite pointers which are in need of cleaning up. The lack of cleanup would result in leaking persistent grants. The leak in turn would prevent fully cleaning up after a respective guest has died, leaving around zombie domains. All Linux versions having the fix for XSA-365 applied are vulnerable. XSA-365 was classified to affect versions back to at least 3.11.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/06/msg00019.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/06/msg00020.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-371.txt"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
