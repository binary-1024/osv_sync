  "details": "### Impact\n\nA malicious user could feed a specially crafted archive to this library causing RCE, modification of files or other bad things in the context of whatever user is running this library as, through the program that imports it.\n\nThe severity highly depends on the user's permissions and environment it is being ran in (e.g., non root, read only root container would likely have no impact vs running something as root on a production system).\n\nThe severity is also dependent on **arbitrary archives** being passed or not.\n\nBased on the above, severity high was picked to be safe.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched with the help of snyk and gosec in v1.0.1\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe only workaround is to manually validate archives before submitting them to this library, however that is not recommended vs upgrading to unaffected versions.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://security.snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability",
