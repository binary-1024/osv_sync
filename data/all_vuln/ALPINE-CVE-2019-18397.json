Examples include any GNOME or GTK+ based application that uses Pango for text layout, as this internally uses FriBidi for bidirectional text layout. For example, the attacker can construct a crafted text file to be opened in GEdit, or a crafted IRC message to be viewed in HexChat.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"fribidi","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/fribidi?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.5-r2"}]}],"versions":["0.19.2-r0","0.19.2-r1","0.19.2-r2","0.19.2-r3","0.19.2-r4","0.19.2-r5","0.19.4-r0","0.19.5-r0","0.19.5-r1","0.19.5-r2","0.19.6-r0","0.19.6-r1","0.19.7-r0","0.19.7-r1","1.0.1-r0","1.0.2-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.5-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-18397.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fribidi","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/fribidi?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.7-r1"}]}],"versions":["0.19.2-r0","0.19.2-r1","0.19.2-r2","0.19.2-r3","0.19.2-r4","0.19.2-r5","0.19.4-r0","0.19.5-r0","0.19.5-r1","0.19.5-r2","0.19.6-r0","0.19.6-r1","0.19.7-r0","0.19.7-r1","1.0.1-r0","1.0.2-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.5-r1","1.0.7-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-18397.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fribidi","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/fribidi?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.7-r1"}]}],"versions":["0.19.2-r0","0.19.2-r1","0.19.2-r2","0.19.2-r3","0.19.2-r4","0.19.2-r5","0.19.4-r0","0.19.5-r0","0.19.5-r1","0.19.5-r2","0.19.6-r0","0.19.6-r1","0.19.7-r0","0.19.7-r1","1.0.1-r0","1.0.2-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.5-r1","1.0.7-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-18397.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fribidi","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/fribidi?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.7-r1"}]}],"versions":["0.19.2-r0","0.19.2-r1","0.19.2-r2","0.19.2-r3","0.19.2-r4","0.19.2-r5","0.19.4-r0","0.19.5-r0","0.19.5-r1","0.19.5-r2","0.19.6-r0","0.19.6-r1","0.19.7-r0","0.19.7-r1","1.0.1-r0","1.0.2-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.5-r1","1.0.7-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-18397.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fribidi","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/fribidi?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.7-r1"}]}],"versions":["0.19.2-r0","0.19.2-r1","0.19.2-r2","0.19.2-r3","0.19.2-r4","0.19.2-r5","0.19.4-r0","0.19.5-r0","0.19.5-r1","0.19.5-r2","0.19.6-r0","0.19.6-r1","0.19.7-r0","0.19.7-r1","1.0.1-r0","1.0.2-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.5-r1","1.0.7-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-18397.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fribidi","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/fribidi?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.7-r1"}]}],"versions":["0.19.2-r0","0.19.2-r1","0.19.2-r2","0.19.2-r3","0.19.2-r4","0.19.2-r5","0.19.4-r0","0.19.5-r0","0.19.5-r1","0.19.5-r2","0.19.6-r0","0.19.6-r1","0.19.7-r0","0.19.7-r1","1.0.1-r0","1.0.2-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.5-r1","1.0.7-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-18397.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fribidi","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/fribidi?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.7-r1"}]}],"versions":["0.19.2-r0","0.19.2-r1","0.19.2-r2","0.19.2-r3","0.19.2-r4","0.19.2-r5","0.19.4-r0","0.19.5-r0","0.19.5-r1","0.19.5-r2","0.19.6-r0","0.19.6-r1","0.19.7-r0","0.19.7-r1","1.0.1-r0","1.0.2-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.5-r1","1.0.7-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-18397.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fribidi","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/fribidi?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.7-r1"}]}],"versions":["0.19.2-r0","0.19.2-r1","0.19.2-r2","0.19.2-r3","0.19.2-r4","0.19.2-r5","0.19.4-r0","0.19.5-r0","0.19.5-r1","0.19.5-r2","0.19.6-r0","0.19.6-r1","0.19.7-r0","0.19.7-r1","1.0.1-r0","1.0.2-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.5-r1","1.0.7-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-18397.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fribidi","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/fribidi?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.7-r1"}]}],"versions":["0.19.2-r0","0.19.2-r1","0.19.2-r2","0.19.2-r3","0.19.2-r4","0.19.2-r5","0.19.4-r0","0.19.5-r0","0.19.5-r1","0.19.5-r2","0.19.6-r0","0.19.6-r1","0.19.7-r0","0.19.7-r1","1.0.1-r0","1.0.2-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.5-r1","1.0.7-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-18397.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fribidi","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/fribidi?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"intr
