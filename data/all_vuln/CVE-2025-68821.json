However in doing so, fuse_prepare_release() now skips\ngrabbing the reference on the inode, which makes it possible for an\ninode to be evicted from the dcache while there are inflight readahead\nrequests. This causes a deadlock if the server triggers reclaim while\nservicing the readahead request and reclaim attempts to evict the inode\nof the file being read ahead. Since the folio is locked during\nreadahead, when reclaim evicts the fuse inode and fuse_evict_inode()\nattempts to remove all folios associated with the inode from the page\ncache (truncate_inode_pages_range()), reclaim will block forever waiting\nfor the lock since readahead cannot relinquish the lock because it is\nitself blocked in reclaim:\n\n>>> stack_trace(1504735)\n folio_wait_bit_common (mm/filemap.c:1308:4)\n folio_lock (./include/linux/pagemap.h:1052:3)\n truncate_inode_pages_range (mm/truncate.c:336:10)\n fuse_evict_inode (fs/fuse/inode.c:161:2)\n evict (fs/inode.c:704:3)\n dentry_unlink_inode (fs/dcache.c:412:3)\n __dentry_kill (fs/dcache.c:615:3)\n shrink_kill (fs/dcache.c:1060:12)\n shrink_dentry_list (fs/dcache.c:1087:3)\n prune_dcache_sb (fs/dcache.c:1168:2)\n super_cache_scan (fs/super.c:221:10)\n do_shrink_slab (mm/shrinker.c:435:9)\n shrink_slab (mm/shrinker.c:626:10)\n shrink_node (mm/vmscan.c:5951:2)\n shrink_zones (mm/vmscan.c:6195:3)\n do_try_to_free_pages (mm/vmscan.c:6257:3)\n do_swap_page (mm/memory.c:4136:11)\n handle_pte_fault (mm/memory.c:5562:10)\n handle_mm_fault (mm/memory.c:5870:9)\n do_user_addr_fault (arch/x86/mm/fault.c:1338:10)\n handle_page_fault (arch/x86/mm/fault.c:1481:3)\n exc_page_fault (arch/x86/mm/fault.c:1539:2)\n asm_exc_page_fault+0x22/0x27\n\nFix this deadlock by allocating ff->release_args and grabbing the\nreference on the inode when preparing the file for release even if the\nserver does not implement open.
