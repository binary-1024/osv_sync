  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rds: sysctl: rds_tcp_{rcv,snd}buf: avoid using current->nsproxy  As mentioned in a previous commit of this series, using the 'net' structure via 'current' is not recommended for different reasons:  - Inconsistency: getting info from the reader's/writer's netns vs only   from the opener's netns.  - current->nsproxy can be NULL in some cases, resulting in an 'Oops'   (null-ptr-deref), e.g. when the current task is exiting, as spotted by   syzbot [1] using acct(2).  The per-netns structure can be obtained from the table->data using container_of(), then the 'net' one can be retrieved from the listen socket (if available).",
