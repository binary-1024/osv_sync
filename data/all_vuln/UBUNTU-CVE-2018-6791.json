When a vfat thumbdrive that contains `` or $() in its volume label is plugged in and mounted through the device notifier, it's interpreted as a shell command, leading to a possibility of arbitrary command execution. An example of an offending volume label is \"$(touch b)\" -- this will create a file called b in the home folder.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"plasma-workspace","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/plasma-workspace@4:5.5.5.2-0ubuntu1.1?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4:5.5.5.2-0ubuntu1.1"}]}],"versions":["4:5.4.2-0ubuntu1","4:5.4.3-0ubuntu1","4:5.5.4-0ubuntu1","4:5.5.5.2-0ubuntu1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"libkworkspace5-5","binary_version":"4:5.5.5.2-0ubuntu1.1"},{"binary_name":"libplasma-geolocation-interface5","binary_version":"4:5.5.5.2-0ubuntu1.1"},{"binary_name":"libtaskmanager5","binary_version":"4:5.5.5.2-0ubuntu1.1"},{"binary_name":"libweather-ion7","binary_version":"4:5.5.5.2-0ubuntu1.1"},{"binary_name":"plasma-workspace","binary_version":"4:5.5.5.2-0ubuntu1.1"},{"binary_name":"plasma-workspace-dev","binary_version":"4:5.5.5.2-0ubuntu1.1"},{"binary_name":"plasma-workspace-wayland","binary_version":"4:5.5.5.2-0ubuntu1.1"},{"binary_name":"sddm-theme-breeze","binary_version":"4:5.5.5.2-0ubuntu1.1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2018/UBUNTU-CVE-2018-6791.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-6791"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-6791"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
