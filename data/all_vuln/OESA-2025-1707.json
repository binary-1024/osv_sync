The complete control of the client is made by the programmer. With libssh, you can remotely execute programs, transfer files, use a secure and transparent tunnel for your remote programs. With its Secure FTP implementation, you can play with remote files easily, without third-party programs others than libcrypto (from openssl).\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA flaw was found in the libssh library. An out-of-bounds read can be triggered in the sftp_handle function due to an incorrect comparison check that permits the function to access memory beyond the valid handle list and to return an invalid pointer, which is used in further processing. This vulnerability allows an authenticated remote attacker to potentially read unintended memory regions, exposing sensitive information or affect service behavior.(CVE-2025-5318)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/libssh&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.9.4-10.oe2003sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libssh-0.9.4-10.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libssh-debuginfo-0.9.4-10.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libssh-debugsource-0.9.4-10.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","libssh-devel-0.9.4-10.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["libssh-help-0.9.4-10.oe2003sp4.noarch.rpm"],"src":["libssh-0.9.4-10.oe2003sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libssh-0.9.4-10.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libssh-debuginfo-0.9.4-10.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libssh-debugsource-0.9.4-10.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","libssh-devel-0.9.4-10.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1707.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-1707"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-5318"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
