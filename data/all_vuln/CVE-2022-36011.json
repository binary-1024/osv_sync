When `mlir::tfg::ConvertGenericFunctionToFunctionDef` is given empty function attributes, it gives a null dereference. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 1cf45b831eeb0cab8655c9c7c5d06ec6f45fc41b. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1cf45b831eeb0cab8655c9c7c5d06ec6f45fc41b"}]}],"versions":["0.12.0-rc0","0.12.0-rc1","0.12.1","0.5.0","0.6.0","v0.10.0","v0.10.0rc0","v0.11.0","v0.11.0rc0","v0.11.0rc1","v0.11.0rc2","v0.12.0","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.8.0rc0","v0.9.0","v0.9.0rc0","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-alpha","v1.0.0-rc0","v1.0.0-rc1","v1.0.0-rc2","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-rc0","v1.1.0-rc1","v1.1.0-rc2","v1.12.0","v1.12.0-rc0","v1.12.0-rc1","v1.12.0-rc2","v1.12.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-rc0","v1.2.0-rc1","v1.2.0-rc2","v1.3.0-rc0","v1.3.0-rc1","v1.5.0","v1.5.0-rc0","v1.5.0-rc1","v1.6.0","v1.6.0-rc0","v1.6.0-rc1","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-rc0","v1.7.0-rc1","v1.8.0","v1.8.0-rc0","v1.8.0-rc1","v1.9.0","v1.9.0-rc0","v1.9.0-rc1","v1.9.0-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-36011.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["69961143782839281398375027575839453367","293478035648335144336960100913860863004","2339851476671807669589178450959699289","83500935463003940730392947884483277929"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2022-36011-ff7e9934","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1cf45b831eeb0cab8655c9c7c5d06ec6f45fc41b","target":{"file":"tensorflow/core/ir/importexport/functiondef_import.cc"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/36xxx/CVE-2022-36011.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1cf45b831eeb0cab8655c9c7c5d06ec6f45fc41b"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-fv43-93gv-vm8f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36011"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-476"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/36xxx/CVE-2022-36011.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
