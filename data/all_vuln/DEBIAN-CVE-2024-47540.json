An uninitialized stack variable vulnerability has been identified in the gst_matroska_demux_add_wvpk_header function within matroska-demux.c. When size < 4, the program calls gst_buffer_unmap with an uninitialized map variable. Then, in the gst_memory_unmap function, the program will attempt to unmap the buffer using the uninitialized map variable, causing a function pointer hijack, as it will jump to mem->allocator->mem_unmap_full or mem->allocator->mem_unmap. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to hijack the execution flow, potentially leading to code execution. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-good1.0","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gst-plugins-good1.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.18.4-2+deb11u3"}]}],"versions":["1.18.4-2","1.18.4-2+deb11u1","1.18.4-2+deb11u2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47540.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-good1.0","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gst-plugins-good1.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.22.0-5+deb12u2"}]}],"versions":["1.22.0-5","1.22.0-5+deb12u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47540.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-good1.0","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gst-plugins-good1.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.24.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47540.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-good1.0","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gst-plugins-good1.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.24.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-47540.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-47540"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
