These scripts are executed in a victim’s browser when they open the page containing the vulnerable field. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account takeover of the admin and due to other vulnerability (Improper Access Control on Private notes) a low privileged user can update the private notes which could lead to privilege escalation.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"dolibarr","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/dolibarr@3.5.8+dfsg1-1ubuntu1?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.5.5+dfsg1-2","3.5.7+dfsg1-1","3.5.8+dfsg1-1","3.5.8+dfsg1-1ubuntu1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"dolibarr","binary_version":"3.5.8+dfsg1-1ubuntu1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2021/UBUNTU-CVE-2021-25955.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-25955"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2021-25955"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-25955"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
