  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Increase block_sequence array size  [Why] It's possible to generate more than 50 steps in hwss_build_fast_sequence, for example with a 6-pipe asic where all pipes are in one MPC chain. This overflows the block_sequence buffer and corrupts block_sequence_steps, causing a crash.  [How] Expand block_sequence to 100 items. A naive upper bound on the possible number of steps for a 6-pipe asic, ignoring the potential for steps to be mutually exclusive, is 91 with current code, therefore 100 is sufficient.",
