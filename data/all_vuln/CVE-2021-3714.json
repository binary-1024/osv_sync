Previous work has shown that memory deduplication can be attacked via a local exploitation mechanism. The same technique can be used if an attacker can upload page sized files and detect the change in access time from a networked service to determine if the page has been merged.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-3714"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08553"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.08553.pdf"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1931327"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
