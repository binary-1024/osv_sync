When a PortalUserObject is connected to a PimcoreUser and \"Use Pimcore Backend Password\" is set to true, the change password function in Portal Profile sets the new password. Prior to Pimcore portal engine versions 4.1.7 and 3.1.16, the password is then set without hashing so it can be read by everyone. Everyone who combines PortalUser to PimcoreUsers and change passwords via profile settings could be affected. Versions 4.1.7 and 3.1.16 of the Pimcore portal engine fix the issue.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-49370.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.16"}],"type":""},{"events":[{"introduced":"4.0.0"},{"fixed":"4.1.7"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/security/advisories/GHSA-74p5-77rq-gfqc"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
