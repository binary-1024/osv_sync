  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncfg80211: fix race in netlink owner interface destruction\n\nMy previous fix here to fix the deadlock left a race where\nthe exact same deadlock (see the original commit referenced\nbelow) can still happen if cfg80211_destroy_ifaces() already\nruns while nl80211_netlink_notify() is still marking some\ninterfaces as nl_owner_dead.\n\nThe race happens because we have two loops here - first we\ndev_close() all the netdevs, and then we destroy them. If we\nalso have two netdevs (first one need only be a wdev though)\nthen we can find one during the first iteration, close it,\nand go to the second iteration -- but then find two, and try\nto destroy also the one we didn't close yet.\n\nFix this by only iterating once.",
