The update introduced a\nregression in the UEFI network boot. This update reverts the corresponding\nfixes for CVE-2023-45236 and CVE-2023-45237 pending further investigation.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that EDK II was susceptible to a predictable TCP Initial\n Sequence Number. An attacker could possibly use this issue to gain\n unauthorized access. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu\n 24.04 LTS. (CVE-2023-45236, CVE-2023-45237)\n\n It was discovered that EDK II incorrectly handled S3 sleep. An attacker\n could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only\n affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-1298)\n\n It was discovered that the EDK II PE/COFF loader incorrectly handled\n certain memory operations. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\n cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive information, or execute\n arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu\n 24.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-38796)\n\n It was discovered that the EDK II PE image hashing function incorrectly\n handled certain memory operations. An attacker could possibly use this\n issue to cause a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code.\n (CVE-2024-38797)\n\n It was discovered that the EDK II BIOS incorrectly handled certain memory\n operations. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of\n service. (CVE-2024-38805, CVE-2025-2295)\n\n It was discovered that EDK II incorrectly handled the enabling of MCE. An\n attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service, or\n execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2025-3770)\n\n It was discovered that the OpenSSL library embedded in EDK II contained\n multiple vulnerabilties. An attacker could possibly use these issues to\n cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive information, or execute\n arbitrary code.
