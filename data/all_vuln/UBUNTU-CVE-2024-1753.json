A malicious Containerfile can use a dummy image with a symbolic link to the root filesystem as a mount source and cause the mount operation to mount the host root filesystem inside the RUN step. The commands inside the RUN step will then have read-write access to the host filesystem, allowing for full container escape at build time.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"golang-github-containers-buildah","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:22.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/golang-github-containers-buildah@1.23.1+ds1-2?arch=source&distro=jammy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.21.3+ds1-1ubuntu1","1.23.1+ds1-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"buildah","binary_version":"1.23.1+ds1-2"},{"binary_name":"golang-github-containers-buildah-dev","binary_version":"1.23.1+ds1-2"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2024/UBUNTU-CVE-2024-1753.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-containers-buildah","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:Pro:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/golang-github-containers-buildah@1.33.7+ds1-1ubuntu0.24.04.3+esm2?arch=source&distro=esm-apps/noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.28.2+ds1-3build1","1.32.2+ds1-1","1.33.1+ds1-2","1.33.3+ds1-2","1.33.5+ds1-4","1.33.5+ds1-4build1","1.33.5+ds1-4build2","1.33.7+ds1-1","1.33.7+ds1-1ubuntu0.24.04.1","1.33.7+ds1-1ubuntu0.24.04.2","1.33.7+ds1-1ubuntu0.24.04.2+esm1","1.33.7+ds1-1ubuntu0.24.04.2+esm2","1.33.7+ds1-1ubuntu0.24.04.3","1.33.7+ds1-1ubuntu0.24.04.3+esm2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"buildah","binary_version":"1.33.7+ds1-1ubuntu0.24.04.3+esm2"},{"binary_name":"golang-github-containers-buildah-dev","binary_version":"1.33.7+ds1-1ubuntu0.24.04.3+esm2"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2024/UBUNTU-CVE-2024-1753.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-containers-buildah","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.10","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/golang-github-containers-buildah@1.39.3+ds1-1syncable1?arch=source&distro=questing"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.39.3+ds1-1syncable1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"buildah","binary_version":"1.39.3+ds1-1syncable1"},{"binary_name":"golang-github-containers-buildah-dev","binary_version":"1.39.3+ds1-1syncable1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2024/UBUNTU-CVE-2024-1753.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-1753"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/containers/buildah/security/advisories/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-1753"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2265513"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/containers/podman/security/advisories/GHSA-874v-pj72-92f3"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1753"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
