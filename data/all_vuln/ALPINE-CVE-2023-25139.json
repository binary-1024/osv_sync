This is unrelated to CWE-676. It may write beyond the bounds of the destination buffer when attempting to write a padded, thousands-separated string representation of a number, if the buffer is allocated the exact size required to represent that number as a string. For example, 1,234,567 (with padding to 13) overflows by two bytes.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mpfr4","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mpfr4?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.2.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.0.2-r1","4.0.2-r2","4.0.2-r3","4.0.2-r4","4.1.0-r0","4.1.1-r0","4.1.1-r1","4.2.0-r0","4.2.0-r1","4.2.0-r2","4.2.0-r3","4.2.0_p12-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-25139.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mpfr4","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mpfr4?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.2.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.0.2-r1","4.0.2-r2","4.0.2-r3","4.0.2-r4","4.1.0-r0","4.1.1-r0","4.1.1-r1","4.2.0-r0","4.2.0-r1","4.2.0-r2","4.2.0-r3","4.2.0_p12-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-25139.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mpfr4","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mpfr4?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.2.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.0.2-r1","4.0.2-r2","4.0.2-r3","4.0.2-r4","4.1.0-r0","4.1.1-r0","4.1.1-r1","4.2.0-r0","4.2.0-r1","4.2.0-r2","4.2.0-r3","4.2.0_p12-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-25139.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mpfr4","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mpfr4?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.2.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["4.0.2-r1","4.0.2-r2","4.0.2-r3","4.0.2-r4","4.1.0-r0","4.1.1-r0","4.1.1-r1","4.2.0-r0","4.2.0-r1","4.2.0-r2","4.2.0-r3","4.2.0_p12-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-25139.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2023-25139"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
