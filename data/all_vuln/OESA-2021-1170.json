When using a HTTPS proxy and TLS 1.3, libcurl can confuse session tickets arriving from the HTTPS proxy but work as if they arrived from the remote server and then wrongly &quot;short-cut&quot; the host handshake. When confusing the tickets, a HTTPS proxy can trick libcurl to use the wrong session ticket resume for the host and thereby circumvent the server TLS certificate check and make a MITM attack to be possible to perform unnoticed. Note that such a malicious HTTPS proxy needs to provide a certificate that curl will accept for the MITMed server for an attack to work - unless curl has been told to ignore the server certificate check.(CVE-2021-22890)\r\n\r\ncurl 7.1.1 to and including 7.75.0 is vulnerable to an &quot;Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor&quot; by leaking credentials in the HTTP Referer: header. libcurl does not strip off user credentials from the URL when automatically populating the Referer: HTTP request header field in outgoing HTTP requests, and therefore risks leaking sensitive data to the server that is the target of the second HTTP request.(CVE-2021-22876)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/curl&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.71.1-6.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["curl-7.71.1-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm","curl-debugsource-7.71.1-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm","curl-debuginfo-7.71.1-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libcurl-devel-7.71.1-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libcurl-7.71.1-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["curl-help-7.71.1-6.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["curl-7.71.1-6.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["curl-debuginfo-7.71.1-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libcurl-devel-7.71.1-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm","curl-debugsource-7.71.1-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libcurl-7.71.1-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm","curl-7.71.1-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1170.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1170"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22890"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22876"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
