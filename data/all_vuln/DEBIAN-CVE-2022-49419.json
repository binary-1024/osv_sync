  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  video: fbdev: vesafb: Fix a use-after-free due early fb_info cleanup  Commit b3c9a924aab6 (\"fbdev: vesafb: Cleanup fb_info in .fb_destroy rather than .remove\") fixed a use-after-free error due the vesafb driver freeing the fb_info in the .remove handler instead of doing it in .fb_destroy.  This can happen if the .fb_destroy callback is executed after the .remove callback, since the former tries to access a pointer freed by the latter.  But that change didn't take into account that another possible scenario is that .fb_destroy is called before the .remove callback. For example, if no process has the fbdev chardev opened by the time the driver is removed.  If that's the case, fb_info will be freed when unregister_framebuffer() is called, making the fb_info pointer accessed in vesafb_remove() after that to no longer be valid.  To prevent that, move the expression containing the info->par to happen before the unregister_framebuffer() function call.",
