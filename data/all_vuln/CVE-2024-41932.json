  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched: fix warning in sched_setaffinity\n\nCommit 8f9ea86fdf99b added some logic to sched_setaffinity that included\na WARN when a per-task affinity assignment races with a cpuset update.\n\nSpecifically, we can have a race where a cpuset update results in the\ntask affinity no longer being a subset of the cpuset. That's fine; we\nhave a fallback to instead use the cpuset mask. However, we have a WARN\nset up that will trigger if the cpuset mask has no overlap at all with\nthe requested task affinity. This shouldn't be a warning condition; its\ntrivial to create this condition.\n\nReproduced the warning by the following setup:\n\n- $PID inside a cpuset cgroup\n- another thread repeatedly switching the cpuset cpus from 1-2 to just 1\n- another thread repeatedly setting the $PID affinity (via taskset) to 2",
