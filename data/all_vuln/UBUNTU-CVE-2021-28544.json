When a node has been copied from a protected location, users with access to the copy can see the 'copyfrom' path of the original. This also reveals the fact that the node was copied. Only the 'copyfrom' path is revealed; not its contents. Both httpd and svnserve servers are vulnerable.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"subversion","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:20.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/subversion@1.13.0-3ubuntu0.1?arch=source&distro=focal"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.13.0-3ubuntu0.1"}]}],"versions":["1.10.6-1","1.10.6-1build1","1.13.0-1","1.13.0-1ubuntu1","1.13.0-2","1.13.0-2ubuntu2","1.13.0-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"libapache2-mod-svn","binary_version":"1.13.0-3ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"libsvn-dev","binary_version":"1.13.0-3ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"libsvn-java","binary_version":"1.13.0-3ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"libsvn-perl","binary_version":"1.13.0-3ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"libsvn1","binary_version":"1.13.0-3ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"python-subversion","binary_version":"1.13.0-3ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"ruby-svn","binary_version":"1.13.0-3ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"subversion","binary_version":"1.13.0-3ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"subversion-tools","binary_version":"1.13.0-3ubuntu0.1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2021/UBUNTU-CVE-2021-28544.json"}},{"package":{"name":"subversion","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:22.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/subversion@1.14.1-3ubuntu0.22.04.1?arch=source&distro=jammy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.14.1-3ubuntu0.22.04.1"}]}],"versions":["1.14.1-3","1.14.1-3build2","1.14.1-3build3","1.14.1-3build4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"libapache2-mod-svn","binary_version":"1.14.1-3ubuntu0.22.04.1"},{"binary_name":"libsvn-dev","binary_version":"1.14.1-3ubuntu0.22.04.1"},{"binary_name":"libsvn-java","binary_version":"1.14.1-3ubuntu0.22.04.1"},{"binary_name":"libsvn-perl","binary_version":"1.14.1-3ubuntu0.22.04.1"},{"binary_name":"libsvn1","binary_version":"1.14.1-3ubuntu0.22.04.1"},{"binary_name":"python3-subversion","binary_version":"1.14.1-3ubuntu0.22.04.1"},{"binary_name":"ruby-svn","binary_version":"1.14.1-3ubuntu0.22.04.1"},{"binary_name":"subversion","binary_version":"1.14.1-3ubuntu0.22.04.1"},{"binary_name":"subversion-tools","binary_version":"1.14.1-3ubuntu0.22.04.1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2021/UBUNTU-CVE-2021-28544.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-28544"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5372-1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5450-1"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-28544"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
