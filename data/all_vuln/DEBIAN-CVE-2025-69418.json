The subsequent tail-handling code then operates on the original<br>base pointers, effectively reprocessing the beginning of the buffer while<br>leaving the actual trailing bytes unprocessed. The authentication checksum<br>also excludes the true tail bytes.<br><br>However, typical OpenSSL consumers using EVP are not affected because the<br>higher-level EVP and provider OCB implementations split inputs so that full<br>blocks and trailing partial blocks are processed in separate calls, avoiding<br>the problematic code path. Additionally, TLS does not use OCB ciphersuites.<br>The vulnerability only affects applications that call the low-level<br>CRYPTO_ocb128_encrypt() or CRYPTO_ocb128_decrypt() functions directly with<br>non-block-aligned lengths in a single call on hardware-accelerated builds.<br>For these reasons the issue was assessed as Low severity.<br><br>The FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected<br>by this issue, as OCB mode is not a FIPS-approved algorithm.<br><br>OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0 and 1.1.1 are vulnerable to this issue.<br><br>OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not affected by this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"openssl","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.1.1k-1","1.1.1k-1+deb11u1","1.1.1k-1+deb11u2","1.1.1l-1","1.1.1m-0+deb11u1","1.1.1m-1","1.1.1n-0+deb11u1","1.1.1n-0+deb11u2","1.1.1n-0+deb11u3","1.1.1n-0+deb11u4","1.1.1n-0+deb11u5","1.1.1n-0+deb11u6","1.1.1n-1","1.1.1o-1","1.1.1v-0~deb11u1","1.1.1w-0+deb11u1","1.1.1w-0+deb11u2","1.1.1w-0+deb11u3","1.1.1w-0+deb11u4","1.1.1w-0~deb11u1","3.0.0-1","3.0.0~~alpha1-1","3.0.0~~alpha13-1","3.0.0~~alpha13-2","3.0.0~~alpha15-1","3.0.0~~alpha16-1","3.0.0~~alpha3-1","3.0.0~~alpha4-1","3.0.0~~beta1-1","3.0.0~~beta2-1","3.0.1-1","3.0.10-1","3.0.10-1~deb12u1","3.0.11-1","3.0.11-1~deb12u1","3.0.11-1~deb12u2","3.0.12-1","3.0.12-2","3.0.13-1~deb12u1","3.0.13-1~deb12u2","3.0.14-1~deb12u1","3.0.14-1~deb12u2","3.0.15-1~deb12u1","3.0.16-1~deb12u1","3.0.17-1~deb12u1","3.0.17-1~deb12u2","3.0.17-1~deb12u3","3.0.18-1~deb12u1","3.0.18-1~deb12u2","3.0.2-1","3.0.3-1","3.0.3-2","3.0.3-2+ia64","3.0.3-3","3.0.3-4","3.0.3-5","3.0.3-6","3.0.3-7","3.0.3-8","3.0.4-1","3.0.4-2","3.0.5-1","3.0.5-2","3.0.5-3","3.0.5-4","3.0.7-1","3.0.7-2","3.0.8-1","3.0.9-1","3.1.0-1","3.1.1-1","3.1.2-1","3.1.3-1","3.1.4-1","3.1.4-2","3.1.5-1","3.1.5-1.1","3.1.5-1.1+hurd.1","3.2.0-1","3.2.0-2","3.2.1-1","3.2.1-1.1~exp1","3.2.1-2","3.2.1-3","3.2.2-1","3.3.0-1","3.3.0~beta1-1","3.3.1-1","3.3.1-2","3.3.1-5","3.3.1-6","3.3.1-7","3.3.2-1","3.3.2-2","3.4.0-1","3.4.0-2","3.4.0~~beta1-1","3.4.0~~beta1-2","3.4.1-1","3.5.0-1","3.5.0-2","3.5.0-3","3.5.0~~alpha1-1","3.5.0~~beta1-1","3.5.1-1","3.5.2-1","3.5.3-1","3.5.4-1","3.5.4-1~deb13u1","3.5.4-1~deb13u2","3.5.5-1","3.6.0-1","3.6.0-2","3.6.0~~alpha1-1","3.6.0~~beta1-1","3.6.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-69418.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openssl","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.0.18-1~deb12u2"}]}],"versions":["3.0.10-1","3.0.10-1~deb12u1","3.0.11-1","3.0.11-1~deb12u1","3.0.11-1~deb12u2","3.0.12-1","3.0.12-2","3.0.13-1~deb12u1","3.0.13-1~deb12u2","3.0.14-1~deb12u1","3.0.14-1~deb12u2","3.0.15-1~deb12u1","3.0.16-1~deb12u1","3.0.17-1~deb12u1","3.0.17-1~deb12u2","3.0.17-1~deb12u3","3.0.18-1~deb12u1","3.0.9-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-69418.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openssl","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.5.4-1~deb13u2"}]}],"versions":["3.5.1-1","3.5.1-1+deb13u1","3.5.2-1","3.5.3-1","3.5.4-1~deb13u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-69418.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openssl","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.5.1-1","3.5.2-1","3.5.3-1","3.5.4-1","3.5.4-1~deb13u1","3.5.4-1~deb13u2","3.5.5-1","3.6.0-1","3.6.0-2","3.6.0~~alpha1-1","3.6.0~~beta1-1","3.6.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-69418.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-69418"}]}
