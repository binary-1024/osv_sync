In this case, xrstor tries to restore and accesses the unmapped area which results in a fault. But fault_in_readable succeeds because buf + fx_sw->xstate_size is within the still mapped area, so it goes back and tries xrstor again. It will spin in this loop forever.  Instead, fault in the maximum size which can be touched by XRSTOR (taken from fpstate->user_size).
