  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: tls, fix WARNIING in __sk_msg_free\n\nA splice with MSG_SPLICE_PAGES will cause tls code to use the\ntls_sw_sendmsg_splice path in the TLS sendmsg code to move the user\nprovided pages from the msg into the msg_pl. This will loop over the\nmsg until msg_pl is full, checked by sk_msg_full(msg_pl). The user\ncan also set the MORE flag to hint stack to delay sending until receiving\nmore pages and ideally a full buffer.\n\nIf the user adds more pages to the msg than can fit in the msg_pl\nscatterlist (MAX_MSG_FRAGS) we should ignore the MORE flag and send\nthe buffer anyways.\n\nWhat actually happens though is we abort the msg to msg_pl scatterlist\nsetup and then because we forget to set 'full record' indicating we\ncan no longer consume data without a send we fallthrough to the 'continue'\npath which will check if msg_data_left(msg) has more bytes to send and\nthen attempts to fit them in the already full msg_pl. Then next\niteration of sender doing send will encounter a full msg_pl and throw\nthe warning in the syzbot report.\n\nTo fix simply check if we have a full_record in splice code path and\nif not send the msg regardless of MORE flag.",
