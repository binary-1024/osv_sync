  "details": "Grunt is the JavaScript task runner. Why use a task runner? In one word: automation. The less work you have to do when performing repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc, the easier your job becomes. After you&apos;ve configured it, a task runner can do most of that mundane work for you with basically zero effort.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nThe package grunt before 1.3.0 are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution due to the default usage of the function load() instead of its secure replacement safeLoad() of the package js-yaml inside grunt.file.readYAML.(CVE-2020-7729)",
