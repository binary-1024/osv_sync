In Netty before version 4.1.59.Final there is a vulnerability on Unix-like systems involving an insecure temp file. When netty&apos;s multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems. The method &quot;File.createTempFile&quot; on unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions &quot;-rw-r--r--&quot;. Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information. This is the case in netty&apos;s &quot;AbstractDiskHttpData&quot; is vulnerable. This has been fixed in version 4.1.59.Final. As a workaround, one may specify your own &quot;java.io.tmpdir&quot; when you start the JVM or use &quot;DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)&quot; to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.(CVE-2021-21290)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"netty","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/netty&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.1.13-10.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["netty-4.1.13-10.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["netty-help-4.1.13-10.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["netty-4.1.13-10.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["netty-4.1.13-10.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1143.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1143"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21290"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
