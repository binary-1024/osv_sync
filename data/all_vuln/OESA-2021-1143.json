  "details": "Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers &amp; clients.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nNetty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers &amp; clients. In Netty before version 4.1.59.Final there is a vulnerability on Unix-like systems involving an insecure temp file. When netty&apos;s multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems. The method &quot;File.createTempFile&quot; on unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions &quot;-rw-r--r--&quot;. Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information. This is the case in netty&apos;s &quot;AbstractDiskHttpData&quot; is vulnerable. This has been fixed in version 4.1.59.Final. As a workaround, one may specify your own &quot;java.io.tmpdir&quot; when you start the JVM or use &quot;DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)&quot; to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.(CVE-2021-21290)",
