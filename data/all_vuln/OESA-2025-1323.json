This attack could potentially allow an attacker to recover the private key. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 121.(CVE-2023-6135)\n\nOwnership mismanagement led to a use-after-free in ReadableByteStreams This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 120, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.5.0, and Thunderbird &lt; 115.5.(CVE-2023-6207)\n\nWhen using X11, text selected by the page using the Selection API was erroneously copied into the primary selection, a temporary storage not unlike the clipboard.\n*This bug only affects Firefox on X11.

This could contribute to security problems in web sites. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 120, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.5.0, and Thunderbird &lt; 115.5.(CVE-2023-6209)\n\nWhen an https: web page created a pop-up from a &quot;javascript:&quot; URL, that pop-up was incorrectly allowed to load blockable content such as iframes from insecure http: URLs This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 120.(CVE-2023-6210)\n\nIf an attacker needed a user to load an insecure http: page and knew that user had enabled HTTPS-only mode, the attacker could have tricked the user into clicking to grant an HTTPS-only exception if they could get the user to participate in a clicking game. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 120.(CVE-2023-6211)\n\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 119, Firefox ESR 115.4, and Thunderbird 115.4.

This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR &lt; 115.6, Thunderbird &lt; 115.6, and Firefox &lt; 121.(CVE-2023-6861)\n\nA use-after-free was identified in the `nsDNSService::Init`.  This issue appears to manifest rarely during start-up. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR &lt; 115.6 and Thunderbird &lt; 115.6.(CVE-2023-6862)\n\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 120, Firefox ESR 115.5, and Thunderbird 115.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR &lt; 115.6, Thunderbird &lt; 115.6, and Firefox &lt; 121.(CVE-2023-6864)\n\n`EncryptingOutputStream` was susceptible to exposing uninitialized data.  This issue could only be abused in order to write data to a local disk which may have implications for private browsing mode. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR &lt; 115.6 and Firefox &lt; 121.(CVE-2023-6865)\n\nThe timing of a button click causing a popup to disappear was approximately the same length as the anti-clickjacking delay on permission prompts. It was possible to use this fact to surprise users by luring them to click where the permission grant button would be about to appear. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR &lt; 115.6 and Firefox &lt; 121.(CVE-2023-6867)\n\nUnder certain conditions, Firefox did not display a warning when a user attempted to navigate to a new protocol handler. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 121.(CVE-2023-6871)\n\nBrowser tab titles were being leaked by GNOME to system logs. This could potentially expose the browsing habits of users running in a private tab. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 121.(CVE-2023-6872)\n\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 120. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 121.(CVE-2023-6873)\n\nAn out of bounds write in ANGLE could have allowed an attacker to corrupt memory leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 122, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.7, and Thunderbird &lt; 115.7.(CVE-2024-0741)\n\nIt was possible for certain browser prompts and dialogs to be activated or dismissed unintentionally by the user due to an incorrect timestamp used to prevent input after page load. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 122, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.7, and Thunderbird &lt; 115.7.(CVE-2024-0742)\n\nIn some circumstances, JIT compiled code could have dereferenced a wild pointer value. This could have led to an exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 122.(CVE-2024-0744)\n\nWhen a parent page loaded a child in an iframe with `unsafe-inline`, the parent Content Security Policy could have overridden the child Content Security Policy. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 122, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.7, and Thunderbird &lt; 115.7.(CVE-2024-0747)\n\nA phishing site could have repurposed an `about:` dialog to show phishing content with an incorrect origin in the address bar. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 122 and Thunderbird &lt; 115.7.(CVE-2024-0749)\n\nA malicious devtools extension could have been used to escalate privileges. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 122, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.7, and Thunderbird &lt; 115.7.(CVE-2024-0751)\n\nIn specific HSTS configurations an attacker could have bypassed HSTS on a subdomain. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 122, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.7, and Thunderbird &lt; 115.7.(CVE-2024-0753)\n\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 121, Firefox ESR 115.6, and Thunderbird 115.6.

Other operating systems are unaffected. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 127, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.12, and Thunderbird &lt; 115.12.(CVE-2024-5692)\n\nAn attacker could have caused a use-after-free in the JavaScript engine to read memory in the JavaScript string section of the heap. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 127.(CVE-2024-5694)\n\nIf an out-of-memory condition occurs at a specific point using allocations in the probabilistic heap checker, an assertion could have been triggered, and in rarer situations, memory corruption could have occurred. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 127.(CVE-2024-5695)\n\nBy manipulating the fullscreen feature while opening a data-list, an attacker could have overlaid a text box over the address bar. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 127.(CVE-2024-5698)\n\nIn violation of spec, cookie prefixes such as `__Secure` were being ignored if they were not correctly capitalized - by spec they should be checked with a case-insensitive comparison. This could have resulted in the browser not correctly honoring the behaviors specified by the prefix. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 127.(CVE-2024-5699)\n\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 126, Firefox ESR 115.11, and Thunderbird 115.11.
