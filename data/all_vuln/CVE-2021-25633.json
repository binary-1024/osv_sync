An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice allowed an attacker to create a digitally signed ODF document, by manipulating the documentsignatures.xml or macrosignatures.xml stream within the document to combine multiple certificate data, which when opened caused LibreOffice to display a validly signed indicator but whose content was unrelated to the signature shown. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7-0 versions prior to 7.0.6; 7-1 versions prior to 7.1.2.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4988"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/security/advisories/CVE-2021-25633"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
