Prior to versions 20.15.2, 21.10.2, and 22.5.2, if a SIP request is received with an Authorization header that contains a realm that wasn't in a previous 401 response's WWW-Authenticate header, or an Authorization header with an incorrect realm was received without a previous 401 response being sent, the get_authorization_header() function in res_pjsip_authenticator_digest will return a NULL. This wasn't being checked before attempting to get the digest algorithm from the header which causes a SEGV. This issue has been patched in versions 20.15.2, 21.10.2, and 22.5.2. There are no workarounds.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"asterisk","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/asterisk?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:16.16.1~dfsg+~2.10-1","1:16.16.1~dfsg+~2.10-2","1:16.16.1~dfsg-1","1:16.16.1~dfsg-1+deb11u1","1:16.16.1~dfsg-1+deb11u1~bpo10+1","1:16.16.1~dfsg-2","1:16.16.1~dfsg-3","1:16.16.1~dfsg-4","1:16.23.0~dfsg+~2.10-1","1:16.23.0~dfsg+~cs6.10.20220309-1","1:16.23.0~dfsg+~cs6.10.20220309-2","1:16.23.0~dfsg+~cs6.10.40431411-1","1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb11u1","1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb11u2","1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb11u3","1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb11u4","1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb11u5","1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb11u6","1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb11u7","1:18.10.0~dfsg+~cs6.10.40431411-1","1:18.10.0~dfsg+~cs6.10.40431411-2","1:18.10.1~dfsg+~cs6.10.40431411-1","1:18.11.1~dfsg+~cs6.10.40431413-1","1:18.11.2~dfsg+~cs6.10.40431413-1","1:18.12.0~dfsg+~cs6.12.40431413-1","1:18.14.0~dfsg+~cs6.12.40431414-1","1:18.14.0~~rc1~dfsg+~cs6.12.40431414-1","1:18.9.0~dfsg+~cs6.10.40431411-1","1:20.0.0~dfsg+~cs6.12.40431414-1","1:20.0.0~dfsg+~cs6.12.40431414-2","1:20.0.0~~rc1~dfsg+~cs6.12.40431414-1","1:20.0.0~~rc2~dfsg+~cs6.12.40431414-1","1:20.0.1~dfsg+~cs6.12.40431414-1","1:20.1.0~dfsg+~cs6.12.40431414-1","1:20.1.0~~rc2~dfsg+~cs6.12.40431414-1","1:20.2.1~dfsg+~cs6.13.40431413-1","1:20.3.0~dfsg+~cs6.13.40431413-1","1:20.4.0~dfsg+~cs6.13.40431414-1","1:20.4.0~dfsg+~cs6.13.40431414-2","1:20.5.0~dfsg+~cs6.13.40431414-1","1:20.5.1~dfsg+~cs6.13.40431414-1","1:20.5.2~dfsg+~cs6.13.40431414-1","1:20.6.0~dfsg+~cs6.13.40431414-1","1:20.6.0~dfsg+~cs6.13.40431414-2","1:20.8.1~dfsg+~cs6.14.40431414-1","1:20.9.3~dfsg+~cs6.14.60671435-1","1:22.0.0~dfsg+~cs6.14.60671435-1","1:22.0.0~~rc2~dfsg+~cs6.14.60671435-1","1:22.1.0~dfsg+~cs6.14.60671435-1","1:22.1.1~dfsg+~cs6.14.60671435-1","1:22.2.0~dfsg+~cs6.15.60671435-1","1:22.2.0~dfsg+~cs6.15.60671435-2","1:22.3.0~dfsg+~cs6.15.60671435-1","1:22.3.0~~rc1~dfsg+~cs6.15.60671435-1","1:22.4.1~dfsg+~cs6.15.60671435-1","1:22.4.1~dfsg+~cs6.15.60671435-2","1:22.5.1~dfsg+~cs6.15.60671435-1","1:22.5.2~dfsg+~cs6.15.60671435-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-57767.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-57767"}]}
