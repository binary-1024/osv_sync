  "details": "Updated java-1.8.0-openjdk packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nMultiple flaws were discovered in the Serialization and Hotspot components in\nOpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to\ncompletely bypass Java sandbox restrictions (CVE-2016-0686, CVE-2016-0687).\n\nIt was discovered that the RMI server implementation in the JMX component in\nOpenJDK did not restrict which classes can be deserialized when deserializing\nauthentication credentials. A remote, unauthenticated attacker able to connect\nto a JMX port could possibly use this flaw to trigger deserialization flaws\n(CVE-2016-3427).\n\nIt was discovered that the JAXP component in OpenJDK failed to properly handle\nUnicode surrogate pairs used as part of the XML attribute values. Specially\ncrafted XML input could cause a Java application to use an excessive amount of\nmemory when parsed (CVE-2016-3425).\n\nIt was discovered that the GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) implementation in the JCE\ncomponent in OpenJDK used a non-constant time comparison when comparing GCM\nauthentication tags. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to\ndetermine the value of the authentication tag (CVE-2016-3426).\n\nIt was discovered that the Security component in OpenJDK failed to check the\ndigest algorithm strength when generating DSA signatures. The use of a digest\nweaker than the key strength could lead to the generation of signatures that\nwere weaker than expected (CVE-2016-0695).\n",
