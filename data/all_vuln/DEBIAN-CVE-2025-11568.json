An attacker with the necessary permissions can exploit this flaw by writing a large amount of metadata to an encrypted device. The utility fails to correctly validate the available space, causing the metadata to overwrite and corrupt the user's encrypted data. This action leads to a permanent loss of the stored information. Devices using the LUKS formats other than LUKS1 are not affected by this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"luksmeta","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/luksmeta?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["10-1","9-3","9-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-11568.json"}},{"package":{"name":"luksmeta","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/luksmeta?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["10-1","9-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-11568.json"}},{"package":{"name":"luksmeta","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/luksmeta?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["10-1","9-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-11568.json"}},{"package":{"name":"luksmeta","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/luksmeta?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"10-1"}]}],"versions":["9-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-11568.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-11568"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
