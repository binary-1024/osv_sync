{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-c5qx-p38x-qf5w","published":"2025-07-21T19:19:03Z","modified":"2025-07-21T19:19:03Z","summary":"RageAgainstThePixel/setup-steamcmd leaked authentication token in job output logs","details":"### Summary\nLog output includes authentication token that provides full account access\n\n### Details\nThe post job action prints the contents of `config/config.vdf` which holds the saved authentication token and can be used to sign in on another machine. This means any public use of this action leaves authentication tokes for the associated steam accounts publicly available. Additionally, `userdata/$user_id$/config/localconfig.vdf` contains potentially sensitive information which should not be included in public logs.\n\n### PoC\nUse the following workflow step\n```\nsteps:\n      - name: Setup SteamCMD\n        uses: buildalon/setup-steamcmd@v1.0.4\n\n      - name: Sign into steam\n        shell: bash\n        run: |\n          steamcmd +login ${{ secrets.WORKSHOP_USERNAME }} ${{ secrets.WORKSHOP_PASSWORD }} +quit\n```\n\n### Impact\nAnyone who has used this workflow action with a steam account is affected and has had valid authentication tokens leaked in the job logs. This is particularly bad for public repositories, as anyone with a GitHub account can access the logs and view the token.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"RageAgainstThePixel/setup-steamcmd","ecosystem":"GitHub Actions"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.3.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/07/GHSA-c5qx-p38x-qf5w/GHSA-c5qx-p38x-qf5w.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RageAgainstThePixel/setup-steamcmd/security/advisories/GHSA-c5qx-p38x-qf5w"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RageAgainstThePixel/setup-steamcmd/commit/3e4e408e73bdd46822f1147b45eeeab050fd1ead"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/RageAgainstThePixel/setup-steamcmd"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-532"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-07-21T19:19:03Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
