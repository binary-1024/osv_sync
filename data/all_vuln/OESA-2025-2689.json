The constructor for the StringLookup layer accepts a vocabulary argument that can specify a local file path or a remote file path.\n\n  *  Arbitrary Local File Read: An attacker can create a malicious .keras file that embeds a local path in the StringLookup layer&apos;s configuration. When the model is loaded, Keras will attempt to read the content of the specified local file and incorporate it into the model state (e.g., retrievable via get_vocabulary()), allowing an attacker to read arbitrary local files on the hosting system.\n\n\n  *  Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): Keras utilizes tf.io.gfile for file operations. Since tf.io.gfile supports remote filesystem handlers (such as GCS and HDFS) and HTTP/HTTPS protocols, the same mechanism can be leveraged to fetch content from arbitrary network endpoints on the server&apos;s behalf, resulting in an SSRF condition.\n\n\nThe security issue is that the feature allowing external path loading was not properly restricted by the safe_mode=True flag, which was intended to prevent such unintended data access.(CVE-2025-12058)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-Keras","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python-Keras&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.12.0-2.oe2403sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"noarch":["python-Keras-help-2.12.0-2.oe2403sp1.noarch.rpm","python3-Keras-2.12.0-2.oe2403sp1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["python-Keras-2.12.0-2.oe2403sp1.src.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2689.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2689"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12058"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
