Make DFS root sessions have same lifetime as DFS tcons so we can avoid the use-after-free bug is DFS cache refresher and other places that require IPCs to get new DFS referrals on.  Also, get rid of mount group handling in DFS cache as we no longer need it.  This fixes below use-after-free bug catched by KASAN  [ 379.946955] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in __refresh_tcon.isra.0+0x10b/0xc10 [cifs] [ 379.947642] Read of size 8 at addr ffff888018f57030 by task kworker/u4:3/56 [ 379.948096] [ 379.948208] CPU: 0 PID: 56 Comm: kworker/u4:3 Not tainted 6.2.0-rc7-lku #23 [ 379.948661] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552-rebuilt.opensuse.org 04/01/2014 [ 379.949368] Workqueue: cifs-dfscache refresh_cache_worker [cifs] [ 379.949942] Call Trace: [ 379.950113] <TASK> [ 379.950260] dump_stack_lvl+0x50/0x67 [ 379.950510] print_report+0x16a/0x48e [ 379.950759] ? __virt_addr_valid+0xd8/0x160 [ 379.951040] ? __phys_addr+0x41/0x80 [ 379.951285] kasan_report+0xdb/0x110 [ 379.951533] ? __refresh_tcon.isra.0+0x10b/0xc10 [cifs] [ 379.952056] ? __refresh_tcon.isra.0+0x10b/0xc10 [cifs] [ 379.952585] __refresh_tcon.isra.0+0x10b/0xc10 [cifs] [ 379.953096] ? __pfx___refresh_tcon.isra.0+0x10/0x10 [cifs] [ 379.953637] ? __pfx___mutex_lock+0x10/0x10 [ 379.953915] ? lock_release+0xb6/0x720 [ 379.954167] ? __pfx_lock_acquire+0x10/0x10 [ 379.954443] ? refresh_cache_worker+0x34e/0x6d0 [cifs] [ 379.954960] ? __pfx_wb_workfn+0x10/0x10 [ 379.955239] refresh_cache_worker+0x4ad/0x6d0 [cifs] [ 379.955755] ? __pfx_refresh_cache_worker+0x10/0x10 [cifs] [ 379.956323] ? __pfx_lock_acquired+0x10/0x10 [ 379.956615] ? read_word_at_a_time+0xe/0x20 [ 379.956898] ? lockdep_hardirqs_on_prepare+0x12/0x220 [ 379.957235] process_one_work+0x535/0x990 [ 379.957509] ? __pfx_process_one_work+0x10/0x10 [ 379.957812] ? lock_acquired+0xb7/0x5f0 [ 379.958069] ? __list_add_valid+0x37/0xd0 [ 379.958341] ? __list_add_valid+0x37/0xd0 [ 379.958611] worker_thread+0x8e/0x630 [ 379.958861] ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10 [ 379.959148] kthread+0x17d/0x1b0 [ 379.959369] ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10 [ 379.959630] ret_from_fork+0x2c/0x50 [ 379.959879] </TASK>","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.3.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53052.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.3.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53052.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-53052"}]}
