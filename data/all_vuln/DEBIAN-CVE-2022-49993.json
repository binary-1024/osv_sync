This proceeds to call loop_configure() which in turn calls loop_set_status_from_info() (see line 1050 of loop.c), passing &config->info which is of type loop_info64*. This function then sets the appropriate values, like the offset.  loop_device has lo_offset of type loff_t (see line 52 of loop.c), which is typdef-chained to long long, whereas loop_info64 has lo_offset of type __u64 (see line 56 of include/uapi/linux/loop.h).  The function directly copies offset from info to the device as follows (See line 980 of loop.c): \tlo->lo_offset = info->lo_offset;  This results in an overflow, which triggers a warning in iomap_iter() due to a call to iomap_iter_done() which has: \tWARN_ON_ONCE(iter->iomap.offset > iter->pos);  Thus, check for negative value during loop_set_status_from_info().
