  "details": "libcurl uses the given file part of a TFTP URL in a manner that allows a\nmalicious user to overflow a heap-based memory buffer due to the lack of\nboundary check.\n\nThis overflow happens if you pass in a URL with a TFTP protocol prefix\n(\"tftp://\"), using a valid host and a path part that is longer than 512 bytes.\n\nThe affected flaw can be triggered by a redirect, if curl/libcurl is told to\nfollow redirects and an HTTP server points the client to a tftp URL with the\ncharacteristics described above.",
