  "details": "An attacker who compromised a content process could have partially escaped\nthe sandbox to read arbitrary files via clipboard-related IPC messages\n(CVE-2022-46872).\n\nA drag-and-dropped file with a long filename could have had its filename\ntruncated to remove the valid extension, leaving a malicious extension in\nits place. This could potentially led to user confusion and the execution\nof malicious code (CVE-2022-46874).\n\nMozilla developers Randell Jesup, Valentin Gosu, Olli Pettay, and the\nMozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox ESR\n102.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we\npresume that with  enough effort some of these could have been exploited\nto run arbitrary code (CVE-2022-46878).\n\nA missing check related to tex units could have led to a use-after-free in\nWebGL and potentially exploitable crash (CVE-2022-46880).\n\nAn optimization in WebGL was incorrect in some cases, and could have led\nto memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash (CVE-2022-46881).\n\nA use-after-free in WebGL extensions could have led to a potentially\nexploitable crash (CVE-2022-46882).\n",
