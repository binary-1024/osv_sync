In Nim release versions before versions 1.2.10 and 1.4.4, \"nimble refresh\" fetches a list of Nimble packages over HTTPS by default. In case of error it falls back to a non-TLS URL http://irclogs.nim-lang.org/packages.json. An attacker able to perform MitM can deliver a modified package list containing malicious software packages. If the packages are installed and used the attack escalates to untrusted code execution.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nim","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.6+really1.4.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-21373.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nim","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.6+really1.4.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-21373.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nim","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.6+really1.4.2-1"}]}],"versions":["0.11.2+dfsg1-1","0.11.2+dfsg1-2","0.11.2+dfsg1-3","0.11.2+dfsg1-4","0.12.0-1","0.12.0-2","0.13.0-1","0.14.2-1","0.15.0-1","0.15.0-2","0.15.0-3","0.15.2-1","0.15.2-2","0.16.0-1","0.17.0-1","0.17.0-2","0.17.0-2~bpo9+1","0.17.2-1","0.18.0-1","0.18.0-2","0.19.0-1","0.19.2-1","0.19.2-2","0.19.4-1","0.19.6-1","0.19.6-2","0.20.0-1","0.20.0-2","0.20.2-1","1.0.0-1","1.0.0-1~bpo10+1","1.0.2-1","1.0.2-1~bpo10+1","1.0.2~a-1","1.0.2~b-1","1.0.2~rc-1","1.0.3~rc-1","1.0.4-1","1.0.4-1~bpo10+1","1.0.5~rc-1","1.0.6-1","1.2.0-1","1.2.0~rc-1","1.2.0~rc2-1","1.2.0~rc3-1","1.2.1~rc1-1","1.2.1~rc2-1","1.2.2-1","1.2.4-1","1.2.6-1","1.2.6~rc1-1","1.4.0-1","1.4.2-1","1.4.6-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-21373.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-21373"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
