A crash was observed in `EnvoyQuicServerStream::OnInitialHeadersComplete()` with following call stack. It is a use-after-free caused by QUICHE continuing push request headers after `StopReading()` being called on the stream. As after `StopReading()`, the HCM's `ActiveStream` might have already be destroyed and any up calls from QUICHE could potentially cause use after free.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"envoy","ecosystem":"Bitnami","purl":"pkg:bitnami/envoy"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.27.6"},{"introduced":"1.28.0"},{"fixed":"1.28.4"},{"introduced":"1.29.0"},{"fixed":"1.29.5"},{"introduced":"1.30.0"},{"fixed":"1.30.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/bitnami/vulndb/tree/main/data/envoy/BIT-envoy-2024-32974.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-mgxp-7hhp-8299"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32974"}],"database_specific":{"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"severity":"High"}}
