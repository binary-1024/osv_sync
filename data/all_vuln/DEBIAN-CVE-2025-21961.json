{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-21961","published":"2025-04-01T16:15:27Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:20:17.534375Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-21961"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  eth: bnxt: fix truesize for mb-xdp-pass case  When mb-xdp is set and return is XDP_PASS, packet is converted from xdp_buff to sk_buff with xdp_update_skb_shared_info() in bnxt_xdp_build_skb(). bnxt_xdp_build_skb() passes incorrect truesize argument to xdp_update_skb_shared_info(). The truesize is calculated as BNXT_RX_PAGE_SIZE * sinfo->nr_frags but the skb_shared_info was wiped by napi_build_skb() before. So it stores sinfo->nr_frags before bnxt_xdp_build_skb() and use it instead of getting skb_shared_info from xdp_get_shared_info_from_buff().
