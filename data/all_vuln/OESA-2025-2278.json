In such a case, a client trusted to access one virtual host may be able to access another virtual host, if SSLStrictSNIVHostCheck is not enabled in either virtual host.(CVE-2025-23048)\n\nIn some mod_ssl configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions through to 2.4.63, an HTTP desynchronisation attack allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to hijack an HTTP session via a TLS upgrade.\n\nOnly configurations using &quot;SSLEngine optional&quot; to enable TLS upgrades are affected. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.64, which removes support for TLS upgrade.(CVE-2025-49812)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"httpd","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/httpd&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.58-10.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["httpd-2.4.58-10.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","httpd-debuginfo-2.4.58-10.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","httpd-debugsource-2.4.58-10.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","httpd-devel-2.4.58-10.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","httpd-tools-2.4.58-10.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","mod_ldap-2.4.58-10.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","mod_md-2.4.58-10.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","mod_proxy_html-2.4.58-10.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","mod_session-2.4.58-10.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","mod_ssl-2.4.58-10.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["httpd-filesystem-2.4.58-10.oe2403.noarch.rpm","httpd-help-2.4.58-10.oe2403.noarch.rpm"],"src":["httpd-2.4.58-10.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["httpd-2.4.58-10.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","httpd-debuginfo-2.4.58-10.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","httpd-debugsource-2.4.58-10.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","httpd-devel-2.4.58-10.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","httpd-tools-2.4.58-10.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","mod_ldap-2.4.58-10.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","mod_md-2.4.58-10.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","mod_proxy_html-2.4.58-10.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","mod_session-2.4.58-10.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","mod_ssl-2.4.58-10.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2278.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2278"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42516"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43204"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47252"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23048"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49812"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Critical"}}
