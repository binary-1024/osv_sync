  "details": "### Impact\n\nThe Snowboard framework in affected versions is vulnerable to prototype pollution in the main Snowboard class as well as its plugin loader. \n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in https://github.com/wintercms/winter/commit/2a13faf99972e84c9661258f16c4750fa99d29a1 (for 1.2) and https://github.com/wintercms/winter/commit/bce4b59584abf961e9400af3d7a4fd7638e26c7f (for 1.1) and is available with Winter v1.1.10 and v1.2.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you have not yet upgraded, or are using the 1.1 branch of Winter (1.1.8 or above), you can avoid this issue by following some common security practices for JavaScript, including implementing a [content security policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) and auditing your scripts.\n\nThe 1.0 branch of Winter is not affected, as it does not contain the Snowboard framework.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Email us at [hello@wintercms.com](mailto:hello@wintercms.com)\n",
