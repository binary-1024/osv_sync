When a node has been copied from a protected location, users with access to the copy can see the copyfrom path of the original. This also reveals the fact that the node was copied. Only the copyfrom path is revealed; not its contents. Both httpd and svnserve servers are vulnerable.(CVE-2021-28544)\n\nSubversion s mod_dav_svn is vulnerable to memory corruption. While looking up path-based authorization rules, mod_dav_svn servers may attempt to use memory which has already been freed. Affected Subversion mod_dav_svn servers 1.10.0 through 1.14.1 (inclusive). Servers that do not use mod_dav_svn are not affected.(CVE-2022-24070)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"subversion","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/subversion&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.12.2-4.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["perl-subversion-1.12.2-4.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-subversion-1.12.2-4.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ruby-subversion-1.12.2-4.oe1.aarch64.rpm","subversion-1.12.2-4.oe1.aarch64.rpm","subversion-debuginfo-1.12.2-4.oe1.aarch64.rpm","subversion-debugsource-1.12.2-4.oe1.aarch64.rpm","subversion-devel-1.12.2-4.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["subversion-help-1.12.2-4.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["subversion-1.12.2-4.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["perl-subversion-1.12.2-4.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-subversion-1.12.2-4.oe1.x86_64.rpm","ruby-subversion-1.12.2-4.oe1.x86_64.rpm","subversion-1.12.2-4.oe1.x86_64.rpm","subversion-debuginfo-1.12.2-4.oe1.x86_64.rpm","subversion-debugsource-1.12.2-4.oe1.x86_64.rpm","subversion-devel-1.12.2-4.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1647.json"}},{"package":{"name":"subversion","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/subversion&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.12.2-4.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["perl-subversion-1.12.2-4.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-subversion-1.12.2-4.oe1.aarch64.rpm","ruby-subversion-1.12.2-4.oe1.aarch64.rpm","subversion-1.12.2-4.oe1.aarch64.rpm","subversion-debuginfo-1.12.2-4.oe1.aarch64.rpm","subversion-debugsource-1.12.2-4.oe1.aarch64.rpm","subversion-devel-1.12.2-4.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["subversion-help-1.12.2-4.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["subversion-1.12.2-4.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["perl-subversion-1.12.2-4.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-subversion-1.12.2-4.oe1.x86_64.rpm","ruby-subversion-1.12.2-4.oe1.x86_64.rpm","subversion-1.12.2-4.oe1.x86_64.rpm","subversion-debuginfo-1.12.2-4.oe1.x86_64.rpm","subversion-debugsource-1.12.2-4.oe1.x86_64.rpm","subversion-devel-1.12.2-4.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1647.json"}},{"package":{"name":"subversion","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/subversion&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.14.1-2.oe2203"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["perl-subversion-1.14.1-2.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","python3-subversion-1.14.1-2.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","ruby-subversion-1.14.1-2.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","subversion-1.14.1-2.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","subversion-debuginfo-1.14.1-2.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","subversion-debugsource-1.14.1-2.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","subversion-devel-1.14.1-2.oe2203.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["subversion-help-1.14.1-2.oe2203.noarch.rpm"],"src":["subversion-1.14.1-2.oe2203.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["perl-subversion-1.14.1-2.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","python3-subversion-1.14.1-2.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","ruby-subversion-1.14.1-2.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","subversion-1.14.1-2.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","subversion-debuginfo-1.14.1-2.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","subversion-debugsource-1.14.1-2.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","subversion-devel-1.14.1-2.oe2203.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1647.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2022-1647"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28544"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24070"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
