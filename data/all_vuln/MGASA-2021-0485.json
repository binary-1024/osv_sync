  "details": "A vulnerability in the JNDI Realm of Apache Tomcat allows an attacker to\nauthenticate using variations of a valid user name and/or to bypass some\nof the protection provided by the LockOut Realm. (CVE-2021-30640)\n\nApache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.6, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.46 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.66\ndid not correctly parse the HTTP transfer-encoding request header in some\ncircumstances leading to the possibility to request smuggling when used\nwith a reverse proxy. Specifically: - Tomcat incorrectly ignored the\ntransfer encoding header if the client declared it would only accept an\nHTTP/1.0 response; - Tomcat honoured the identify encoding; and - Tomcat\ndid not ensure that, if present, the chunked encoding was the final\nencoding. (CVE-2021-33037)\n\nApache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.63, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.43 and 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.2\ndid not properly validate incoming TLS packets. When Tomcat was configured\nto use NIO+OpenSSL or NIO2+OpenSSL for TLS, a specially crafted packet\ncould be used to trigger an infinite loop resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2021-41079)\n\nThe fix for bug 63362 present in Apache Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.0-M5,\n10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.11, 9.0.40 to 9.0.53 and 8.5.60 to 8.5.71 introduced a\nmemory leak. The object introduced to collect metrics for HTTP upgrade\nconnections was not released for WebSocket connections once the\nconnection was closed. This created a memory leak that, over time, could\nlead to a denial of service via an OutOfMemoryError. (CVE-2021-42340)\n",
