{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-23986","published":"2026-01-21T22:20:37.720Z","modified":"2026-01-28T05:53:07.919067Z","aliases":["GHSA-4fqp-r85r-hxqh"],"summary":"Copier safe template has arbitrary filesystem write access via directory symlinks when _preserve_symlinks: true","details":"Copier is a library and CLI app for rendering project templates. Prior to version 9.11.2, Copier suggests that it's safe to generate a project from a safe template, i.e. one that doesn't use unsafe features like custom Jinja extensions which would require passing the `--UNSAFE,--trust` flag. As it turns out, a safe template can currently write to arbitrary directories outside the destination path by using directory a symlink along with `_preserve_symlinks: true` and a generated directory structure whose rendered path is inside the symlinked directory. This way, a malicious template author can create a template that overwrites arbitrary files (according to the user's write permissions), e.g., to cause havoc. Version 9.11.2 patches the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/copier-org/copier","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b9ee2962b5e0a81b838261b630bd36d0c6c3fa87"}]}],"versions":["1.1.1","3.0.0-alpha5","3.0.0-alpha6","v2.2.3","v2.3","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.3.3","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.2","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v3.0.0","v3.0.0-alpha1","v3.0.0-alpha2","v3.0.0-alpha3","v3.0.0-alpha4","v3.0.0-alpha7","v3.0.0-alpha8","v3.0.0-beta1","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.5","v3.0.6","v3.1.0","v3.2.0","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.1.0","v5.0.0","v5.1.0","v6.0.0","v6.0.0a0","v6.0.0a1","v6.0.0a2","v6.0.0a3","v6.0.0a4","v6.0.0a5","v6.0.0a6","v6.0.0a7","v6.0.0a8","v6.0.0a9","v6.0.0b0","v6.1.0","v6.2.0","v7.0.1","v7.1.0","v7.1.0a0","v7.2.0","v8.0.0","v8.1.0","v8.2.0","v8.3.0","v9.0.0","v9.0.1","v9.1.0","v9.1.1","v9.10.0","v9.10.1","v9.10.2","v9.10.3","v9.11.0","v9.11.1","v9.2.0","v9.3.0","v9.3.1","v9.4.0","v9.4.1","v9.5.0","v9.6.0","v9.7.0","v9.7.1","v9.8.0","v9.9.0","v9.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23986.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23986.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/copier-org/copier/commit/b3a7b3772d17cf0e7a4481978188c9f536c8d8f6"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/copier-org/copier/releases/tag/v9.11.2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/copier-org/copier/security/advisories/GHSA-4fqp-r85r-hxqh"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23986"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-61"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23986.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
