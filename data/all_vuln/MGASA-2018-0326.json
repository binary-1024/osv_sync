  "details": "A NULL pointer dereference was discovered in sync_buffer in interface.c\nin mpglibDBL, as used in MP3Gain version 1.5.2. The vulnerability causes\na segmentation fault and application crash, which leads to remote denial\nof service (CVE-2017-14406).\n\nA stack-based buffer over-read was discovered in filterYule in\ngain_analysis.c in MP3Gain version 1.5.2. The vulnerability causes an\napplication crash, which leads to remote denial of service (CVE-2017-14407).\n\nA stack-based buffer over-read was discovered in dct36 in layer3.c in\nmpglibDBL, as used in MP3Gain version 1.5.2. The vulnerability causes an\napplication crash, which leads to remote denial of service (CVE-2017-14408).\n\nA buffer overflow was discovered in III_dequantize_sample in layer3.c in\nmpglibDBL, as used in MP3Gain version 1.5.2. The vulnerability causes an\nout-of-bounds write, which leads to remote denial of service or possibly\ncode execution (CVE-2017-14409).\n\nA buffer over-read was discovered in III_i_stereo in layer3.c in mpglibDBL,\nas used in MP3Gain version 1.5.2. The vulnerability causes an application\ncrash, which leads to remote denial of service (CVE-2017-14410).\n\nA stack-based buffer overflow was discovered in copy_mp in interface.c in\nmpglibDBL, as used in MP3Gain version 1.5.2. The vulnerability causes an\nout-of-bounds write, which leads to remote denial of service or possibly\ncode execution (CVE-2017-14411).\n\nAn invalid memory write was discovered in copy_mp in interface.c in\nmpglibDBL, as used in MP3Gain version 1.5.2. The vulnerability causes a\ndenial of service (segmentation fault and application crash) or possibly\nunspecified other impact (CVE-2017-14412).\n\nBuffer overflow in the WriteMP3GainAPETag function in apetag.c in mp3gain\nthrough 1.5.2-r2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n(application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact\n(CVE-2018-10777).\n",
