  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: pci: tw68: Fix null-ptr-deref bug in buf prepare and finish\n\nWhen the driver calls tw68_risc_buffer() to prepare the buffer, the\nfunction call dma_alloc_coherent may fail, resulting in a empty buffer\nbuf->cpu. Later when we free the buffer or access the buffer, null ptr\nderef is triggered.\n\nThis bug is similar to the following one:\nhttps://git.linuxtv.org/media_stage.git/commit/?id=2b064d91440b33fba5b452f2d1b31f13ae911d71.\n\nWe believe the bug can be also dynamically triggered from user side.\nSimilarly, we fix this by checking the return value of tw68_risc_buffer()\nand the value of buf->cpu before buffer free.",
