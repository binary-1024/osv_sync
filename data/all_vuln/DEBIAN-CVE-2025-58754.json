{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-58754","published":"2025-09-12T02:15:46Z","modified":"2025-10-14T04:26:09.867737Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-58754"],"details":"Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. When Axios prior to versions 0.30.2 and 1.12.0 runs on Node.js and is given a URL with the `data:` scheme, it does not perform HTTP. Instead, its Node http adapter decodes the entire payload into memory (`Buffer`/`Blob`) and returns a synthetic 200 response. This path ignores `maxContentLength` / `maxBodyLength` (which only protect HTTP responses), so an attacker can supply a very large `data:` URI and cause the process to allocate unbounded memory and crash (DoS), even if the caller requested `responseType: 'stream'`. Versions 0.30.2 and 1.12.0 contain a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"node-axios","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-axios?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.21.1+dfsg-1","0.21.1+dfsg-1+deb11u1","0.21.3+dfsg-1","0.21.4+dfsg-1","0.22.0+dfsg-1","0.23.0+dfsg-1","0.23.0+dfsg-2","0.24.0+dfsg-1","0.25.0+dfsg-1","0.25.0+dfsg-2","0.26.0+dfsg-1","0.26.1+dfsg-1","0.26.1+dfsg-2","0.27.2+dfsg-1","0.27.2+dfsg-2","1.1.2+dfsg-1","1.1.2+dfsg-2","1.1.2+dfsg-3","1.1.3+dfsg-1","1.1.3+dfsg-2","1.11.0+dfsg-1","1.12.1+dfsg-1","1.2.0+dfsg-1","1.2.1+dfsg-1","1.5.1+dfsg-1","1.6.2+dfsg-1","1.6.8+dfsg-1","1.6.8+dfsg-2","1.7.3+dfsg-1","1.7.4+dfsg-1","1.7.7+dfsg-1","1.7.9+dfsg-1","1.8.4+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-58754.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-axios","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-axios?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.11.0+dfsg-1","1.12.1+dfsg-1","1.2.1+dfsg-1","1.2.1+dfsg-1+deb12u1","1.5.1+dfsg-1","1.6.2+dfsg-1","1.6.8+dfsg-1","1.6.8+dfsg-2","1.7.3+dfsg-1","1.7.4+dfsg-1","1.7.7+dfsg-1","1.7.9+dfsg-1","1.8.4+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-58754.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-axios","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-axios?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.11.0+dfsg-1","1.12.1+dfsg-1","1.8.4+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-58754.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-axios","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-axios?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.12.1+dfsg-1"}]}],"versions":["1.11.0+dfsg-1","1.8.4+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-58754.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-58754"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
