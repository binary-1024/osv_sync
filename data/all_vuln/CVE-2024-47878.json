Prior to version 3.8.3, the `/extension/gdata/authorized` endpoint includes the `state` GET parameter verbatim in a `<script>` tag in the output, so without escaping. An attacker could lead or redirect a user to a crafted URL containing JavaScript code, which would then cause that code to be executed in the victim's browser as if it was part of OpenRefine. Version 3.8.3 fixes this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openrefine/openrefine","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"10bf0874d67f1018a58b3732332d76b840192fea"}]}],"versions":["1.1","2.6-alpha.2","2.6-alpha1","2.6-beta.1","2.6-rc.2","2.7","2.7-rc.1","2.7-rc.2","2.8","3.0","3.0-beta","3.0-rc.1","3.1","3.1-beta","3.2","3.2-beta","3.3","3.3-beta","3.3-rc1","3.4-beta","3.5-beta1","3.7-beta2","3.8-beta1","v2.6-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-47878.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/commit/10bf0874d67f1018a58b3732332d76b840192fea"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/security/advisories/GHSA-pw3x-c5vp-mfc3"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
