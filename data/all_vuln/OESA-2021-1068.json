It is unique in that it combines the speed and XML feature completeness of these libraries with the simplicity of a native Python API, mostly compatible but superior to the well-known ElementTree API. The latest release works with all CPython versions from 2.7 to 3.7.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA XSS vulnerability was discovered in python-lxml's clean module. The module's parser didn't properly imitate browsers, which caused different behaviors between the sanitizer and the user's page.
