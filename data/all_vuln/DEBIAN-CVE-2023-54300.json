For example, the obtained SKB may have been badly constructed with pkt_len = 8. In this case, the SKB can only contain a valid htc_frame_hdr but after being processed in ath9k_htc_rx_msg() and passed to ath9k_wmi_ctrl_rx() endpoint RX handler, it is expected to have a WMI command header which should be located inside its data payload.  Implement sanity checking inside ath9k_wmi_ctrl_rx(). Otherwise, uninit memory can be referenced.  Tested on Qualcomm Atheros Communications AR9271 802.11n .
