This affects the ARM backend and can be demonstrated with Clang. NOTE: the vendor perspective is \"we don't have strong objections for a CVE to be created ... It does seem that the likelihood of this miscompile enabling an exploit remains very low, because the miscompile resulting in this JOP gadget is such that the function is most likely to crash on most valid inputs to the function. So, if this function is covered by any testing, the miscompile is most likely to be discovered before the binary is shipped to production.\"","affected":[{"package":{"name":"llvm-toolchain-14","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/llvm-toolchain-14?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:14.0.6-12","1:14.0.6-12+powerpc","1:14.0.6-13","1:14.0.6-14","1:14.0.6-16","1:14.0.6-16.1","1:14.0.6-16.1~exp1","1:14.0.6-17","1:14.0.6-18","1:14.0.6-19","1:14.0.6-20"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31852.json"}},{"package":{"name":"llvm-toolchain-15","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/llvm-toolchain-15?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:15.0.6-4","1:15.0.6-5~exp1","1:15.0.6-5~exp2","1:15.0.6-5~exp3","1:15.0.7-1","1:15.0.7-1+hurd.1","1:15.0.7-10","1:15.0.7-10.1~exp1","1:15.0.7-11","1:15.0.7-11.1","1:15.0.7-12","1:15.0.7-13","1:15.0.7-14","1:15.0.7-15","1:15.0.7-15+hurd.1","1:15.0.7-2","1:15.0.7-3","1:15.0.7-4","1:15.0.7-5","1:15.0.7-5~exp1","1:15.0.7-6","1:15.0.7-7","1:15.0.7-8","1:15.0.7-9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31852.json"}},{"package":{"name":"llvm-toolchain-16","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/llvm-toolchain-16?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:16.0.0-1~exp1","1:16.0.0-1~exp2","1:16.0.0-1~exp3","1:16.0.0-1~exp4","1:16.0.0-1~exp5","1:16.0.0~+rc1-1~exp1","1:16.0.0~+rc2-1~exp1","1:16.0.0~+rc3-1~exp1","1:16.0.0~+rc4-1~exp1","1:16.0.1-1~exp1","1:16.0.1-1~exp2","1:16.0.2-1~exp1","1:16.0.3-1~exp1","1:16.0.4-1~exp1","1:16.0.5-1","1:16.0.5-1~exp1","1:16.0.6-1","1:16.0.6-10","1:16.0.6-11","1:16.0.6-12","1:16.0.6-13","1:16.0.6-14","1:16.0.6-15","1:16.0.6-15+x32","1:16.0.6-15exp1","1:16.0.6-15~deb11u1","1:16.0.6-15~deb11u2","1:16.0.6-15~deb12u1","1:16.0.6-16","1:16.0.6-17","1:16.0.6-17exp1","1:16.0.6-18","1:16.0.6-19","1:16.0.6-19.1~exp1","1:16.0.6-2","1:16.0.6-20","1:16.0.6-21","1:16.0.6-22","1:16.0.6-23","1:16.0.6-24","1:16.0.6-25","1:16.0.6-26","1:16.0.6-27","1:16.0.6-27+hurd.1","1:16.0.6-27+x32","1:16.0.6-3","1:16.0.6-4","1:16.0.6-5","1:16.0.6-6","1:16.0.6-7","1:16.0.6-8","1:16.0.6-9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31852.json"}},{"package":{"name":"llvm-toolchain-16","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/llvm-toolchain-16?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:16.0.0-1~exp1","1:16.0.0-1~exp2","1:16.0.0-1~exp3","1:16.0.0-1~exp4","1:16.0.0-1~exp5","1:16.0.0~+rc1-1~exp1","1:16.0.0~+rc2-1~exp1","1:16.0.0~+rc3-1~exp1","1:16.0.0~+rc4-1~exp1","1:16.0.1-1~exp1","1:16.0.1-1~exp2","1:16.0.2-1~exp1","1:16.0.3-1~exp1","1:16.0.4-1~exp1","1:16.0.5-1","1:16.0.5-1~exp1","1:16.0.6-1","1:16.0.6-10","1:16.0.6-11","1:16.0.6-12","1:16.0.6-13","1:16.0.6-14","1:16.0.6-15","1:16.0.6-15+x32","1:16.0.6-15exp1","1:16.0.6-15~deb11u1","1:16.0.6-15~deb11u2","1:16.0.6-15~deb12u1","1:16.0.6-16","1:16.0.6-17","1:16.0.6-17exp1","1:16.0.6-18","1:16.0.6-19","1:16.0.6-19.1~exp1","1:16.0.6-2","1:16.0.6-20","1:16.0.6-21","1:16.0.6-22","1:16.0.6-23","1:16.0.6-24","1:16.0.6-25","1:16.0.6-26","1:16.0.6-27","1:16.0.6-27+hurd.1","1:16.0.6-27+x32","1:16.0.6-3","1:16.0.6-4","1:16.0.6-5","1:16.0.6-6","1:16.0.6-7","1:16.0.6-8","1:16.0.6-9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31852.json"}},{"package":{"name":"llvm-toolchain-17","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/llvm-toolchain-17?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:17.0.6-22"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31852.json"}},{"package":{"name":"llvm-toolchain-17","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/llvm-toolchain-17?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:17.0.6-22"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31852.json"}},{"package":{"name":"llvm-toolchain-18","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/llvm-toolchain-18?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:18.1.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31852.json"}},{"package":{"name":"llvm-toolchain-18","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/llvm-toolchain-18?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:1
