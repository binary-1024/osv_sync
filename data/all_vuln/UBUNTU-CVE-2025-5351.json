{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"UBUNTU-CVE-2025-5351","published":"2025-06-25T00:00:00Z","modified":"2025-09-08T17:06:50Z","related":["USN-7619-1"],"upstream":["CVE-2025-5351"],"details":"A flaw was found in the key export functionality of libssh. The issue occurs in the internal function responsible for converting cryptographic keys into serialized formats. During error handling, a memory structure is freed but not cleared, leading to a potential double free issue if an additional failure occurs later in the function. This condition may result in heap corruption or application instability in low-memory scenarios, posing a risk to system reliability where key export operations are performed.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libssh@0.10.6-2ubuntu0.1?arch=source&distro=noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.10.6-2ubuntu0.1"}]}],"versions":["0.10.5-3ubuntu1","0.10.5-3ubuntu2","0.10.6-2","0.10.6-2build1","0.10.6-2build2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"libssh-4","binary_version":"0.10.6-2ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"libssh-dev","binary_version":"0.10.6-2ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"libssh-gcrypt-4","binary_version":"0.10.6-2ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"libssh-gcrypt-dev","binary_version":"0.10.6-2ubuntu0.1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-5351.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.04","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libssh@0.11.1-1ubuntu0.1?arch=source&distro=plucky"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.11.1-1ubuntu0.1"}]}],"versions":["0.10.6-3ubuntu1","0.11.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"libssh-4","binary_version":"0.11.1-1ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"libssh-dev","binary_version":"0.11.1-1ubuntu0.1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-5351.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-5351"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-5351"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.libssh.org/security/advisories/CVE-2025-5351.txt"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7619-1"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"},{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
