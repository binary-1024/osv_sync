The timer callback, dl_task_timer, is supposed to decrement the reference count upon expiration. However, if enqueue_task_dl() is called before the timer expires and cancels it, the reference count is not decremented, leading to the leak.  This patch fixes the reference leak by ensuring the task_struct reference count is properly decremented when the timer is canceled.",
