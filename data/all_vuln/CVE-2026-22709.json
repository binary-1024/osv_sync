In vm2 prior to version 3.10.2, `Promise.prototype.then` `Promise.prototype.catch` callback sanitization can be bypassed. This allows attackers to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code. In lib/setup-sandbox.js, the callback function of `localPromise.prototype.then` is sanitized, but `globalPromise.prototype.then` is not sanitized. The return value of async functions is `globalPromise` object. Version 3.10.2 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4b009c2d4b1131c01810c1205e641d614c322a29"}]}],"versions":["3.9.10","3.9.11","3.9.12","3.9.13","3.9.14","3.9.15","3.9.16","3.9.17","3.9.18","3.9.19","3.9.3","3.9.4","3.9.5","3.9.6","3.9.7","3.9.8","3.9.9","v3.10.0","v3.10.1","v3.9.0","v3.9.1","v3.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22709.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22709.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/commit/4b009c2d4b1131c01810c1205e641d614c322a29"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/releases/tag/v3.10.2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/security/advisories/GHSA-99p7-6v5w-7xg8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22709"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-693","CWE-913","CWE-94"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22709.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
