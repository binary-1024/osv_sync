Some OSes (such as Linux, FreeBSD, and NetBSD) are processing watch events using a single thread. If the events are received faster than the thread is able to handle, they will get queued. As the queue is unbounded, a guest may be able to trigger an OOM in the backend. All systems with a FreeBSD, Linux, or NetBSD (any version) dom0 are vulnerable.","references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/02/msg00018.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/03/msg00010.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-30"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4843"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-349.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
