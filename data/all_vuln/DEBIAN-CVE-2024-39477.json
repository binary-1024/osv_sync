This is because vma_needs_reservation() can return -ENOMEM if allocate_file_region_entries() fails to allocate the file_region struct for the reservation.  Check for that and do not call vma_add_reservation() if that is the case, otherwise region_abort() and region_del() will see that we do not have any file_regions.  If we detect that vma_needs_reservation() returned -ENOMEM, we clear the hugetlb_restore_reserve flag as if this reservation was still consumed, so free_huge_folio() will not increment the resv count.
