Seen with syzkaller:  UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in net/mac80211/scan.c:1208:5 index 0 is out of range for type 'struct ieee80211_channel *[] __counted_by(n_channels)' (aka 'struct ieee80211_channel *[]')  This was missed in the initial conversions because I failed to locate the allocation likely due to the \"sizeof(void *)\" not matching the \"channels\" array type.",
