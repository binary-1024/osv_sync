  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dpll: fix dpll_pin_on_pin_register() for multiple parent pins  In scenario where pin is registered with multiple parent pins via dpll_pin_on_pin_register(..), all belonging to the same dpll device. A second call to dpll_pin_on_pin_unregister(..) would cause a call trace, as it tries to use already released registration resources (due to fix introduced in b446631f355e). In this scenario pin was registered twice, so resources are not yet expected to be release until each registered pin/pin pair is unregistered.  Currently, the following crash/call trace is produced when ice driver is removed on the system with installed E810T NIC which includes dpll device:  WARNING: CPU: 51 PID: 9155 at drivers/dpll/dpll_core.c:809 dpll_pin_ops+0x20/0x30 RIP: 0010:dpll_pin_ops+0x20/0x30 Call Trace:  ? __warn+0x7f/0x130  ? dpll_pin_ops+0x20/0x30  dpll_msg_add_pin_freq+0x37/0x1d0  dpll_cmd_pin_get_one+0x1c0/0x400  ? __nlmsg_put+0x63/0x80  dpll_pin_event_send+0x93/0x140  dpll_pin_on_pin_unregister+0x3f/0x100  ice_dpll_deinit_pins+0xa1/0x230 [ice]  ice_remove+0xf1/0x210 [ice]  Fix by adding a parent pointer as a cookie when creating a registration, also when searching for it.
