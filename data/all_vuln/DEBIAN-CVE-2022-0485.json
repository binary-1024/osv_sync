When performing multi-threaded copies using asynchronous nbd calls, nbdcopy was blindly treating the completion of an asynchronous command as successful, rather than checking the *error parameter. This could result in the silent creation of a corrupted destination image.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libnbd","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libnbd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.2-1","1.10.3-1","1.10.5-1","1.12.0-1","1.12.1-1","1.12.3-1","1.12.4-1","1.12.5-1","1.12.6-1","1.12.7-1","1.14.1-1","1.14.2-1","1.16.1-1","1.16.2-1","1.16.3-1","1.16.4-1","1.16.5-1","1.18.0-1","1.18.1-1","1.18.2-1","1.18.2-2","1.20.0-1","1.20.1-1","1.20.2-1","1.20.2-2","1.20.3-1","1.22.0-1","1.22.2-1","1.22.3-1","1.6.1-1","1.6.2-1","1.6.3-1","1.8.2-1","1.8.3-1","1.8.5-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-0485.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libnbd","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libnbd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.10.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-0485.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libnbd","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libnbd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.10.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-0485.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libnbd","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libnbd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.10.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-0485.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0485"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
