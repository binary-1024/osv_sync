This can lead to a out-of-bound write further when parsing the HTTP request, writing a NULL byte past the buffer. It's conceivable that an attacker controlled set of packets can lead to corruption of the GRUB2's internal memory metadata.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-28734"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230825-0002/"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/06/07/5"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H"}]}
