  "summary": "XWiki Change Request Application UI XSS and remote code execution through change request title",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nIt's possible for a user without any specific right to perform script injection and remote code execution just by inserting an appropriate title when creating a new Change Request. \nThis vulnerability is particularly critical as Change Request aims at being created by user without any particular rights.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been fixed in Change Request 1.9.2. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nIt's possible to workaround the issue without upgrading by editing the document `ChangeRequest.Code.ChangeRequestSheet` and by performing the same change as in the commit: https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-changerequest/commit/7565e720117f73102f5a276239eabfe85e15cff4. \n\n### References\n\n  * JIRA ticket: https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/CRAPP-298\n  * Commit of the fix: https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-changerequest/commit/7565e720117f73102f5a276239eabfe85e15cff4\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n\n### Attribution\n\nThanks Michael Hamann for the report.",
