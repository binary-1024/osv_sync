Versions prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 are vulnerable to a bypass in the plugin signature verification. An attacker can convince a server admin to download and successfully run a malicious plugin even though unsigned plugins are not allowed. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not install plugins downloaded from untrusted sources.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"grafana","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/grafana@2.6.0+dfsg-1?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.6.0+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"grafana","binary_version":"2.6.0+dfsg-1"},{"binary_name":"grafana-data","binary_version":"2.6.0+dfsg-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2022/UBUNTU-CVE-2022-31123.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-31123"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/advisories/GHSA-rhxj-gh46-jvw8"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana/releases/tag/v9.1.8"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-31123"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L"},{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"negligible"}]}
