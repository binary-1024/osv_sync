{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-71117","published":"2026-01-14T15:16:01.383Z","modified":"2026-01-15T11:18:03.759467Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-71117"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: Remove queue freezing from several sysfs store callbacks  Freezing the request queue from inside sysfs store callbacks may cause a deadlock in combination with the dm-multipath driver and the queue_if_no_path option. Additionally, freezing the request queue slows down system boot on systems where sysfs attributes are set synchronously.  Fix this by removing the blk_mq_freeze_queue() / blk_mq_unfreeze_queue() calls from the store callbacks that do not strictly need these callbacks. Add the __data_racy annotation to request_queue.rq_timeout to suppress KCSAN data race reports about the rq_timeout reads.  This patch may cause a small delay in applying the new settings.  For all the attributes affected by this patch, I/O will complete correctly whether the old or the new value of the attribute is used.  This patch affects the following sysfs attributes: * io_poll_delay * io_timeout * nomerges * read_ahead_kb * rq_affinity  Here is an example of a deadlock triggered by running test srp/002 if this patch is not applied:  task:multipathd Call Trace:  <TASK>  __schedule+0x8c1/0x1bf0  schedule+0xdd/0x270  schedule_preempt_disabled+0x1c/0x30  __mutex_lock+0xb89/0x1650  mutex_lock_nested+0x1f/0x30  dm_table_set_restrictions+0x823/0xdf0  __bind+0x166/0x590  dm_swap_table+0x2a7/0x490  do_resume+0x1b1/0x610  dev_suspend+0x55/0x1a0  ctl_ioctl+0x3a5/0x7e0  dm_ctl_ioctl+0x12/0x20  __x64_sys_ioctl+0x127/0x1a0  x64_sys_call+0xe2b/0x17d0  do_syscall_64+0x96/0x3a0  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53  </TASK> task:(udev-worker) Call Trace:  <TASK>  __schedule+0x8c1/0x1bf0  schedule+0xdd/0x270  blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait+0xf2/0x140  blk_mq_freeze_queue_nomemsave+0x23/0x30  queue_ra_store+0x14e/0x290  queue_attr_store+0x23e/0x2c0  sysfs_kf_write+0xde/0x140  kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x3b2/0x630  vfs_write+0x4fd/0x1390  ksys_write+0xfd/0x230  __x64_sys_write+0x76/0xc0  x64_sys_call+0x276/0x17d0  do_syscall_64+0x96/0x3a0  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53  </TASK>","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.57-1","6.12.57-1~bpo12+1","6.12.63-1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.10-1","6.16.11-1","6.16.12-1","6.16.12-1~bpo13+1","6.16.12-2","6.16.3-1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16.5-1","6.16.6-1","6.16.7-1","6.16.8-1","6.16.9-1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1","6.17.10-1","6.17.11-1","6.17.12-1","6.17.13-1","6.17.13-1~bpo13+1","6.17.2-1~exp1","6.17.5-1~exp1","6.17.6-1","6.17.7-1","6.17.7-2","6.17.8-1","6.17.8-1~bpo13+1","6.17.9-1","6.18.1-1~exp1","6.18.2-1~exp1","6.18.3-1","6.18~rc4-1~exp1","6.18~rc4-1~exp2","6.18~rc5-1~exp1","6.18~rc6-1~exp1","6.18~rc7-1~exp1","6.19~rc4-1~exp1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-71117.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.57-1","6.12.57-1~bpo12+1","6.12.63-1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.10-1","6.16.11-1","6.16.12-1","6.16.12-1~bpo13+1","6.16.12-2","6.16.3-1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16.5-1","6.16.6-1","6.16.7-1","6.16.8-1","6.16.9-1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1","6.17.10-1","6.17.11-1","6.17.12-1","6.17.13-1","6.17.13-1~bpo13+1","6.17.2-1~exp1","6.17.5-1~exp1","6.17.6-1","6.17.7-1","6.17.7-2","6.17.8-1","6.17.8-1~bpo13+1","6.17.9-1","6.18.1-1~exp1","6.18.2-1~exp1","6.18.3-1","6.18~rc4-1~exp1","6.18~rc4-1~exp2","6.18~rc5-1~exp1","6.18~rc6-1~exp1","6.18~rc7-1~exp1","6.19~rc4-1~exp1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-71117.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-71117"}]}
