{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50636","published":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","modified":"2025-12-09T07:18:34.422125Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-50636"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: Fix pci_device_is_present() for VFs by checking PF  pci_device_is_present() previously didn't work for VFs because it reads the Vendor and Device ID, which are 0xffff for VFs, which looks like they aren't present.  Check the PF instead.  Wei Gong reported that if virtio I/O is in progress when the driver is unbound or \"0\" is written to /sys/.../sriov_numvfs, the virtio I/O operation hangs, which may result in output like this:    task:bash state:D stack:    0 pid: 1773 ppid:  1241 flags:0x00004002   Call Trace:    schedule+0x4f/0xc0    blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait+0x69/0xa0    blk_mq_freeze_queue+0x1b/0x20    blk_cleanup_queue+0x3d/0xd0    virtblk_remove+0x3c/0xb0 [virtio_blk]    virtio_dev_remove+0x4b/0x80    ...    device_unregister+0x1b/0x60    unregister_virtio_device+0x18/0x30    virtio_pci_remove+0x41/0x80    pci_device_remove+0x3e/0xb0  This happened because pci_device_is_present(VF) returned \"false\" in virtio_pci_remove(), so it called virtio_break_device().  The broken vq meant that vring_interrupt() skipped the vq.callback() that would have completed the virtio I/O operation via virtblk_done().
