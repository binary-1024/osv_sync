This issue affects all Apache Solr versions up through Solr 9.7.  Users can protect against the vulnerability by enabling authentication and authorization on their Solr clusters or switching to SolrCloud (and away from \"FileSystemConfigSetService\").  Users are also recommended to upgrade to Solr 9.8.0, which mitigates this issue by disabling use of \"<lib>\" tags by default.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"lucene-solr","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/lucene-solr?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.2+dfsg-23"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-24814.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lucene-solr","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/lucene-solr?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.2+dfsg-23"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-24814.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lucene-solr","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/lucene-solr?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.2+dfsg-23"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-24814.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lucene-solr","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/lucene-solr?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.2+dfsg-23"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-24814.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-24814"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
