Prior to versions 3.4.26 and 3.5.9, the LeaseTimeToLive API allows access to key names (not value) associated to a lease when `Keys` parameter is true, even a user doesn't have read permission to the keys. The impact is limited to a cluster which enables auth (RBAC). Versions 3.4.26 and 3.5.9 fix this issue. There are no known workarounds.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"etcd","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/etcd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.3.25+dfsg-6","3.3.25+dfsg-7","3.3.25+dfsg-8","3.4.23-1","3.4.23-2","3.4.23-3","3.4.23-4","3.4.23-5","3.4.23-6","3.4.30-1","3.4.30-2","3.4.30-3","3.5.15-1","3.5.15-2","3.5.15-3","3.5.15-4","3.5.15-5","3.5.15-6","3.5.15-7","3.5.16-1","3.5.16-2","3.5.16-3","3.5.16-4","3.5.16-5","3.5.16-6","3.5.16-7","3.5.22-1","3.5.22-2","3.5.5-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-32082.json"}},{"package":{"name":"etcd","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/etcd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.4.23-4","3.4.23-5","3.4.23-6","3.4.30-1","3.4.30-2","3.4.30-3","3.5.15-1","3.5.15-2","3.5.15-3","3.5.15-4","3.5.15-5","3.5.15-6","3.5.15-7","3.5.16-1","3.5.16-2","3.5.16-3","3.5.16-4","3.5.16-5","3.5.16-6","3.5.16-7","3.5.22-1","3.5.22-2","3.5.5-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-32082.json"}},{"package":{"name":"etcd","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/etcd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.4.30-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-32082.json"}},{"package":{"name":"etcd","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/etcd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.4.30-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-32082.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-32082"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
