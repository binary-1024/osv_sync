TQPs 0-1023 and TQPs 1024-1279 are in different BAR space addresses. However, hclge_fetch_pf_reg does not distinguish the tqp space information when reading the tqp space information. When the number of TQPs is greater than 1024, access bar space overwriting occurs. The problem of different segments has been considered during the initialization of tqp.io_base. Therefore, tqp.io_base is directly used when the queue is read in hclge_fetch_pf_reg.
