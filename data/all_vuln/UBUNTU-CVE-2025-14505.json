{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"UBUNTU-CVE-2025-14505","published":"2026-01-08T21:15:00Z","modified":"2026-01-20T18:16:04.976380Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-14505"],"details":"The ECDSA implementation of the Elliptic package generates incorrect signatures if an interim value of 'k' (as computed based on step 3.2 of RFC 6979 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6979 ) has leading zeros and is susceptible to cryptanalysis, which can lead to secret key exposure. This happens, because the byte-length of 'k' is incorrectly computed, resulting in its getting truncated during the computation. Legitimate transactions or communications will be broken as a result. Furthermore, due to the nature of the fault, attackers could–under certain conditions–derive the secret key, if they could get their hands on both a faulty signature generated by a vulnerable version of Elliptic and a correct signature for the same inputs. This issue affects all known versions of Elliptic (at the time of writing, versions less than or equal to 6.6.1).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"node-elliptic","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/node-elliptic@6.4.0+dfsg-1?arch=source&distro=bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.4.0+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"node-elliptic","binary_version":"6.4.0+dfsg-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-14505.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-elliptic","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:20.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/node-elliptic@6.5.1~dfsg-2?arch=source&distro=focal"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.5.1~dfsg-1","6.5.1~dfsg-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"node-elliptic","binary_version":"6.5.1~dfsg-2"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-14505.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-elliptic","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:22.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/node-elliptic@6.5.4~dfsg-1?arch=source&distro=jammy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.5.4~dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"node-elliptic","binary_version":"6.5.4~dfsg-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-14505.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-elliptic","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/node-elliptic@6.5.4~dfsg-2?arch=source&distro=noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.5.4~dfsg-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"node-elliptic","binary_version":"6.5.4~dfsg-2"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-14505.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-elliptic","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.10","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/node-elliptic@6.6.1+dfsg-1?arch=source&distro=questing"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.6.1+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"node-elliptic","binary_version":"6.6.1+dfsg-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-14505.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-14505"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14505"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/indutny/elliptic/issues/321"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
