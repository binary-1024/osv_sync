  "details": "Updated nvidia-current packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nNVIDIA GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode\nlayer, where an unprivileged regular user on the network can cause an\nout-of-bounds write through a specially crafted shader, which may lead\nto code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges,\ninformation disclosure, and data tampering. The scope of the impact may\nextend to other components (CVE\u20112022\u201128181).\n\nNVIDIA GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode\nlayer, where an unprivileged regular user can cause an out-of-bounds\nread, which may lead to denial of service and information disclosure\n(CVE\u20112022\u201128183).\n\nNVIDIA GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode\nlayer (nvlddmkm.sys) handler for DxgkDdiEscape, where an unprivileged\nregular user can access administrator- privileged registers, which may\nlead to denial of service, information disclosure, and data tampering\n(CVE\u20112022\u201128184).\n\nNVIDIA GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the ECC layer, where\nan unprivileged regular user can cause an out-of-bounds write, which may\nlead to denial of service and data tampering (CVE\u20112022\u201128185).\n\nNVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the Virtual GPU Manager\n(nvidia.ko), where uncontrolled resource consumption can be triggered by\nan unprivileged regular user, which may lead to denial of service\n(CVE\u20112022\u201128191).\n\nNVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the Virtual GPU Manager\n(nvidia.ko), where it may lead to a use-after-free, which in turn may\ncause denial of service. This attack is complex to carry out because the\nattacker needs to have control over freeing some host side resources out\nof sequence, which requires elevated privileges (CVE\u20112022\u201128192).\n\nThis update also contains the following:\n\n* Adds support for the following GPUs:\n  GeForce RTX 3050\n  GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Laptop GPU\n  GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Laptop GPU\n  GeForce RTX 3090 Ti\n  RTX A500 Laptop GPU\n  RTX A1000 Laptop GPU\n  RTX A2000 8GB Laptop GPU\n  RTX A3000 12GB Laptop GPU\n  RTX A4500 Laptop GPU\n  RTX A5500 Laptop GPU\n  T550 Laptop GPU\n\n* Fixes an issue where NvFBC was requesting Vulkan 1.0 while using Vulkan\n  1.1 core features. This caused NvFBC to fail to initialize with Vulkan\n  loader versions 1.3.204 or newer.\n\n* Added an application profile to avoid an image corruption issue in\n  Blender, as described at https://developer.blender.org/\n",
