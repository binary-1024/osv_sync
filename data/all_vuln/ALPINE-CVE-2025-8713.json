{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2025-8713","published":"2025-08-14T13:15:37.543Z","modified":"2025-11-19T05:58:11.576264Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-8713"],"details":"PostgreSQL optimizer statistics allow a user to read sampled data within a view that the user cannot access.  Separately, statistics allow a user to read sampled data that a row security policy intended to hide.  PostgreSQL maintains statistics for tables by sampling data available in columns; this data is consulted during the query planning process.  Prior to this release, a user could craft a leaky operator that bypassed view access control lists (ACLs) and bypassed row security policies in partitioning or table inheritance hierarchies.  Reachable statistics data notably included histograms and most-common-values lists.  CVE-2017-7484 and CVE-2019-10130 intended to close this class of vulnerability, but this gap remained.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.6, 16.10, 15.14, 14.19, and 13.22 are affected.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"postgresql15","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/postgresql15?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"15.14-r0"}]}],"versions":["15.1-r0","15.1-r1","15.10-r0","15.11-r0","15.13-r0","15.2-r0","15.2-r1","15.2-r2","15.2-r3","15.2-r4","15.3-r0","15.3-r1","15.4-r0","15.4-r1","15.4-r2","15.5-r0","15.6-r0","15.7-r0","15.8-r0","15.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-8713.json"}},{"package":{"name":"postgresql15","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/postgresql15?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"15.14-r0"}]}],"versions":["15.1-r0","15.1-r1","15.10-r0","15.11-r0","15.13-r0","15.2-r0","15.2-r1","15.2-r2","15.2-r3","15.2-r4","15.3-r0","15.3-r1","15.4-r0","15.4-r1","15.4-r2","15.5-r0","15.6-r0","15.6-r1","15.6-r2","15.7-r0","15.8-r0","15.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-8713.json"}},{"package":{"name":"postgresql16","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/postgresql16?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"16.10-r0"}]}],"versions":["16.0-r0","16.0-r1","16.0-r2","16.1-r0","16.2-r0","16.2-r1","16.3-r0","16.4-r0","16.5-r0","16.6-r0","16.8-r0","16.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-8713.json"}},{"package":{"name":"postgresql16","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/postgresql16?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"16.10-r0"}]}],"versions":["16.0-r0","16.0-r1","16.0-r2","16.1-r0","16.2-r0","16.2-r1","16.2-r2","16.2-r3","16.2-r4","16.3-r0","16.4-r0","16.5-r0","16.6-r0","16.8-r0","16.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-8713.json"}},{"package":{"name":"postgresql16","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/postgresql16?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"16.10-r0"}]}],"versions":["16.0-r0","16.0-r1","16.0-r2","16.1-r0","16.2-r0","16.2-r1","16.2-r2","16.2-r3","16.2-r4","16.3-r0","16.3-r1","16.4-r0","16.4-r1","16.5-r0","16.6-r0","16.8-r0","16.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-8713.json"}},{"package":{"name":"postgresql16","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/postgresql16?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"16.10-r0"}]}],"versions":["16.0-r0","16.0-r1","16.0-r2","16.1-r0","16.2-r0","16.2-r1","16.2-r2","16.2-r3","16.2-r4","16.3-r0","16.3-r1","16.4-r0","16.4-r1","16.5-r0","16.6-r0","16.8-r0","16.8-r1","16.8-r2","16.8-r3","16.8-r4","16.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-8713.json"}},{"package":{"name":"postgresql17","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/postgresql17?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"17.6-r0"}]}],"versions":["17.0-r0","17.0-r1","17.1-r0","17.2-r0","17.4-r0","17.5-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-8713.json"}},{"package":{"name":"postgresql17","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/postgresql17?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"17.6-r0"}]}],"versions":["17.0-r0","17.0-r1","17.1-r0","17.2-r0","17.4-r0","17.4-r1","17.4-r2","17.4-r3","17.4-r4","17.5-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-8713.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2025-8713"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
