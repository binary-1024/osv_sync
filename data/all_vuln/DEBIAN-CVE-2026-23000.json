{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2026-23000","published":"2026-01-25T15:15:54.853Z","modified":"2026-01-26T11:16:04.374559Z","upstream":["CVE-2026-23000"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5e: Fix crash on profile change rollback failure  mlx5e_netdev_change_profile can fail to attach a new profile and can fail to rollback to old profile, in such case, we could end up with a dangling netdev with a fully reset netdev_priv. A retry to change profile, e.g. another attempt to call mlx5e_netdev_change_profile via switchdev mode change, will crash trying to access the now NULL priv->mdev.  This fix allows mlx5e_netdev_change_profile() to handle previous failures and an empty priv, by not assuming priv is valid.  Pass netdev and mdev to all flows requiring mlx5e_netdev_change_profile() and avoid passing priv. In mlx5e_netdev_change_profile() check if current priv is valid, and if not, just attach the new profile without trying to access the old one.  This fixes the following oops, when enabling switchdev mode for the 2nd time after first time failure:   ## Enabling switchdev mode first time:  mlx5_core 0012:03:00.1: E-Switch: Supported tc chains
