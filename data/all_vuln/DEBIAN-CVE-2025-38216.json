This inadvertently introduced a regression affecting PCI aliased devices behind PCIe-to-PCI bridges.  Specifically, keyboard and touchpad stopped working on several Apple Macbooks with below messages:   kernel: platform pxa2xx-spi.3: Adding to iommu group 20  kernel: input: Apple SPI Keyboard as  /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.3/pxa2xx-spi.3/spi_master/spi2/spi-APP000D:00/input/input0  kernel: DMAR: DRHD: handling fault status reg 3  kernel: DMAR: [DMA Read NO_PASID] Request device [00:1e.3] fault addr  0xffffa000 [fault reason 0x06] PTE Read access is not set  kernel: DMAR: DRHD: handling fault status reg 3  kernel: DMAR: [DMA Read NO_PASID] Request device [00:1e.3] fault addr  0xffffa000 [fault reason 0x06] PTE Read access is not set  kernel: applespi spi-APP000D:00: Error writing to device: 01 0e 00 00  kernel: DMAR: DRHD: handling fault status reg 3  kernel: DMAR: [DMA Read NO_PASID] Request device [00:1e.3] fault addr  0xffffa000 [fault reason 0x06] PTE Read access is not set  kernel: DMAR: DRHD: handling fault status reg 3  kernel: applespi spi-APP000D:00: Error writing to device: 01 0e 00 00  Fix this by restoring the previous context setup order.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.35-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-38216.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.35-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-38216.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-38216"}]}
