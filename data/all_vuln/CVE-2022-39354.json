A custom stateful precompile can use the `is_static` parameter to determine if the call is executed in a static context (via `STATICCALL`), and thus decide if stateful operations should be done. Prior to version 0.36.0, the passed `is_static` parameter was incorrect -- it was only set to `true` if the call came from a direct `STATICCALL` opcode. However, once a static call context is entered, it should stay static. The issue only impacts custom precompiles that actually uses `is_static`. For those affected, the issue can lead to possible incorrect state transitions. Version 0.36.0 contains a patch. There are no known workarounds.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-39354.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.36.0"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm/security/advisories/GHSA-hhc4-47rh-cr34"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm/pull/133"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
