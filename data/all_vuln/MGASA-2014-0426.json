  "details": "Updated qemu packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nMichael S. Tsirkin discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled vmxnet3 devices.\nA local guest could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service, or\npossibly execute arbitrary code on the host (CVE-2013-4544).\n\nMultiple integer overflow, input validation, logic error, and buffer\noverflow flaws were discovered in various QEMU block drivers. An attacker\nable to modify a disk image file loaded by a guest could use these flaws to\ncrash the guest, or corrupt QEMU process memory on the host, potentially\nresulting in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of\nthe QEMU process (CVE-2014-0143, CVE-2014-0144, CVE-2014-0145,\nCVE-2014-0147).\n\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the virtio_net_handle_mac()\nfunction of QEMU processed guest requests to update the table of MAC\naddresses. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to corrupt QEMU\nprocess memory on the host, potentially resulting in arbitrary code\nexecution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process\n(CVE-2014-0150).\n\nA divide-by-zero flaw was found in the seek_to_sector() function of the\nparallels block driver in QEMU. An attacker able to modify a disk image\nfile loaded by a guest could use this flaw to crash the guest\n(CVE-2014-0142).\n\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the QCOW2 block driver in\nQEMU. An attacker able to modify a disk image file loaded by a guest could\nuse this flaw to crash the guest (CVE-2014-0146).\n\nIt was found that the block driver for Hyper-V VHDX images did not\ncorrectly calculate BAT (Block Allocation Table) entries due to a missing\nbounds check. An attacker able to modify a disk image file loaded by a\nguest could use this flaw to crash the guest (CVE-2014-0148).\n\nAn out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the way QEMU's IDE device\ndriver handled the execution of SMART EXECUTE OFFLINE commands.\nA privileged guest user could use this flaw to corrupt QEMU process memory\non the host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code execution on\nthe host with the privileges of the QEMU process (CVE-2014-2894).\n\nTwo integer overflow flaws were found in the QEMU block driver for QCOW\nversion 1 disk images. A user able to alter the QEMU disk image files\nloaded by a guest could use either of these flaws to corrupt QEMU process\nmemory on the host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code\nexecution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process\n(CVE-2014-0222, CVE-2014-0223).\n\nMultiple buffer overflow, input validation, and out-of-bounds write flaws\nwere found in the way the virtio, virtio-net, virtio-scsi, and usb drivers\nof QEMU handled state loading after migration. A user able to alter the\nsavevm data (either on the disk or over the wire during migration) could\nuse either of these flaws to corrupt QEMU process memory on the\n(destination) host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code\nexecution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process\n(CVE-2013-4148, CVE-2013-4151, CVE-2013-4535, CVE-2013-4536, CVE-2013-4541,\nCVE-2013-4542, CVE-2013-6399, CVE-2014-0182, CVE-2014-3461).\n\nAn information leak flaw was found in the way QEMU's VGA emulator accessed\nframe buffer memory for high resolution displays. A privileged guest user\ncould use this flaw to leak memory contents of the host to the guest by\nsetting the display to use a high resolution in the guest (CVE-2014-3615).\n\nWhen guest sends udp packet with source port and source addr 0,\nuninitialized socket is picked up when looking for matching and already\ncreated udp sockets, and later passed to sosendto() where NULL pointer\ndereference is hit during so->slirp->vnetwork_mask.s_addr access\nOnly guests using qemu user networking are affected (CVE-2014-3640).\n",
