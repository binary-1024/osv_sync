The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, are de-allocated when a guest switches (back) from v2 to v1. Freeing such pages requires that the hypervisor enforce that no parallel request can result in the addition of a mapping of such a page to a guest. That enforcement was missing, allowing guests to retain access to pages that were freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes. Unfortunately, when XSA-379 was being prepared, this similar issue was not noticed.","references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/09/08/2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-384.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-23"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4977"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-384.txt"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3HEHUIUWSSMCQGQY3GWX4J2SZGYP5W2Z/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CEHZLIR5DFYYQBH55AERWHLO54OFU42C/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/L4MI3MQAPGILCLXBGQWPZHGE3ALSO4ZU/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
