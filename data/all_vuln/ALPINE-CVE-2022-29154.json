The server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the rsync client performs insufficient validation of file names. A malicious rsync server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the rsync client target directory and subdirectories (for example, overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.2.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6","3.1.2-r7","3.1.3-r0","3.1.3-r1","3.1.3-r2","3.1.3-r3","3.2.2-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.3-r1","3.2.3-r2","3.2.3-r3","3.2.3-r4","3.2.3-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-29154.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.2.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6","3.1.2-r7","3.1.3-r0","3.1.3-r1","3.1.3-r2","3.1.3-r3","3.2.2-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.3-r1","3.2.3-r2","3.2.3-r3","3.2.3-r4","3.2.3-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-29154.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.2.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6","3.1.2-r7","3.1.3-r0","3.1.3-r1","3.1.3-r2","3.1.3-r3","3.2.2-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.3-r1","3.2.3-r2","3.2.3-r3","3.2.3-r4","3.2.3-r5","3.2.3-r6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-29154.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.2.4-r2"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6","3.1.2-r7","3.1.3-r0","3.1.3-r1","3.1.3-r2","3.1.3-r3","3.2.2-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.3-r1","3.2.3-r2","3.2.3-r3","3.2.3-r4","3.2.3-r5","3.2.4-r0","3.2.4-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-29154.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.2.4-r2"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6","3.1.2-r7","3.1.3-r0","3.1.3-r1","3.1.3-r2","3.1.3-r3","3.2.2-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.3-r1","3.2.3-r2","3.2.3-r3","3.2.3-r4","3.2.3-r5","3.2.4-r0","3.2.4-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-29154.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.2.4-r2"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6","3.1.2-r7","3.1.3-r0","3.1.3-r1","3.1.3-r2","3.1.3-r3","3.2.2-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.3-r1","3.2.3-r2","3.2.3-r3","3.2.3-r4","3.2.3-r5","3.2.4-r0","3.2.4-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-29154.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.2.4-r2"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6","3.1.2-r7","3.1.3-r0","3.1.3-r1","3.1.3-r2","3.1.3-r3","3.2.2-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.3-r1","3.2.3-r2","3.2.3-r3","3.2.3-r4","3.2.3-r5","3.2.4-r0","3.2.4-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-29154.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.2.4-r2"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6","3.1.2-r7","3.1.3-r0","3.1.3-r1","3.1.3-r2","3.1.3-r3","3.2.2-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.3-r1","3.2
