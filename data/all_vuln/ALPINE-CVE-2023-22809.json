{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2023-22809","published":"2023-01-18T17:15:10Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:25:16.476133Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-22809"],"details":"In Sudo before 1.9.12p2, the sudoedit (aka -e) feature mishandles extra arguments passed in the user-provided environment variables (SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR), allowing a local attacker to append arbitrary entries to the list of files to process. This can lead to privilege escalation. Affected versions are 1.8.0 through 1.9.12.p1. The problem exists because a user-specified editor may contain a \"--\" argument that defeats a protection mechanism, e.g., an EDITOR='vim -- /path/to/extra/file' value.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"sudo","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/sudo?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.12_p2-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.6.9_p17-r1","1.7.0-r0","1.7.1-r0","1.7.2-r0","1.7.2_p1-r0","1.7.2_p2-r0","1.7.2_p4-r0","1.7.2_p5-r0","1.7.2_p6-r0","1.7.2_p6-r1","1.7.2_p7-r0","1.7.3-r0","1.7.4_p2-r0","1.7.4_p3-r0","1.7.4_p4-r0","1.7.4_p5-r0","1.7.4p6-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.8.0-r1","1.8.1-r0","1.8.10-r0","1.8.10_p1-r0","1.8.10_p2-r0","1.8.10_p3-r0","1.8.11_p2-r0","1.8.12-r0","1.8.13-r0","1.8.14_p3-r0","1.8.14_p3-r1","1.8.15-r0","1.8.15-r1","1.8.16-r0","1.8.17-r0","1.8.17_p1-r0","1.8.18-r0","1.8.18_p1-r0","1.8.19_p1-r0","1.8.19_p2-r0","1.8.1p1-r0","1.8.2-r0","1.8.20_p1-r0","1.8.20_p2-r0","1.8.21_p2-r0","1.8.21_p2-r1","1.8.21_p2-r2","1.8.22-r2","1.8.23-r2","1.8.25_p1-r2","1.8.27-r0","1.8.28-r0","1.8.28p1-r0","1.8.29-r0","1.8.3-r0","1.8.30-r0","1.8.31-r0","1.8.31p1-r0","1.8.31p1-r1","1.8.3_p1-r0","1.8.3_p2-r0","1.8.3_p2-r1","1.8.4-r0","1.8.4_p1-r0","1.8.4_p2-r0","1.8.4_p4-r0","1.8.5_p1-r0","1.8.5_p2-r0","1.8.5_p3-r0","1.8.6-r0","1.8.6_p1-r0","1.8.6_p3-r0","1.8.6_p4-r0","1.8.6_p5-r0","1.8.6_p6-r0","1.8.6_p7-r0","1.8.6_p8-r0","1.8.7-r0","1.8.8-r0","1.8.9_p4-r0","1.8.9_p5-r0","1.9.0-r0","1.9.1-r0","1.9.12-r0","1.9.12-r1","1.9.3-r0","1.9.3_p1-r0","1.9.4-r0","1.9.4p2-r0","1.9.5-r0","1.9.5p1-r0","1.9.5p2-r0","1.9.6-r0","1.9.6_p1-r0","1.9.6_p1-r1","1.9.7_p1-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-22809.json"}},{"package":{"name":"sudo","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/sudo?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.12_p2-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.6.9_p17-r1","1.7.0-r0","1.7.1-r0","1.7.2-r0","1.7.2_p1-r0","1.7.2_p2-r0","1.7.2_p4-r0","1.7.2_p5-r0","1.7.2_p6-r0","1.7.2_p6-r1","1.7.2_p7-r0","1.7.3-r0","1.7.4_p2-r0","1.7.4_p3-r0","1.7.4_p4-r0","1.7.4_p5-r0","1.7.4p6-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.8.0-r1","1.8.1-r0","1.8.10-r0","1.8.10_p1-r0","1.8.10_p2-r0","1.8.10_p3-r0","1.8.11_p2-r0","1.8.12-r0","1.8.13-r0","1.8.14_p3-r0","1.8.14_p3-r1","1.8.15-r0","1.8.15-r1","1.8.16-r0","1.8.17-r0","1.8.17_p1-r0","1.8.18-r0","1.8.18_p1-r0","1.8.19_p1-r0","1.8.19_p2-r0","1.8.1p1-r0","1.8.2-r0","1.8.20_p1-r0","1.8.20_p2-r0","1.8.21_p2-r0","1.8.21_p2-r1","1.8.21_p2-r2","1.8.22-r2","1.8.23-r2","1.8.25_p1-r2","1.8.27-r0","1.8.28-r0","1.8.28p1-r0","1.8.29-r0","1.8.3-r0","1.8.30-r0","1.8.31-r0","1.8.31p1-r0","1.8.31p1-r1","1.8.3_p1-r0","1.8.3_p2-r0","1.8.3_p2-r1","1.8.4-r0","1.8.4_p1-r0","1.8.4_p2-r0","1.8.4_p4-r0","1.8.5_p1-r0","1.8.5_p2-r0","1.8.5_p3-r0","1.8.6-r0","1.8.6_p1-r0","1.8.6_p3-r0","1.8.6_p4-r0","1.8.6_p5-r0","1.8.6_p6-r0","1.8.6_p7-r0","1.8.6_p8-r0","1.8.7-r0","1.8.8-r0","1.8.9_p4-r0","1.8.9_p5-r0","1.9.0-r0","1.9.1-r0","1.9.12-r0","1.9.12-r1","1.9.3-r0","1.9.3_p1-r0","1.9.4-r0","1.9.4p2-r0","1.9.5-r0","1.9.5p1-r0","1.9.5p2-r0","1.9.6-r0","1.9.6_p1-r0","1.9.6_p1-r1","1.9.7_p1-r1","1.9.7_p2-r0","1.9.8-r0","1.9.8_p1-r0","1.9.8_p2-r0","1.9.8_p2-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-22809.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2023-22809"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
