In 2.8.0 and earlier, the code checks if the userRole is \"admin\" only when visiting the /admin page, but not when visiting its subroutes. Specifically, only the file routes/adminPanel.py checks the user role when a user is trying to access the admin page, but that control is not done for the pages routes/adminPanelComments.py and routes/adminPanelPosts.py. Thus, an unauthorized user can bypass the intended restrictions, leaking sensitive data and accessing the following pages: /admin/posts, /adminpanel/posts, /admin/comments, and /adminpanel/comments.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-55734.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/DogukanUrker/FlaskBlog/security/advisories/GHSA-h239-vv39-v3vx"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/DogukanUrker/FlaskBlog/security/advisories/GHSA-jw79-2xvp-76p8"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-862"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
