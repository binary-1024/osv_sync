  "details": "Many places in the Yahoo! protocol plugin assumed incoming strings were\nUTF-8 and failed to transcode from non-UTF-8 encodings. This can lead to a\ncrash  when receiving strings that aren't UTF-8 (CVE-2012-6152).\n\nA remote XMPP user can trigger a crash on some systems by sending a\nmessage with a timestamp in the distant future (CVE-2013-6477).\n\nlibX11 forcefully exits causing a crash when Pidgin tries to create an\nexceptionally wide tooltip window when hovering the pointer over a long\nURL (CVE-2013-6478).\n\nA malicious server or man-in-the-middle could send a malformed HTTP\nresponse that could lead to a crash (CVE-2013-6479).\n\nThe Yahoo! protocol plugin failed to validate a length field before trying\nto read from a buffer, which could result in reading past the end of the\nbuffer which could cause a crash when reading a P2P message\n(CVE-2013-6481).\n\nNULL pointer dereferences in the MSN protocol plugin due to a malformed\nContent-Length header, or a malicious server or man-in-the-middle sending\na specially crafted OIM data XML response or SOAP response\n(CVE-2013-6482).\n\nThe XMPP protocol plugin failed to ensure that iq replies came from the\nperson they were sent to. A remote user could send a spoofed iq reply and\nattempt to guess the iq id. This could allow an attacker to inject fake\ndata or trigger a null pointer dereference (CVE-2013-6483).\n\nIncorrect error handling when reading the response from a STUN server\ncould lead to a crash (CVE-2013-6484).\n\nA malicious server or man-in-the-middle could cause a buffer overflow by\nsending a malformed HTTP response with chunked Transfer-Encoding with\ninvalid chunk sizes (CVE-2013-6485).\n\nA malicious server or man-in-the-middle could send a large value for\nContent-Length and cause an integer overflow which could lead to a buffer\noverflow in Gadu-Gadu HTTP parsing (CVE-2013-6487).\n\nA specially crafted emoticon value could cause an integer overflow which\ncould lead to a buffer overflow in MXit emoticon parsing (CVE-2013-6489).\n\nA Content-Length of -1 could lead to a buffer overflow in SIMPLE header\nparsing (CVE-2013-6490).\n\nA malicious server or man-in-the-middle could trigger a crash in IRC\nargument parsing in libpurple by sending a message with fewer than\nexpected arguments\n(CVE-2014-0020).\n",
