{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47454","published":"2024-05-22T07:15:10Z","modified":"2025-09-30T09:15:15.982883Z","upstream":["CVE-2021-47454"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/smp: do not decrement idle task preempt count in CPU offline  With PREEMPT_COUNT=y, when a CPU is offlined and then onlined again, we get:  BUG: scheduling while atomic: swapper/1/0/0x00000000 no locks held by swapper/1/0. CPU: 1 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/1 Not tainted 5.15.0-rc2+ #100 Call Trace:  dump_stack_lvl+0xac/0x108  __schedule_bug+0xac/0xe0  __schedule+0xcf8/0x10d0  schedule_idle+0x3c/0x70  do_idle+0x2d8/0x4a0  cpu_startup_entry+0x38/0x40  start_secondary+0x2ec/0x3a0  start_secondary_prolog+0x10/0x14  This is because powerpc's arch_cpu_idle_dead() decrements the idle task's preempt count, for reasons explained in commit a7c2bb8279d2 (\"powerpc: Re-enable preemption before cpu_die()\"), specifically \"start_secondary() expects a preempt_count() of 0.\"  However, since commit 2c669ef6979c (\"powerpc/preempt: Don't touch the idle task's preempt_count during hotplug\") and commit f1a0a376ca0c (\"sched/core: Initialize the idle task with preemption disabled\"), that justification no longer holds.  The idle task isn't supposed to re-enable preemption, so remove the vestigial preempt_enable() from the CPU offline path.  Tested with pseries and powernv in qemu, and pseries on PowerVM.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.84-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47454.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.14.16-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47454.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.14.16-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47454.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.14.16-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47454.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-47454"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
