The overflow happens due to an addition operation involving a user-controlled value parsed from the PE binary being used by Shim. This value is further used for memory allocation operations, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. This flaw causes memory corruption and can lead to a crash or data integrity issues during the boot phase.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"shim","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/shim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"15.8-1~deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["15.4-7","15.6-1","15.6-1~deb10u1","15.6-1~deb11u1","15.7-1","15.7-1~deb10u1","15.7-1~deb11u1","15.8-1~deb10u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-40548.json"}},{"package":{"name":"shim","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/shim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"15.8-1~deb12u1"}]}],"versions":["15.7-1","15.8-1~deb10u1","15.8-1~deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-40548.json"}},{"package":{"name":"shim","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/shim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"15.8-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-40548.json"}},{"package":{"name":"shim","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/shim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"15.8-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-40548.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-40548"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
