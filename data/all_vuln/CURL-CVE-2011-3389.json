  "details": "curl is vulnerable to a SSL CBC IV vulnerability when built to use OpenSSL for\nthe SSL/TLS layer.\n\nThis vulnerability has been identified (CVE-2011-3389 aka the \"BEAST\" attack)\nand is addressed by OpenSSL already as they have made a work-around to\nmitigate the problem. When doing so, they figured out that some servers did\nnot work with the work-around and offered a way to disable it.\n\nThe bit used to disable the workaround was then added to the generic\n`SSL_OP_ALL` bitmask that SSL clients may use to enable workarounds for better\ncompatibility with servers. libcurl uses the SSL_OP_ALL bitmask.\n\nWhile `SSL_OP_ALL` is documented to enable \"rather harmless\" workarounds, it\ndoes in this case effectively enable this security vulnerability again.",
