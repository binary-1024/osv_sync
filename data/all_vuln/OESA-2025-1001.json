This issue enables an untrusted or compromised guest to crash the hypervisor&apos;s vSwitch by forging Virtio descriptors to cause out-of-bounds reads. This flaw allows an attacker with a malicious VM using a virtio driver to cause the vhost-user side to crash by sending a packet with a Tx checksum offload request and an invalid csum_start offset.(CVE-2024-11614)",
