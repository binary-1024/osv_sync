The device uses the guest supplied stream number unchecked, which can lead to out-of-bounds access to the UASDevice->data3 and UASDevice->status3 fields. A malicious guest user could use this flaw to crash QEMU or potentially achieve code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process on the host.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"qemu","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/qemu?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:5.2+dfsg-11+deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["1:5.2+dfsg-11"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-3713.json"}},{"package":{"name":"qemu","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/qemu?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:6.1+dfsg-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-3713.json"}},{"package":{"name":"qemu","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/qemu?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:6.1+dfsg-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-3713.json"}},{"package":{"name":"qemu","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/qemu?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:6.1+dfsg-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-3713.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3713"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
