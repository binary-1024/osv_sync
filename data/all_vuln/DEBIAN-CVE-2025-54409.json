From versions 0.13 to 0.19.1, there is a null pointer dereference vulnerability in AIDE. An attacker can crash the program during report printing or database listing after setting extended file attributes with an empty attribute value or with a key containing a comma. A local user might exploit this to cause a local denial of service. This issue has been patched in version 0.19.2. A workaround involves removing xattrs group from rules matching files on affected file systems.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"aide","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/aide?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.17.3-4+deb11u3"}]}],"versions":["0.17.3-4","0.17.3-4+deb11u1","0.17.3-4+deb11u2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-54409.json"}},{"package":{"name":"aide","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/aide?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.18.3-1+deb12u4"}]}],"versions":["0.18.3-1","0.18.3-1+deb12u1","0.18.3-1+deb12u2","0.18.3-1+deb12u3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-54409.json"}},{"package":{"name":"aide","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/aide?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.19.1-2+deb13u1"}]}],"versions":["0.19.1-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-54409.json"}},{"package":{"name":"aide","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/aide?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.19.2-1"}]}],"versions":["0.19.1-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-54409.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-54409"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
