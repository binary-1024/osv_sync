{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-24038","published":"2026-01-22T03:39:06.216Z","modified":"2026-01-28T05:48:37.161759Z","aliases":["GHSA-hqpv-ff5v-3hwf"],"summary":"Horilla HR has 2FA Bypass through its OTP Handling Logic","details":"Horilla is a free and open source Human Resource Management System (HRMS). In version 1.4.0, the OTP handling logic has a flawed equality check that can be bypassed. When an OTP expires, the server returns None, and if an attacker omits the otp field from their POST request, the user-supplied OTP is also None, causing the comparison user_otp == otp to pass. This allows an attacker to bypass two-factor authentication entirely without ever providing a valid OTP. If administrative accounts are targeted, it could lead to compromise of sensitive HR data, manipulation of employee records, and further system-wide abuse. This issue has been fixed in version 1.5.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/horilla-opensource/horilla","events":[{"introduced":"aa1a288dd79f3c1c7c1a1cb037fcf4c790c1bb8c"},{"fixed":"a66f8b7ff4c49f39688f24485d228a295f640076"}]}],"versions":["1.4.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24038.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24038.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/horilla-opensource/horilla/releases/tag/1.5.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/horilla-opensource/horilla/security/advisories/GHSA-hqpv-ff5v-3hwf"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24038"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-287"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24038.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
