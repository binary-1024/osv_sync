{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-39899","published":"2025-10-01T08:15:32Z","modified":"2025-10-02T09:25:45.043810Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-39899"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/userfaultfd: fix kmap_local LIFO ordering for CONFIG_HIGHPTE  With CONFIG_HIGHPTE on 32-bit ARM, move_pages_pte() maps PTE pages using kmap_local_page(), which requires unmapping in Last-In-First-Out order.  The current code maps dst_pte first, then src_pte, but unmaps them in the same order (dst_pte, src_pte), violating the LIFO requirement.  This causes the warning in kunmap_local_indexed():    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 604 at mm/highmem.c:622 kunmap_local_indexed+0x178/0x17c   addr \\!= __fix_to_virt(FIX_KMAP_BEGIN + idx)  Fix this by reversing the unmap order to respect LIFO ordering.  This issue follows the same pattern as similar fixes: - commit eca6828403b8 (\"crypto: skcipher - fix mismatch between mapping and unmapping order\") - commit 8cf57c6df818 (\"nilfs2: eliminate staggered calls to kunmap in nilfs_rename\")  Both of which addressed the same fundamental requirement that kmap_local operations must follow LIFO ordering.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.48-1"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-39899.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.16.6-1"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.3-1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16.5-1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-39899.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-39899"}]}
