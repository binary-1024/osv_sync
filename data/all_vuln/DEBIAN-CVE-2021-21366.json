This may lead to unexpected syntactic changes during XML processing in some downstream applications. This is fixed in version 0.5.0. As a workaround downstream applications can validate the input and reject the maliciously crafted documents.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"node-xmldom","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-xmldom?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.5.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-21366.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-xmldom","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-xmldom?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.5.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-21366.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-xmldom","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-xmldom?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.5.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-21366.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-xmldom","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-xmldom?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.5.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-21366.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-21366"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
