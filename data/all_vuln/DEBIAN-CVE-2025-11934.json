For example when a client sends ECDSA P521 as the supported signature algorithm the server previously could respond as ECDSA P256 being the accepted signature algorithm and the connection would continue with using ECDSA P256, if the client supports ECDSA P256.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wolfssl","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/wolfssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.6.0+p1-0+deb11u1","4.6.0+p1-0+deb11u2","4.6.0-3","5.0.0-1","5.0.0-1~bpo11+1","5.1.1-1","5.1.1-1~bpo11+1","5.2.0-1","5.2.0-2","5.2.0-2~bpo11+1","5.5.3-1","5.5.3-2","5.5.3-3","5.5.3-3~bpo11+1","5.5.4-1","5.5.4-2","5.5.4-2.1","5.5.4-2~bpo11+1","5.6.4-1","5.6.4-2","5.6.6-1","5.6.6-1.1","5.6.6-1.2","5.6.6-1.3","5.6.6-1.3~exp1","5.7.0-0.1","5.7.0-0.2","5.7.0-0.3","5.7.2-0.1","5.7.2-0.2","5.7.2-0.3","5.7.2-0.4","5.8.2-1","5.8.2-1.1","5.8.2-1.2","5.8.4-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-11934.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wolfssl","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/wolfssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.5.4-2","5.5.4-2+deb12u1","5.5.4-2+deb12u2","5.5.4-2.1","5.6.4-1","5.6.4-2","5.6.6-1","5.6.6-1.1","5.6.6-1.2","5.6.6-1.3","5.6.6-1.3~exp1","5.7.0-0.1","5.7.0-0.2","5.7.0-0.3","5.7.2-0.1","5.7.2-0.2","5.7.2-0.3","5.7.2-0.4","5.8.2-1","5.8.2-1.1","5.8.2-1.2","5.8.4-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-11934.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wolfssl","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/wolfssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.7.2-0.1","5.7.2-0.1+deb13u1","5.7.2-0.2","5.7.2-0.3","5.7.2-0.4","5.8.2-1","5.8.2-1.1","5.8.2-1.2","5.8.4-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-11934.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wolfssl","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/wolfssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.7.2-0.1","5.7.2-0.2","5.7.2-0.3","5.7.2-0.4","5.8.2-1","5.8.2-1.1","5.8.2-1.2","5.8.4-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-11934.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-11934"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
