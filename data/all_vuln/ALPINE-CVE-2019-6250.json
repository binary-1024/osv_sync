A v2_decoder.cpp zmq::v2_decoder_t::size_ready integer overflow allows an authenticated attacker to overwrite an arbitrary amount of bytes beyond the bounds of a buffer, which can be leveraged to run arbitrary code on the target system. The memory layout allows the attacker to inject OS commands into a data structure located immediately after the problematic buffer (i.e., it is not necessary to use a typical buffer-overflow exploitation technique that changes the flow of control).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"zeromq","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/zeromq?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.3.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.10-r0","2.1.10-r0","2.1.11-r0","2.1.7-r0","2.1.7-r1","2.1.7-r2","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","3.2.2-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.3-r1","3.2.4-r0","4.0.4-r0","4.0.5-r0","4.1.1-r0","4.1.2-r0","4.1.3-r0","4.1.3-r1","4.1.3-r2","4.1.3-r3","4.1.4-r0","4.1.5-r0","4.1.5-r1","4.2.2-r0","4.2.2-r1","4.2.2-r2","4.2.3-r0","4.2.5-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-6250.json"}},{"package":{"name":"zeromq","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/zeromq?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.3.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.10-r0","2.1.10-r0","2.1.11-r0","2.1.7-r0","2.1.7-r1","2.1.7-r2","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","3.2.2-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.3-r1","3.2.4-r0","4.0.4-r0","4.0.5-r0","4.1.1-r0","4.1.2-r0","4.1.3-r0","4.1.3-r1","4.1.3-r2","4.1.3-r3","4.1.4-r0","4.1.5-r0","4.1.5-r1","4.2.2-r0","4.2.2-r1","4.2.2-r2","4.2.3-r0","4.2.5-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-6250.json"}},{"package":{"name":"zeromq","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/zeromq?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.3.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.10-r0","2.1.10-r0","2.1.11-r0","2.1.7-r0","2.1.7-r1","2.1.7-r2","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","3.2.2-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.3-r1","3.2.4-r0","4.0.4-r0","4.0.5-r0","4.1.1-r0","4.1.2-r0","4.1.3-r0","4.1.3-r1","4.1.3-r2","4.1.3-r3","4.1.4-r0","4.1.5-r0","4.1.5-r1","4.2.2-r0","4.2.2-r1","4.2.2-r2","4.2.3-r0","4.2.5-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-6250.json"}},{"package":{"name":"zeromq","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/zeromq?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.3.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.10-r0","2.1.10-r0","2.1.11-r0","2.1.7-r0","2.1.7-r1","2.1.7-r2","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","3.2.2-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.3-r1","3.2.4-r0","4.0.4-r0","4.0.5-r0","4.1.1-r0","4.1.2-r0","4.1.3-r0","4.1.3-r1","4.1.3-r2","4.1.3-r3","4.1.4-r0","4.1.5-r0","4.1.5-r1","4.2.2-r0","4.2.2-r1","4.2.2-r2","4.2.3-r0","4.2.5-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-6250.json"}},{"package":{"name":"zeromq","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/zeromq?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.3.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.10-r0","2.1.10-r0","2.1.11-r0","2.1.7-r0","2.1.7-r1","2.1.7-r2","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","3.2.2-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.3-r1","3.2.4-r0","4.0.4-r0","4.0.5-r0","4.1.1-r0","4.1.2-r0","4.1.3-r0","4.1.3-r1","4.1.3-r2","4.1.3-r3","4.1.4-r0","4.1.5-r0","4.1.5-r1","4.2.2-r0","4.2.2-r1","4.2.2-r2","4.2.3-r0","4.2.5-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-6250.json"}},{"package":{"name":"zeromq","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/zeromq?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.3.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.10-r0","2.1.10-r0","2.1.11-r0","2.1.7-r0","2.1.7-r1","2.1.7-r2","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","3.2.2-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.3-r1","3.2.4-r0","4.0.4-r0","4.0.5-r0","4.1.1-r0","4.1.2-r0","4.1.3-r0","4.1.3-r1","4.1.3-r2","4.1.3-r3","4.1.4-r0","4.1.5-r0","4.1.5-r1","4.2.2-r0","4.2.2-r1","4.2.2-r2","4.2.3-r0","4.2.5-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-6250.json"}},{"package":{"name":"zeromq","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/zeromq?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.3.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.10-r0","2.1.10-r0","2.1.11-r0","2.1.7-r0","2.1.7-r1","2.1.7-r2","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","3.2.2-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.3-r1","3.2.4-r0","4.0.4-r0","4.0.5-r0","4.1.1-r0","4.1.2-r0","4.1.3-r0","4.1.3-r1","4.1.3-r2","4.1.3-r3","4.1.4-r0","4.1.5-r0","4.1.5-r1","4.2.2-r0","4.2.2-r1","4.2.2-r2","4.2.3-r0","4.2.5-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-6250.json"}},{"package":{"name":"zeromq","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/zeromq?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.3.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.10-r0","2.1.10-r0","2.1.11-r0","2.1.7-r0","2.1.7-r1","2.1.7-r2","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","3.2.2-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.3-r1","3.2.4-r0","4.0.4-r0","4.0.5-r0","4.1.1-r0","4.1.2-r0","4.1.3-r0","4.1.3-r1","4.1.3-r2","4.1.3-r3","4.1.4-r0","4.1.5-r0","4.1.5-r1","4.2.2-r0","4.2.2-r1","4.2.2-r2","4.2.3-r0","4.2.5-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-6250.j
