The latest version of the TIFF specification\nis available on-line in several different formats.And contains command-line programs\nfor manipulating TIFF format image files using the libtiff library.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nLibTIFF is a library for reading and writing TIFF (label image file format) files that are open source. This library contains some command-line tools for handling TIFF files.\n There is a security vulnerability in the 4.6.0 version of LibTIFF, which originates from the dereference of the null pointer of the function PS_Lvl2page in the file tools/tiff2ps.c.(CVE-2025-8534)\n\nA vulnerability was found in LibTIFF up to 4.5.1 (Image Processing Software). It has been rated as critical.Using CWE to declare the problem leads to CWE-121. A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).Impacted is confidentiality, integrity, and availability.Applying the patch 8a7a48d7a645992ca83062b3a1873c951661e2b3 is able to eliminate this problem.
