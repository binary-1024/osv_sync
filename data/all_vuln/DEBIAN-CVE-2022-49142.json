{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49142","published":"2025-02-26T07:00:51Z","modified":"2025-10-16T09:03:39.567821Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-49142"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: preserve skb_end_offset() in skb_unclone_keeptruesize()  syzbot found another way to trigger the infamous WARN_ON_ONCE(delta < len) in skb_try_coalesce() [1]  I was able to root cause the issue to kfence.  When kfence is in action, the following assertion is no longer true:  int size = xxxx; void *ptr1 = kmalloc(size, gfp); void *ptr2 = kmalloc(size, gfp);  if (ptr1 && ptr2) \tASSERT(ksize(ptr1) == ksize(ptr2));  We attempted to fix these issues in the blamed commits, but forgot that TCP was possibly shifting data after skb_unclone_keeptruesize() has been used, notably from tcp_retrans_try_collapse().  So we not only need to keep same skb->truesize value, we also need to make sure TCP wont fill new tailroom that pskb_expand_head() was able to get from a addr = kmalloc(...) followed by ksize(addr)  Split skb_unclone_keeptruesize() into two parts:  1) Inline skb_unclone_keeptruesize() for the common case,    when skb is not cloned.  2) Out of line __skb_unclone_keeptruesize() for the 'slow path'.
