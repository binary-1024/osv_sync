Prior to versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2, working with large buffers in Lua scripts can lead to a stack overflow. Users of Lua rules and output scripts may be affected when working with large buffers. This includes a rule passing a large buffer to a Lua script. This issue has been patched in versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2. A workaround for this issue involves disabling Lua rules and output scripts, or making sure limits, such as stream.depth.reassembly and HTTP response body limits (response-body-limit), are set to less than half the stack size.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"suricata","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/suricata@3.0-1?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.8-1build1","2.0.9-1","2.0.10-1","2.0.10-2","2.0.11-1","3.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"suricata","binary_version":"3.0-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-64344.json"}},{"package":{"name":"suricata","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/suricata@3.2-2ubuntu3?arch=source&distro=bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.2-2ubuntu3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"libhtp-0.5.23-1","binary_version":"3.2-2ubuntu3"},{"binary_name":"suricata","binary_version":"3.2-2ubuntu3"},{"binary_name":"suricata-hyperscan","binary_version":"3.2-2ubuntu3"},{"binary_name":"suricata-oinkmaster","binary_version":"3.2-2ubuntu3"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-64344.json"}},{"package":{"name":"suricata","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:22.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/suricata@1:6.0.4-3?arch=source&distro=jammy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:6.0.4-2","1:6.0.4-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"suricata","binary_version":"1:6.0.4-3"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-64344.json"}},{"package":{"name":"suricata","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/suricata@1:7.0.3-1build3?arch=source&distro=noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:7.0.0-2","1:7.0.2-1","1:7.0.2-1build1","1:7.0.3-1build1","1:7.0.3-1build3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"suricata","binary_version":"1:7.0.3-1build3"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-64344.json"}},{"package":{"name":"suricata","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.10","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/suricata@1:7.0.10-1?arch=source&distro=questing"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:7.0.8-2","1:7.0.10-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"suricata","binary_version":"1:7.0.10-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-64344.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-64344"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64344"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-93fh-cgmc-w3rx"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/8065"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/e13fe6a90dba210a478148c4084f6f5db17c5b5a"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
