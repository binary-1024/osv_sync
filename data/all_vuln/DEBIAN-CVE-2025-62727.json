Starting in version 0.39.0 and prior to version 0.49.1 , an unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted HTTP Range header that triggers quadratic-time processing in Starlette's FileResponse Range parsing/merging logic. This enables CPU exhaustion per request, causing denial‑of‑service for endpoints serving files (e.g., StaticFiles or any use of FileResponse). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.49.1.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"starlette","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/starlette?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.14.1-1","0.16.0-1","0.18.0-1","0.20.4-1","0.23.1-1","0.24.0-1","0.25.0-1","0.25.0-2","0.26.1-1","0.28.0-1","0.30.0-1","0.31.1-1","0.37.2-1","0.38.2-1","0.39.1-1","0.39.2-1","0.41.0-1","0.41.2-1","0.41.3-1","0.41.3-2","0.46.1-1","0.46.1-2","0.46.1-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-62727.json"}},{"package":{"name":"starlette","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/starlette?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.26.1-1","0.28.0-1","0.30.0-1","0.31.1-1","0.37.2-1","0.38.2-1","0.39.1-1","0.39.2-1","0.41.0-1","0.41.2-1","0.41.3-1","0.41.3-2","0.46.1-1","0.46.1-2","0.46.1-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-62727.json"}},{"package":{"name":"starlette","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/starlette?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.46.1-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-62727.json"}},{"package":{"name":"starlette","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/starlette?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.46.1-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-62727.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-62727"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
