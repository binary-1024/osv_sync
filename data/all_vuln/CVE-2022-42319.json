This memory is freed only after the request has been finished completely. A request is regarded to be finished only after the guest has read the response message of the request from the ring page. Thus a guest not reading the response can cause xenstored to not free the temporary memory. This can result in memory shortages causing Denial of Service (DoS) of xenstored.","references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/01/6"},{"type":"FIX","url":"http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-416.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-07"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5272"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-416.txt"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YTMITQBGC23MSDHUCAPCVGLMVXIBXQTQ/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YZVXG7OOOXCX6VIPEMLFDPIPUTFAYWPE/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZLI2NPNEH7CNJO3VZGQNOI4M4EWLNKPZ/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
