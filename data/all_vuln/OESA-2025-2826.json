RFC 3986 permits IPv6 addresses to be included within the host component, enclosed within square brackets. For example: &quot;http://[::1]/&quot;. IPv4 addresses and hostnames must not appear within square brackets. Parse did not enforce this requirement.(CVE-2025-47912)\n\nDespite HTTP headers having a default limit of 1MB, the number of cookies that can be parsed does not have a limit. By sending a lot of very small cookies such as &quot;a=;&quot;, an attacker can make an HTTP server allocate a large amount of structs, causing large memory consumption.(CVE-2025-58186)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"golang","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/golang&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.17.3-45.oe2203sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["golang-1.17.3-45.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["golang-devel-1.17.3-45.oe2203sp4.noarch.rpm","golang-help-1.17.3-45.oe2203sp4.noarch.rpm"],"src":["golang-1.17.3-45.oe2203sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["golang-1.17.3-45.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2826.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2826"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47912"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-58186"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
