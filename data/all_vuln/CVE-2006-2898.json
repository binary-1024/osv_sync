{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2006-2898","published":"2006-06-07T10:02:00Z","modified":"2025-08-09T19:01:28Z","details":"The IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) for Asterisk 1.2.x before 1.2.9 and 1.0.x before 1.0.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and execute arbitrary code via truncated IAX 2 (IAX2) video frames, which bypasses a length check and leads to a buffer overflow involving negative length check.  NOTE: the vendor advisory claims that only a DoS is possible, but the original researcher is reliable.","references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"http://secunia.com/advisories/20497"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://secunia.com/advisories/20658"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://secunia.com/advisories/20899"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://secunia.com/advisories/21222"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.debian.org/security/2006/dsa-1126"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.novell.com/linux/security/advisories/2006_38_security.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2006/2181"},{"type":"FIX","url":"http://securitytracker.com/id?1016236"},{"type":"FIX","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/18295"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.asterisk.org/node/95"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-200606-15.xml"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/436127/100/0/threaded"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/436671/100/0/threaded"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/27045"}]}
