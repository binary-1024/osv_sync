An application is vulnerable if it reads pyfory serialized data from untrusted sources. An attacker can craft a data stream that selects pickle-fallback serializer during deserialization, leading to the execution of `pickle.loads`, which is vulnerable to remote code execution.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to pyfory version 0.12.3 or later, which has removed pickle fallback serializer and thus fixes this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/fory","events":[{"introduced":"7e6db1e97811b1cc95c9b8f5088e2abebe7f299a"},{"last_affected":"2e3dc3a432dffe6e1715b8d26f7d10ebc14bbbb6"},{"introduced":"d59c458dce25f0c0c363104c1d07a3533cdfb00a"},{"last_affected":"a48e9032dfbcc6020883d9eba072647626ff4975"}]}],"versions":["v0.12.0","v0.12.0-rc1","v0.12.1","v0.12.1-rc1","v0.12.2","v0.12.2-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-61622.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/vfn9hp9qt06db5yo1gmj3l114o3o2csd"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/09/29/3"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
