Prior to 7.18.0, the MCP server generation logic relies on string manipulation that incorporates the summary field from the OpenAPI specification without proper validation or escaping. This allows an attacker to \"break out\" of the string literal and inject arbitrary code. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.18.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/orval-labs/orval","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0eaab4d5a59bbe688f87b785bc1e47fa5cc1f719"}]}],"versions":["v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.0.6","v2.0.7","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v2.5.2","v2.5.3","v2.5.4","v2.5.5","v2.5.6","v2.5.7","v2.5.8","v2.5.9","v2.6.0","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.1.2","v3.1.3","v3.1.4","v3.1.5","v3.1.6","v3.1.7","v3.1.8","v3.1.9","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.2.2","v3.2.3","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.0.3","v4.1.0","v4.2.0","v4.2.1","v5.0.0","v5.1.0","v5.1.1","v5.1.2","v5.1.3","v5.1.4","v5.2.0","v5.3.0","v5.3.1","v5.3.2","v5.4.0","v5.4.1","v5.4.10","v5.4.11","v5.4.12","v5.4.13","v5.4.14","v5.4.2","v5.4.3","v5.4.4","v5.4.5","v5.4.6","v5.4.7","v5.4.8","v5.4.9","v5.5.0","v5.5.1","v5.5.10","v5.5.2","v5.5.3","v5.5.4","v5.5.5","v5.5.6","v5.5.7","v5.5.8","v5.5.9","v6.0.0","v6.0.1","v6.0.2","v6.0.3","v6.0.4","v6.1.0","v6.1.1","v6.1.2","v6.10.2","v6.10.3","v6.11.0","v6.11.1","v6.12.0","v6.12.1","v6.13.0","v6.13.1","v6.14.0","v6.14.1","v6.14.2","v6.14.3","v6.14.4","v6.15.0","v6.16.0","v6.17.0","v6.18.0","v6.18.1","v6.19.0","v6.19.1","v6.2.0","v6.2.1","v6.2.2","v6.2.3","v6.2.4","v6.20.0","v6.21.0","v6.22.0","v6.22.1","v6.23.0","v6.24.0","v6.25.0","v6.26.0","v6.27.0","v6.27.1","v6.28.0","v6.28.1","v6.28.2","v6.29.0","v6.29.1","v6.3.0","v6.30.0","v6.30.1","v6.30.2","v6.31.0","v6.4.0","v6.4.1","v6.4.2","v6.4.3","v6.5.0","v6.5.1","v6.5.2","v6.5.3","v6.6.0","v6.6.1","v6.6.2","v6.6.3","v6.6.4","v6.7.0","v6.7.1","v6.8.0","v6.8.1","v6.9.0","v6.9.1","v6.9.2","v6.9.3","v6.9.4","v6.9.5","v6.9.6","v7.0.0","v7.0.1","v7.1.0","v7.1.1","v7.10.0","v7.11.0","v7.11.1","v7.11.2","v7.12.0","v7.12.1","v7.12.2","v7.13.0","v7.13.1","v7.13.2","v7.14.0","v7.15.0","v7.16.0","v7.16.1","v7.17.0","v7.17.2","v7.2.0","v7.3.0","v7.4.0","v7.4.1","v7.5.0","v7.6.0","v7.7.0","v7.8.0","v7.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22785.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22785.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/orval-labs/orval/commit/80b5fe73b94f120a3a5561952d6d4b0f8d7e928d"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/orval-labs/orval/security/advisories/GHSA-mwr6-3gp8-9jmj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22785"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-77"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22785.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
