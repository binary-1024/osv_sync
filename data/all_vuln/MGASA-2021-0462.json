  "details": "OpenDMARC through 1.3.2 and 1.4.x, when used with pypolicyd-spf 2.0.2, allows\nattacks that bypass SPF and DMARC authentication in situations where the HELO\nfield is inconsistent with the MAIL FROM field (CVE-2019-20790).\n\nOpenDMARC through 1.3.2 and 1.4.x allows attacks that inject authentication\nresults to provide false information about the domain that originated an e-mail\nmessage. This is caused by incorrect parsing and interpretation of SPF/DKIM\nauthentication results, as demonstrated by the example.net(.example.com\nsubstring (CVE-2020-12272).\n\nOpenDMARC through 1.3.2 and 1.4.x through 1.4.0-Beta1 has improper null\ntermination in the function opendmarc_xml_parse that can result in a one-byte\nheap overflow in opendmarc_xml when parsing a specially crafted DMARC aggregate\nreport. This can cause remote memory corruption when a '\\0' byte overwrites the\nheap metadata of the next chunk and its PREV_INUSE flag (CVE-2020-12460).\n",
