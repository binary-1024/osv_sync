{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68298","published":"2025-12-16T16:16:08.760Z","modified":"2026-01-10T14:08:05.812598Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-68298"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: btusb: mediatek: Avoid btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf() NULL deref  In btusb_mtk_setup(), we set `btmtk_data->isopkt_intf` to:   usb_ifnum_to_if(data->udev, MTK_ISO_IFNUM)  That function can return NULL in some cases. Even when it returns NULL, though, we still go on to call btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf().  As of commit e9087e828827 (\"Bluetooth: btusb: mediatek: Add locks for usb_driver_claim_interface()\"), calling btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf() when `btmtk_data->isopkt_intf` is NULL will cause a crash because we'll end up passing a bad pointer to device_lock(). Prior to that commit we'd pass the NULL pointer directly to usb_driver_claim_interface() which would detect it and return an error, which was handled.  Resolve the crash in btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf() by adding a NULL check at the start of the function. This makes the code handle a NULL `btmtk_data->isopkt_intf` the same way it did before the problematic commit (just with a slight change to the error message printed).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.63-1"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.57-1","6.12.57-1~bpo12+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68298.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.17.11-1"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.57-1","6.12.57-1~bpo12+1","6.12.63-1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.10-1","6.16.11-1","6.16.12-1","6.16.12-1~bpo13+1","6.16.12-2","6.16.3-1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16.5-1","6.16.6-1","6.16.7-1","6.16.8-1","6.16.9-1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1","6.17.10-1","6.17.2-1~exp1","6.17.5-1~exp1","6.17.6-1","6.17.7-1","6.17.7-2","6.17.8-1","6.17.8-1~bpo13+1","6.17.9-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68298.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-68298"}]}
