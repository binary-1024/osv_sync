However, it's important to note that access to the analytical data of these charts and dashboards would still be subject to validation based on data access privileges.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Superset: before 3.0.4, from 3.1.0 before 3.1.1.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.1.1, which fixes the issue.",
