  "details": "Updated python-waitress packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nIf a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same\nway as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the\nback-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways.\nThis can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby\nWaitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a\nsingle HTTP message (CVE-2019-16785).\n\nWaitress through version 1.3.1 would parse the Transfer-Encoding header\nand only look for a single string value, if that value was not chunked\nit would fall through and use the Content-Length header instead. This\ncould allow for Waitress to treat a single request as multiple requests\nin the case of HTTP pipelining (CVE-2019-16786).\n\nIn Waitress through version 1.4.0, if a proxy server is used in front of\nwaitress, an invalid request may be sent by an attacker that bypasses the\nfront-end and is parsed differently by waitress leading to a potential for\nHTTP request smuggling. If a front-end server does HTTP pipelining to a\nbackend Waitress server this could lead to HTTP request splitting which\nmay lead to potential cache poisoning or unexpected information disclosure\n(CVE-2019-16789).\n",
