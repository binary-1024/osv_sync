  "details": "The updated packages fix security vulnerabilities:\nA vulnerability was found in GnuTLS, where a cockpit (which uses gnuTLS)\nrejects a certificate chain with distributed trust. This issue occurs\nwhen validating a certificate chain with cockpit-certificate-ensure.\nThis flaw allows an unauthenticated, remote client or attacker to\ninitiate a denial of service attack. (CVE-2024-0567)\nA vulnerability was found in GnuTLS. The response times to malformed\nciphertexts in RSA-PSK ClientKeyExchange differ from response times of\nciphertexts with correct PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. This issue may allow a\nremote attacker to perform a timing side-channel attack in the RSA-PSK\nkey exchange, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive data.\nCVE-2024-0553 is designated as an incomplete resolution for\nCVE-2023-5981. (CVE-2024-0553)\n",
