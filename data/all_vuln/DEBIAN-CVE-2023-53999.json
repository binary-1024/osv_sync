It's possible to trigger memleak when the rule forwards packets from internal port and over tunnel, in the case that, for example, CT 'new' state offload is allowed. As int_port object is assigned to the flow attribute of post_act rule, and its refcnt is incremented by mlx5e_tc_int_port_get(), but mlx5e_tc_int_port_put() is not called, the refcnt is never decremented, then int_port is never freed.  The kmemleak reports the following error: unreferenced object 0xffff888128204b80 (size 64):   comm \"handler20\", pid 50121, jiffies 4296973009 (age 642.932s)   hex dump (first 32 bytes):     01 00 00
