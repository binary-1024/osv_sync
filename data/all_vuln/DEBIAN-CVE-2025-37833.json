{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-37833","published":"2025-05-08T07:15:54Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:20:29.374878Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-37833"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/niu: Niu requires MSIX ENTRY_DATA fields touch before entry reads  Fix niu_try_msix() to not cause a fatal trap on sparc systems.  Set PCI_DEV_FLAGS_MSIX_TOUCH_ENTRY_DATA_FIRST on the struct pci_dev to work around a bug in the hardware or firmware.  For each vector entry in the msix table, niu chips will cause a fatal trap if any registers in that entry are read before that entries' ENTRY_DATA register is written to. Testing indicates writes to other registers are not sufficient to prevent the fatal trap, however the value does not appear to matter. This only needs to happen once after power up, so simply rebooting into a kernel lacking this fix will NOT cause the trap.
