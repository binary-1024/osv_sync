A high level facade is supplied that simplifies common use cases. Custom objects can be serialized without need for specifying mappings. Speed and low memory footprint are a crucial part of the design, making it suitable for large object graphs or systems with high message throughput. No information is duplicated that can be obtained via reflection. This results in XML that is easier to read for humans and more compact than native Java serialization. XStream serializes internal fields, including private and final. Supports non-public and inner classes. Classes are not required to have default constructor. Duplicate references encountered in the object-model will be maintained. Supports circular references. By implementing an interface, XStream can serialize directly to/from any tree structure (not just XML). Strategies can be registered allowing customization of how particular types are represented as XML. When an exception occurs due to malformed XML, detailed diagnostics are provided to help isolate and fix the problem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\\r\\n\\r\\n\r\nXStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream before version 1.4.15, a Server-Side Forgery Request vulnerability can be activated when unmarshalling. The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to request data from internal resources that are not publicly available only by manipulating the processed input stream. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.15. The reported vulnerability does not exist if running Java 15 or higher. No user is affected who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's Security Framework with a whitelist! Anyone relying on XStream's default blacklist can immediately switch to a whilelist for the allowed types to avoid the vulnerability. Users of XStream 1.4.14 or below who still want to use XStream default blacklist can use a workaround described in more detailed in the referenced advisories.(CVE-2020-26258)\\r\\n\\r\\n\r\nXStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream before version 1.4.15, is vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Deletion on the local host when unmarshalling. The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to delete arbitrary know files on the host as log as the executing process has sufficient rights only by manipulating the processed input stream.
