{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49687","published":"2025-02-26T07:01:43Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:18:37.329561Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-49687"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  virtio_net: fix xdp_rxq_info bug after suspend/resume  The following sequence currently causes a driver bug warning when using virtio_net:    # ip link set eth0 up   # echo mem > /sys/power/state (or e.g. # rtcwake -s 10 -m mem)   <resume>   # ip link set eth0 down    Missing register, driver bug   WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 375 at net/core/xdp.c:138 xdp_rxq_info_unreg+0x58/0x60   Call trace:    xdp_rxq_info_unreg+0x58/0x60    virtnet_close+0x58/0xac    __dev_close_many+0xac/0x140    __dev_change_flags+0xd8/0x210    dev_change_flags+0x24/0x64    do_setlink+0x230/0xdd0    ...  This happens because virtnet_freeze() frees the receive_queue completely (including struct xdp_rxq_info) but does not call xdp_rxq_info_unreg(). Similarly, virtnet_restore() sets up the receive_queue again but does not call xdp_rxq_info_reg().  Actually, parts of virtnet_freeze_down() and virtnet_restore_up() are almost identical to virtnet_close() and virtnet_open(): only the calls to xdp_rxq_info_(un)reg() are missing. This means that we can fix this easily and avoid such problems in the future by just calling virtnet_close()/open() from the freeze/restore handlers.  Aside from adding the missing xdp_rxq_info calls the only difference is that the refill work is only cancelled if netif_running(). However, this should not make any functional difference since the refill work should only be active if the network interface is actually up.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.127-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.103-1","5.10.103-1~bpo10+1","5.10.106-1","5.10.113-1","5.10.120-1","5.10.120-1~bpo10+1","5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1","5.10.92-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49687.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.14-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49687.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.14-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49687.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.14-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49687.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-49687"}]}
