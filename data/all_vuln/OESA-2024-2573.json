  "details": "gRPC is a modern open source high performance RPC framework that can run in any environment. It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication. It is also applicable in last mile of distributed computing to connect devices, mobile applications and browsers to backend services.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nThere exists a denial of service through Data corruption in gRPC-C++ -\u00a0gRPC-C++ servers with transmit zero copy enabled through the channel arg GRPC_ARG_TCP_TX_ZEROCOPY_ENABLED can experience data corruption issues. The data sent by the application may be corrupted before transmission over the network thus leading the receiver to receive an incorrect set of bytes causing RPC requests to fail.
