In Sourcegraph versions before 3.41.0, it is possible for an attacker to delete other users’ saved searches due to a bug in the authorization check. The vulnerability does not allow the reading of other users’ saved searches, only overwriting them with attacker-controlled searches. The issue is patched in Sourcegraph version 3.41.0. There is no workaround for this issue and updating to a secure version is highly recommended.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31155.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.41.0"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/security/advisories/GHSA-37qp-9jq6-f6mx"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/commit/2832d7882396a6295ba5803b5ef48dc7d5a24c59"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
