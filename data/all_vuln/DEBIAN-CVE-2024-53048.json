Intel provides the reference design, but it is up to vendor on the final product design. For some cases, like Linux DPLL support, the static values defined in the driver does not reflect the actual LOM design. Current implementation of dpll pins is causing the crash on probe of the ice driver for such DPLL enabled E810 LOM designs:  WARNING: (...) at drivers/dpll/dpll_core.c:495 dpll_pin_get+0x2c4/0x330 ...

The number of dpll pins enabled by LOM vendor is greater than expected and defined in the driver for Intel designed NICs, which causes the crash.  Prevent the crash and allow generic pin initialization within Linux DPLL subsystem for DPLL enabled E810 LOM designs.  Newly designed solution for described issue will be based on \"per HW design\" pin initialization. It requires pin information dynamically acquired from the firmware and is already in progress, planned for next-tree only.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.11.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-53048.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.11.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-53048.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-53048"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
