The session id is generated from a (usually SHA-1) hash of a simple counter, the epoch time, the built-in rand function, the PID and the current Catalyst context. This information is of low entropy. The PID will come from a small set of numbers, and the epoch time may be guessed, if it is not leaked from the HTTP Date header. The built-in rand function is unsuitable for cryptographic usage.  Predicable session ids could allow an attacker to gain access to systems.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libcatalyst-plugin-session-perl","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libcatalyst-plugin-session-perl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.41-1","0.43-1","0.44-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-40924.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libcatalyst-plugin-session-perl","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libcatalyst-plugin-session-perl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.43-1","0.44-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-40924.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libcatalyst-plugin-session-perl","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libcatalyst-plugin-session-perl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.43-1","0.44-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-40924.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libcatalyst-plugin-session-perl","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libcatalyst-plugin-session-perl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.44-1"}]}],"versions":["0.43-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-40924.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-40924"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
