{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-3341","published":"2023-09-20T13:15:11Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:17:44.760392Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-3341"],"details":"The code that processes control channel messages sent to `named` calls certain functions recursively during packet parsing. Recursion depth is only limited by the maximum accepted packet size; depending on the environment, this may cause the packet-parsing code to run out of available stack memory, causing `named` to terminate unexpectedly. Since each incoming control channel message is fully parsed before its contents are authenticated, exploiting this flaw does not require the attacker to hold a valid RNDC key; only network access to the control channel's configured TCP port is necessary.
