{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2017-11565","published":"2017-07-23T20:29:00Z","modified":"2025-08-09T19:01:27Z","details":"debian/tor.init in the Debian tor_0.2.9.11-1~deb9u1 package for Tor was designed to execute aa-exec from the standard system pathname if the apparmor package is installed, but implements this incorrectly (with a wrong assumption that the specific pathname would remain the same forever), which allows attackers to bypass intended AppArmor restrictions by leveraging the silent loss of this protection mechanism. NOTE: this does not affect systems, such as default Debian stretch installations, on which Tor startup relies on a systemd unit file (instead of this tor.init script).","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99933"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugs.debian.org/869153"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
