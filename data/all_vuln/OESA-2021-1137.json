Hibernate lets you develop persistent objects following common Java idiom - including association, inheritance, polymorphism, composition and the Java collections framework. Extremely fine-grained, richly typed object models are possible. The Hibernate Query Language, designed as a &quot;minimal&quot; object-oriented extension to SQL, provides an elegant bridge between the object and relational worlds. Hibernate is now the most popular ORM solution for Java.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in Hibernate ORM in versions before 5.3.18, 5.4.18 and 5.5.0.Beta1. A SQL injection in the implementation of the JPA Criteria API can permit unsanitized literals when a literal is used in the SELECT or GROUP BY parts of the query. This flaw could allow an attacker to access unauthorized information or possibly conduct further attacks.(CVE-2019-14900)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"hibernate4","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/hibernate4&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.3.11-3.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"noarch":["hibernate4-osgi-4.3.11-3.oe1.noarch.rpm","hibernate4-javadoc-4.3.11-3.oe1.noarch.rpm","hibernate4-testing-4.3.11-3.oe1.noarch.rpm","hibernate4-core-4.3.11-3.oe1.noarch.rpm","hibernate4-hikaricp-4.3.11-3.oe1.noarch.rpm","hibernate4-proxool-4.3.11-3.oe1.noarch.rpm","hibernate4-ehcache-4.3.11-3.oe1.noarch.rpm","hibernate4-parent-4.3.11-3.oe1.noarch.rpm","hibernate4-infinispan-4.3.11-3.oe1.noarch.rpm","hibernate4-envers-4.3.11-3.oe1.noarch.rpm","hibernate4-entitymanager-4.3.11-3.oe1.noarch.rpm","hibernate4-c3p0-4.3.11-3.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["hibernate4-4.3.11-3.oe1.src.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1137.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1137"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14900"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
