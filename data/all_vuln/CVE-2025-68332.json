{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68332","published":"2025-12-22T16:14:10.146Z","modified":"2026-01-11T20:45:59.814361Z","summary":"comedi: c6xdigio: Fix invalid PNP driver unregistration","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: c6xdigio: Fix invalid PNP driver unregistration\n\nThe Comedi low-level driver \"c6xdigio\" seems to be for a parallel port\nconnected device.  When the Comedi core calls the driver's Comedi\n\"attach\" handler `c6xdigio_attach()` to configure a Comedi to use this\ndriver, it tries to enable the parallel port PNP resources by\nregistering a PNP driver with `pnp_register_driver()`, but ignores the\nreturn value.  (The `struct pnp_driver` it uses has only the `name` and\n`id_table` members filled in.)  The driver's Comedi \"detach\" handler\n`c6xdigio_detach()` unconditionally unregisters the PNP driver with\n`pnp_unregister_driver()`.\n\nIt is possible for `c6xdigio_attach()` to return an error before it\ncalls `pnp_register_driver()` and it is possible for the call to\n`pnp_register_driver()` to return an error (that is ignored).  In both\ncases, the driver should not be calling `pnp_unregister_driver()` as it\ndoes in `c6xdigio_detach()`.  (Note that `c6xdigio_detach()` will be\ncalled by the Comedi core if `c6xdigio_attach()` returns an error, or if\nthe Comedi core decides to detach the Comedi device from the driver for\nsome other reason.)\n\nThe unconditional call to `pnp_unregister_driver()` without a previous\nsuccessful call to `pnp_register_driver()` will cause\n`driver_unregister()` to issue a warning \"Unexpected driver\nunregister!\".  This was detected by Syzbot [1].\n\nAlso, the PNP driver registration and unregistration should be done at\nmodule init and exit time, respectively, not when attaching or detaching\nComedi devices to the driver.  (There might be more than one Comedi\ndevice being attached to the driver, although that is unlikely.)\n\nChange the driver to do the PNP driver registration at module init time,\nand the unregistration at module exit time.  Since `c6xdigio_detach()`\nnow only calls `comedi_legacy_detach()`, remove the function and change\nthe Comedi driver \"detach\" handler to `comedi_legacy_detach`.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n[1] Syzbot sample crash report:\nUnexpected driver unregister!\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5970 at drivers/base/driver.c:273
