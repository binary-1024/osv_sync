  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: btintel: Check dsbr size from EFI variable\n\nSince the size of struct btintel_dsbr is already known, we can just\nstart there instead of querying the EFI variable size. If the final\nresult doesn't match what we expect also fail. This fixes a stack buffer\noverflow when the EFI variable is larger than struct btintel_dsbr.",
