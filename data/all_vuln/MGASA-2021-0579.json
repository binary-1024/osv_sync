  "details": "Bundler sometimes chooses a dependency source based on the highest gem\nversion number, which means that a rogue gem found at a public source\nmay be chosen, even if the intended choice was a private gem that is a\ndependency of another private gem that is explicitly depended on by the\napplication. (CVE-2020-36327)\n\nThe REXML gem does not properly address XML round-trip issues. An\nincorrect document can be produced after parsing and serializing.\n(CVE-2021-28965)\n\nIn RDoc it is possible to execute arbitrary code via | and tags in a\nfilename. (CVE-2021-31799)\n\nA malicious FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP into\nconnecting back to a given IP address and port. This potentially makes\ncurl extract information about services that are otherwise private and not\ndisclosed (e.g., the attacker can conduct port scans and service banner\nextractions).  (CVE-2021-31810)\n\nRuby Net::IMAP does not raise an exception when StartTLS fails with an an\nunknown response, which might allow man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass\nthe TLS protections by leveraging a network position between the client\nand the registry to block the StartTLS command, aka a \"StartTLS stripping\nattack.\" (CVE-2021-32066)\n\nBuffer Overrun in CGI.escape_html (CVE-2021-41816)\n\nRegular Expression Denial of Service Vulnerability of Date Parsing Methods\n(CVE-2021-41817)\n\nCookie Prefix Spoofing in CGI::Cookie.parse (CVE-2021-41819)\n",
