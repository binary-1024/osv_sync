A vulnerability was discovered in Gakido prior to version 0.1.1 that allowed HTTP header injection through CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) sequences in user-supplied header values and names. When making HTTP requests with user-controlled header values containing `\\r\\n` (CRLF), `\\n` (LF), or `\\x00` (null byte) characters, an attacker could inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the request. The fix in version 0.1.1 adds a `_sanitize_header()` function that strips `\\r`, `\\n`, and `\\x00` characters from both header names and values before they are included in HTTP requests.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/happyhackingspace/gakido","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f8db15843ce7c5e21e3bba3114fedeb580b5515f"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24489.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24489.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/HappyHackingSpace/gakido/commit/369c67e67c63da510c8a9ab021e54a92ccf1f788"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/HappyHackingSpace/gakido/releases/tag/v0.1.1-1bc6019"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/HappyHackingSpace/gakido/security/advisories/GHSA-gcgx-chcp-hxp9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24489"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-113","CWE-93"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24489.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
