When XSLT functions, such as the key() process, result in tree fragments, this corruption prevents the proper cleanup of ID attributes. As a result, the system may access freed memory, causing crashes or enabling attackers to trigger heap corruption.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:12447"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:12450"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:13267"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:13308"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:13309"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:13310"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:13311"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:13312"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:13313"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:13314"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:13335"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:13464"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:13622"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:14059"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:14396"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:14818"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:14819"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:14853"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:14858"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:15308"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:15672"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:15827"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:15828"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2379274"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxslt/-/issues/140"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-7425"}]}
