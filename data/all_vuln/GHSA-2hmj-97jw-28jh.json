  "details": "Improper permission checks in the AdminServer allow an authenticated client with insufficient privileges to invoke the `snapshot` and `restore` commands. The intended requirement is authentication and authorization on the root path (`/`) with **ALL** permission for these operations; however, affected versions permit invocation without that level of authorization. The primary risk is disclosure of cluster state via snapshots to a lesser-privileged client.\n\n*   **Affected:** `org.apache.zookeeper:zookeeper` 3.9.0 through 3.9.3.\n*   **Fixed:** 3.9.4 (ZOOKEEPER-4964 \u201ccheck permissions individually during admin server auth\u201d).\n*   **Mitigations:**\n    *   Disable both commands (`admin.snapshot.enabled`, `admin.restore.enabled`).\n    *   Disable AdminServer (`admin.enableServer`).\n    *   Ensure the root ACL is not open; note that ZooKeeper ACLs are not recursive.\n    *   Upgrade to 3.9.4.",
