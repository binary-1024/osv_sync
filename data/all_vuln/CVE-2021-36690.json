NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of this report because a sqlite3.exe user already has full privileges (e.g., is intentionally allowed to execute commands). This report does NOT imply any problem in the SQLite library.","references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Oct/28"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Oct/39"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Oct/41"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Oct/47"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Oct/49"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213446"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213486"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213487"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213488"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/718c0a8d17"}],"database_specific":{"isDisputed":true},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
