This may cause errors if we want to enable kernel preemption and remove dependency from patching code with stop_machine(). For example, if a task was switched out on auipc. And, if we changed the ftrace function before it was switched back, then it would jump to an address that has updated 11:0 bits mixing with previous XLEN:12 part.  p: patched area performed by dynamic ftrace ftrace_prologue: p|      REG_S   ra, -SZREG(sp) p|      auipc   ra, 0x? ------------> preempted \t\t\t\t\t... \t\t\t\tchange ftrace function \t\t\t\t\t... p|      jalr    -?(ra) <------------- switched back p|      REG_L   ra, -SZREG(sp) func: \txxx \tret","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.25-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53694.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.25-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53694.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.25-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53694.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-53694"}]}
