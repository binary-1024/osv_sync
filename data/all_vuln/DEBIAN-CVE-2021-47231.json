The problem was in unfreed usb_coherent.  In mcba_usb_start() 20 coherent buffers are allocated and there is nothing, that frees them:  1) In callback function the urb is resubmitted and that's all 2) In disconnect function urbs are simply killed, but URB_FREE_BUFFER    is not set (see mcba_usb_start) and this flag cannot be used with    coherent buffers.
