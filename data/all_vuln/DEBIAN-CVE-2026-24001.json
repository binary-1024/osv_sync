{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2026-24001","published":"2026-01-22T03:15:47.627Z","modified":"2026-01-22T22:15:50.966927Z","details":"jsdiff is a JavaScript text differencing implementation. Prior to versions 8.0.3, 5.2.2, and 4.0.4, attempting to parse a patch whose filename headers contain the line break characters `\\r`, `\\u2028`, or `\\u2029` can cause the `parsePatch` method to enter an infinite loop. It then consumes memory without limit until the process crashes due to running out of memory. Applications are therefore likely to be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack if they call `parsePatch` with a user-provided patch as input. A large payload is not needed to trigger the vulnerability, so size limits on user input do not provide any protection. Furthermore, some applications may be vulnerable even when calling `parsePatch` on a patch generated by the application itself if the user is nonetheless able to control the filename headers (e.g. by directly providing the filenames of the files to be diffed). The `applyPatch` method is similarly affected if (and only if) called with a string representation of a patch as an argument, since under the hood it parses that string using `parsePatch`. Other methods of the library are unaffected. Finally, a second and lesser interdependent bug - a ReDOS - also exhibits when those same line break characters are present in a patch's *patch* header (also known as its \"leading garbage\"). A maliciously-crafted patch header of length *n* can take `parsePatch` O(*n*³) time to parse. Versions 8.0.3, 5.2.2, and 4.0.4 contain a fix. As a workaround, do not attempt to parse patches that contain any of these characters: `\\r`, `\\u2028`, or `\\u2029`.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"node-diff","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-diff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.0.2~dfsg-2","5.0.0~dfsg+~5.0.1-1","5.0.0~dfsg+~5.0.1-2","5.0.0~dfsg+~5.0.1-3","5.0.0~dfsg+~5.0.1-4","5.0.0~dfsg+~5.0.1-5","5.0.0~dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-24001.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-diff","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-diff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.0.0~dfsg+~5.0.1-4","5.0.0~dfsg+~5.0.1-5"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-24001.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-diff","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-diff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.0.0~dfsg+~5.0.1-4","5.0.0~dfsg+~5.0.1-5"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-24001.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-diff","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-diff?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.0.0~dfsg+~5.0.1-4","5.0.0~dfsg+~5.0.1-5"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-24001.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2026-24001"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
