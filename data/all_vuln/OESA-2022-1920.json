The compositor can be a standalone display server running on Linux kernel modesetting and evdev input devices, an X application, or a wayland client itself. The clients can be traditional applications, X servers (rootless or fullscreen) or other display servers. Part of the Wayland project is also the Weston reference implementation of a Wayland compositor. Weston can run as an X client or under Linux KMS and ships with a few demo clients. The Weston compositor is a minimal and fast compositor and is suitable for many embedded and mobile use cases.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn internal reference count is held on the buffer pool, incremented every time a new buffer is created from the pool. The reference count is maintained as an int; on LP64 systems this can cause the reference count to overflow if the client creates a large number of wl_shm buffer objects, or if it can coerce the server to create a large number of external references to the buffer storage. With the reference count overflowing, a use-after-free can be constructed on the wl_shm_pool tracking structure, where values may be incremented or decremented; it may also be possible to construct a limited oracle to leak 4 bytes of server-side memory to the attacking client at a time.(CVE-2021-3782)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wayland","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/wayland&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.17.0-3.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["wayland-debuginfo-1.17.0-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","wayland-debugsource-1.17.0-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","wayland-devel-1.17.0-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","wayland-1.17.0-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["wayland-help-1.17.0-3.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["wayland-1.17.0-3.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["wayland-debuginfo-1.17.0-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","wayland-devel-1.17.0-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","wayland-debugsource-1.17.0-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","wayland-1.17.0-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1920.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wayland","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/wayland&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.17.0-3.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["wayland-1.17.0-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","wayland-devel-1.17.0-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","wayland-debugsource-1.17.0-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","wayland-debuginfo-1.17.0-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["wayland-help-1.17.0-3.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["wayland-1.17.0-3.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["wayland-devel-1.17.0-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","wayland-1.17.0-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","wayland-debugsource-1.17.0-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","wayland-debuginfo-1.17.0-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1920.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wayland","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/wayland&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.19.91-4.oe2203"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["wayland-debuginfo-1.19.91-4.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","wayland-1.19.91-4.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","wayland-devel-1.19.91-4.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","wayland-debugsource-1.19.91-4.oe2203.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["wayland-help-1.19.91-4.oe2203.noarch.rpm"],"src":["wayland-1.19.91-4.oe2203.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["wayland-devel-1.19.91-4.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","wayland-1.19.91-4.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","wayland-debuginfo-1.19.91-4.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","wayland-debugsource-1.19.91-4.oe2203.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1920.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2022-1920"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3782"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
