The type of the 1st argument is supposed to be an array, but it's not enforced. This makes it possible to specify any object with a `push` function as the 1st argument, `push` function can be set to any function that can be access via `event.view` (no all such functions can be exploited due to invalid context or signature, but some can, e.g. `console.log`). The issue is that`lassoAppend` doesn't enforce proper types of its arguments. This issue opens various XSS vectors, but exact impact and severity depends on the environment (e.g. Core JS `setImmediate` polyfill basically allows `eval`-like functionality). This issue was patched in 5.23.0.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"vega.js","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/vega.js?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.22.1+ds+~3.1.0-4","5.25.0+ds+~cs5.3.0-1","5.25.0+ds+~cs5.3.0-2","5.25.0+ds+~cs5.3.0-3","5.25.0+ds+~cs5.3.0-4","5.25.0+ds+~cs5.3.0-5","5.28.0+ds+~cs5.3.0-1","5.28.0+ds+~cs5.3.0-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-26487.json"}},{"package":{"name":"vega.js","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/vega.js?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.25.0+ds+~cs5.3.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-26487.json"}},{"package":{"name":"vega.js","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/vega.js?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.25.0+ds+~cs5.3.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-26487.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-26487"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
