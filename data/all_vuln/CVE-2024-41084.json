  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncxl/region: Avoid null pointer dereference in region lookup\n\ncxl_dpa_to_region() looks up a region based on a memdev and DPA.\nIt wrongly assumes an endpoint found mapping the DPA is also of\na fully assembled region. When not true it leads to a null pointer\ndereference looking up the region name.\n\nThis appears during testing of region lookup after a failure to\nassemble a BIOS defined region or if the lookup raced with the\nassembly of the BIOS defined region.\n\nFailure to clean up BIOS defined regions that fail assembly is an\nissue in itself and a fix to that problem will alleviate some of\nthe impact. It will not alleviate the race condition so let's harden\nthis path.\n\nThe behavior change is that the kernel oops due to a null pointer\ndereference is replaced with a dev_dbg() message noting that an\nendpoint was mapped.\n\nAdditional comments are added so that future users of this function\ncan more clearly understand what it provides.",
