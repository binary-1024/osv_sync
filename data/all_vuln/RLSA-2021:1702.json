  "details": "Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression ratio comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with deflate but offers more dense compression. \n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* brotli: buffer overflow when input chunk is larger than 2GiB (CVE-2020-8927)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nAdditional Changes:\n\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the Rocky Linux 8.4 Release Notes linked from the References section.",
