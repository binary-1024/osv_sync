When a thread aborts currently executing jobs due to a fault, it first locks the global lock protecting submitted_jobs (#1).  After the last job is destroyed, it proceeds to release the related context and locks file_priv (#2). Meanwhile, in the job submission thread, the file_priv lock (#2) is taken first, and then the submitted_jobs lock (#1) is obtained when a job is added to the submitted jobs list.
