  "details": "QEMU is a FAST! processor emulator using dynamic translation to achieve good emulation speed.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in vhost-user-gpu of QEMU in versions up to and including 6.0. An out-of-bounds write vulnerability can allow a malicious guest to crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.(CVE-2021-3546)\r\n\r\nAn information disclosure vulnerability was found in the virtio vhost-user GPU device (vhost-user-gpu) of QEMU in versions up to and including 6.0. The flaw exists in virgl_cmd_get_capset_info() in contrib/vhost-user-gpu/virgl.c and could occur due to the read of uninitialized memory. A malicious guest could exploit this issue to leak memory from the host.(CVE-2021-3545)\r\n\r\nSeveral memory leaks were found in the virtio vhost-user GPU device (vhost-user-gpu) of QEMU in versions up to and including 6.0. They exist in contrib/vhost-user-gpu/vhost-user-gpu.c and contrib/vhost-user-gpu/virgl.c due to improper release of memory (i.e., free) after effective lifetime.(CVE-2021-3544)",
