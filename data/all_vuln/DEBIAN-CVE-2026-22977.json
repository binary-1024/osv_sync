{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22977","published":"2026-01-21T14:16:06.853Z","modified":"2026-01-22T11:16:50.919827Z","upstream":["CVE-2026-22977"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: sock: fix hardened usercopy panic in sock_recv_errqueue  skbuff_fclone_cache was created without defining a usercopy region, [1] unlike skbuff_head_cache which properly whitelists the cb[] field. [2] This causes a usercopy BUG() when CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY is enabled and the kernel attempts to copy sk_buff.cb data to userspace via sock_recv_errqueue() -> put_cmsg().  The crash occurs when: 1. TCP allocates an skb using alloc_skb_fclone()    (from skbuff_fclone_cache) [1] 2. The skb is cloned via skb_clone() using the pre-allocated fclone [3] 3. The cloned skb is queued to sk_error_queue for timestamp reporting 4. Userspace reads the error queue via recvmsg(MSG_ERRQUEUE) 5. sock_recv_errqueue() calls put_cmsg() to copy serr->ee from skb->cb [4] 6. __check_heap_object() fails because skbuff_fclone_cache has no    usercopy whitelist [5]  When cloned skbs allocated from skbuff_fclone_cache are used in the socket error queue, accessing the sock_exterr_skb structure in skb->cb via put_cmsg() triggers a usercopy hardening violation:  [    5.379589] usercopy: Kernel memory exposure attempt detected from SLUB object 'skbuff_fclone_cache' (offset 296, size 16)!
