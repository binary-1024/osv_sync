NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this report, stating that \"This is not a security problem in Varnish or any other piece of software which writes a logfile. The real problem is the mistaken belief that you can cat(1) a random logfile to your terminal safely.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"varnish","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/varnish?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.5.1-1","6.5.1-1+deb11u1","6.5.1-1+deb11u2","6.5.1-1+deb11u3","6.5.1-1+deb11u4","6.5.1-1+deb11u5","6.5.2-1","6.6.1-1","7.1.0-4","7.1.0-5","7.1.0-6","7.1.1-1","7.1.1-1.1","7.1.1-1.2","7.5.0-1","7.5.0-2","7.5.0-3","7.6.0-1","7.6.0-2","7.6.1-1","7.6.1-2","7.7.0-1","7.7.0-2","7.7.0-3","7.7.1-1","7.7.2-1","7.7.2-2","7.7.3-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2009-4488.json"}},{"package":{"name":"varnish","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/varnish?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["7.1.1-1.1","7.1.1-1.1+deb12u1","7.1.1-1.2","7.1.1-2+deb12u1","7.5.0-1","7.5.0-2","7.5.0-3","7.6.0-1","7.6.0-2","7.6.1-1","7.6.1-2","7.7.0-1","7.7.0-2","7.7.0-3","7.7.1-1","7.7.2-1","7.7.2-2","7.7.3-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2009-4488.json"}},{"package":{"name":"varnish","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/varnish?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["7.7.0-3","7.7.1-1","7.7.2-1","7.7.2-2","7.7.3-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2009-4488.json"}},{"package":{"name":"varnish","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/varnish?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["7.7.0-3","7.7.1-1","7.7.2-1","7.7.2-2","7.7.3-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2009-4488.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4488"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
