  "details": "rust-openssl is a set of OpenSSL bindings for the Rust programming language. In affected versions `ssl::select_next_proto` can return a slice pointing into the `server` argument's buffer but with a lifetime bound to the `client` argument. In situations where the `sever` buffer's lifetime is shorter than the `client` buffer's, this can cause a use after free. This could cause the server to crash or to return arbitrary memory contents to the client. The crate`openssl` version 0.10.70 fixes the signature of `ssl::select_next_proto` to properly constrain the output buffer's lifetime to that of both input buffers. Users are advised to upgrade. In standard usage of `ssl::select_next_proto` in the callback passed to `SslContextBuilder::set_alpn_select_callback`, code is only affected if the `server` buffer is constructed *within* the callback.",
