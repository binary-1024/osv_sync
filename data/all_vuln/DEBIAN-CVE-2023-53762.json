{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53762","published":"2025-12-08T02:15:52.043Z","modified":"2025-12-08T11:06:19.168316Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-53762"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: hci_sync: Fix UAF in hci_disconnect_all_sync  Use-after-free can occur in hci_disconnect_all_sync if a connection is deleted by concurrent processing of a controller event.  To prevent this the code now tries to iterate over the list backwards to ensure the links are cleanup before its parents, also it no longer relies on a cursor, instead it always uses the last element since hci_abort_conn_sync is guaranteed to call hci_conn_del.
