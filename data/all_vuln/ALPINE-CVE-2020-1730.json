The server or client could crash when the connection hasn't been fully initialized and the system tries to cleanup the ciphers when closing the connection. The biggest threat from this vulnerability is system availability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libssh?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.8.9-r0"}]}],"versions":["0.4.5-r0","0.4.6-r0","0.4.8-r0","0.5.0-r0","0.5.1-r0","0.5.2-r0","0.5.2-r1","0.5.3-r0","0.5.4-r0","0.5.5-r0","0.6.0-r0","0.6.3-r0","0.6.4-r0","0.6.5-r0","0.7.0-r0","0.7.1-r0","0.7.2-r0","0.7.3-r0","0.7.3-r1","0.7.4-r0","0.7.5-r0","0.7.5-r1","0.7.5-r2","0.7.5-r3","0.7.6-r0","0.7.6-r1","0.8.8-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-1730.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libssh?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.9.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["0.4.5-r0","0.4.6-r0","0.4.8-r0","0.5.0-r0","0.5.1-r0","0.5.2-r0","0.5.2-r1","0.5.3-r0","0.5.4-r0","0.5.5-r0","0.6.0-r0","0.6.3-r0","0.6.4-r0","0.6.5-r0","0.7.0-r0","0.7.1-r0","0.7.2-r0","0.7.3-r0","0.7.3-r1","0.7.4-r0","0.7.5-r0","0.7.5-r1","0.7.5-r2","0.7.5-r3","0.7.6-r0","0.7.6-r1","0.8.7-r0","0.9.0-r0","0.9.2-r0","0.9.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-1730.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.9","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libssh?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.7.6-r3"}]}],"versions":["0.4.5-r0","0.4.6-r0","0.4.8-r0","0.5.0-r0","0.5.1-r0","0.5.2-r0","0.5.2-r1","0.5.3-r0","0.5.4-r0","0.5.5-r0","0.6.0-r0","0.6.3-r0","0.6.4-r0","0.6.5-r0","0.7.0-r0","0.7.1-r0","0.7.2-r0","0.7.3-r0","0.7.3-r1","0.7.4-r0","0.7.5-r0","0.7.5-r1","0.7.5-r2","0.7.5-r3","0.7.6-r0","0.7.6-r1","0.7.6-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-1730.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2020-1730"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
