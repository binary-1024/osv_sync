NOTE: this is different from CVE-2018-6556 because the CVE-2018-6556 fix design was based on the premise that &quot;we will report back to the user that the open() failed but the user has no way of knowing why it failed&quot;; however, in many realistic cases, there are no plausible reasons for failing except that the file does not exist.(CVE-2022-47952)",
