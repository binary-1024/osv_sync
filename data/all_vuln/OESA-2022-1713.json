For instance, it can be used to check that environment can support fast path applications such as 6WINDGate, pktgen, rumptcpip, etc. More libraries are available as extensions in other packages.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s an issue in the handling of vhost-user inflight type messages. A malicious vhost-user master can attach an unexpected number of fds as ancillary data to VHOST_USER_GET_INFLIGHT_FD / VHOST_USER_SET_INFLIGHT_FD messages that are not closed by the vhost-user slave. By sending such messages continuously, the vhost-user master could exhaust available fd in the vhost-user slave process and lead to a DoS.(CVE-2022-0669)\r\n\r\nIn DPDK Vhost communication, we didn\u2019t test if msg->payload.inflight.num_queues is out of bounds in function \u2018vhost_user_set_inflight_fd()\u2019, and could cause the program to write OOB.(CVE-2021-3839)",
