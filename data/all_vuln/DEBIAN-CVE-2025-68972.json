This is related to use of \\f as a marker to denote truncation of a long plaintext line.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gnupg2","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gnupg2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.2.27-2","2.2.27-2+deb11u1","2.2.27-2+deb11u2","2.2.27-3","2.2.34-1","2.2.35-1","2.2.35-2","2.2.35-3","2.2.39-1","2.2.40-1","2.2.40-1+hurd.1","2.2.40-1.1","2.2.40-1.1+hurd.1","2.2.40-1.1+loong64","2.2.40-2","2.2.40-3","2.2.43-1","2.2.43-2","2.2.43-3","2.2.43-4","2.2.43-5","2.2.43-6","2.2.43-7","2.2.43-8","2.2.44-1","2.2.45-1","2.2.45-2","2.2.45-3","2.2.46-1","2.2.46-2","2.2.46-3","2.2.46-4","2.2.46-5","2.2.46-6","2.2.46~pre1-1","2.3.1-1","2.4.3-2","2.4.4-1","2.4.4-2","2.4.4-3","2.4.4-4","2.4.5-1","2.4.5-2","2.4.5-3","2.4.6-1","2.4.7-1","2.4.7-10","2.4.7-11","2.4.7-12","2.4.7-13","2.4.7-14","2.4.7-15","2.4.7-16","2.4.7-17","2.4.7-18","2.4.7-19","2.4.7-2","2.4.7-20","2.4.7-21","2.4.7-3","2.4.7-4","2.4.7-5","2.4.7-6","2.4.7-7","2.4.7-8","2.4.7-9","2.4.8-1","2.4.8-2","2.4.8-3","2.4.8-4","2.4.8-5","2.4.8-6","2.4.9-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68972.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnupg2","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gnupg2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.2.40-1.1","2.2.40-1.1+deb12u1","2.2.40-1.1+deb12u2","2.2.40-1.1+hurd.1","2.2.40-1.1+loong64","2.2.40-2","2.2.40-3","2.2.43-1","2.2.43-2","2.2.43-3","2.2.43-4","2.2.43-5","2.2.43-6","2.2.43-7","2.2.43-8","2.2.44-1","2.2.45-1","2.2.45-2","2.2.45-3","2.2.46-1","2.2.46-2","2.2.46-3","2.2.46-4","2.2.46-5","2.2.46-6","2.2.46~pre1-1","2.3.1-1","2.4.3-2","2.4.4-1","2.4.4-2","2.4.4-3","2.4.4-4","2.4.5-1","2.4.5-2","2.4.5-3","2.4.6-1","2.4.7-1","2.4.7-10","2.4.7-11","2.4.7-12","2.4.7-13","2.4.7-14","2.4.7-15","2.4.7-16","2.4.7-17","2.4.7-18","2.4.7-19","2.4.7-2","2.4.7-20","2.4.7-21","2.4.7-3","2.4.7-4","2.4.7-5","2.4.7-6","2.4.7-7","2.4.7-8","2.4.7-9","2.4.8-1","2.4.8-2","2.4.8-3","2.4.8-4","2.4.8-5","2.4.8-6","2.4.9-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68972.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnupg2","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gnupg2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.7-21","2.4.7-21+deb13u1","2.4.8-1","2.4.8-2","2.4.8-3","2.4.8-4","2.4.8-5","2.4.8-6","2.4.9-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68972.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnupg2","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gnupg2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.7-21","2.4.8-1","2.4.8-2","2.4.8-3","2.4.8-4","2.4.8-5","2.4.8-6","2.4.9-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68972.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-68972"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
