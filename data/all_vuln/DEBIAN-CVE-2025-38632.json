  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pinmux: fix race causing mux_owner NULL with active mux_usecount  commit 5a3e85c3c397 (\"pinmux: Use sequential access to access desc->pinmux data\") tried to address the issue when two client of the same gpio calls pinctrl_select_state() for the same functionality, was resulting in NULL pointer issue while accessing desc->mux_owner. However, issue was not completely fixed due to the way it was handled and it can still result in the same NULL pointer.  The issue occurs due to the following interleaving:       cpu0 (process A)                   cpu1 (process B)        pin_request() {                   pin_free() {                                           mutex_lock()                                          desc->mux_usecount--; //becomes 0                                          ..                                          mutex_unlock()    mutex_lock(desc->mux)   desc->mux_usecount++; // becomes 1   desc->mux_owner = owner;   mutex_unlock(desc->mux)                                           mutex_lock(desc->mux)                                          desc->mux_owner = NULL;                                          mutex_unlock(desc->mux)  This sequence leads to a state where the pin appears to be in use (`mux_usecount == 1`) but has no owner (`mux_owner == NULL`), which can cause NULL pointer on next pin_request on the same pin.  Ensure that updates to mux_usecount and mux_owner are performed atomically under the same lock. Only clear mux_owner when mux_usecount reaches zero and no new owner has been assigned.",
