  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  hisi_acc_vfio_pci: bugfix live migration function without VF device driver  If the VF device driver is not loaded in the Guest OS and we attempt to perform device data migration, the address of the migrated data will be NULL. The live migration recovery operation on the destination side will access a null address value, which will cause access errors.  Therefore, live migration of VMs without added VF device drivers does not require device data migration. In addition, when the queue address data obtained by the destination is empty, device queue recovery processing will not be performed.",
