When an HTTP request using TLS/1.3 early data on top of TCP Fast Open or QUIC 0-RTT packets is received and the IP-address-based access control is used, the access control does not detect and prohibit HTTP requests conveyed by packets with a spoofed source address. This behavior allows attackers on the network to execute HTTP requests from addresses that are otherwise rejected by the address-based access control. The vulnerability has been addressed in commit 15ed15a. Users may disable the use of TCP FastOpen and QUIC to mitigate the issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"h2o","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/h2o?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.2.5+dfsg2-10","2.2.5+dfsg2-11","2.2.5+dfsg2-6","2.2.5+dfsg2-6.1","2.2.5+dfsg2-6.2","2.2.5+dfsg2-7","2.2.5+dfsg2-8","2.2.5+dfsg2-8.1","2.2.5+dfsg2-8.1~exp1","2.2.5+dfsg2-9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-45397.json"}},{"package":{"name":"h2o","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/h2o?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.2.5+dfsg2-10","2.2.5+dfsg2-11","2.2.5+dfsg2-7","2.2.5+dfsg2-8","2.2.5+dfsg2-8.1","2.2.5+dfsg2-8.1~exp1","2.2.5+dfsg2-9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-45397.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-45397"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
