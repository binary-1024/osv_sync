The change in MSR is done in enter_rtas() in a relatively complex way, since the MSR value could be hardcoded.  Furthermore, a panic has been reported when hitting the watchdog interrupt while running in RTAS, this leads to the following stack trace:    watchdog: CPU 24 Hard LOCKUP   watchdog: CPU 24 TB:997512652051031, last heartbeat TB:997504470175378 (15980ms ago)   ...

RTAS is expected to be called with MSR[RI] as specified in PAPR+ section \"7.2.1 Machine State\":    R1–7.2.1–9. If called with MSR[RI] equal to 1, then RTAS must protect   its own critical regions from recursion by setting the MSR[RI] bit to   0 when in the critical regions.  Fixing this by reviewing the way MSR is compute before calling RTAS.
