In versions 7.0.10 and below and  8.0.0-beta1 through 8.0.0-rc1, mishandling of data on HTTP2 stream 0 can lead to uncontrolled memory usage, leading to loss of visibility. Workarounds include disabling the HTTP/2 parser, and using a signature like drop http2 any any -> any any (frame:http2.hdr; byte_test:1,=,0,3; byte_test:4,=,0,5; sid: 1;) where the first byte test tests the HTTP2 frame type DATA and the second tests the stream id 0. This is fixed in versions 7.0.11 and 8.0.0.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"suricata","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/suricata?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:6.0.1-3","1:6.0.1-3+deb11u1","1:6.0.10-1","1:6.0.10-1~bpo11+1","1:6.0.13-1","1:6.0.2-1~exp1","1:6.0.3-1","1:6.0.3-1~exp1","1:6.0.3-1~exp2","1:6.0.3-2","1:6.0.3-2~bpo11+1","1:6.0.4-1","1:6.0.4-2","1:6.0.4-2~bpo10+1","1:6.0.4-2~bpo11+1","1:6.0.4-3","1:6.0.5-1","1:6.0.5-2","1:6.0.5-2~bpo10+1","1:6.0.5-2~bpo11+1","1:6.0.5-3","1:6.0.6-1","1:6.0.6-1~bpo10+1","1:6.0.6-1~bpo11+1","1:6.0.6-2","1:6.0.8-1","1:6.0.8-1~bpo11+1","1:6.0.9-1","1:6.0.9-1~bpo11+1","1:7.0.0-1","1:7.0.0-2","1:7.0.0-2~bpo12+1","1:7.0.1-1","1:7.0.10-1","1:7.0.10-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.11-1","1:7.0.11-1~bpo13+1","1:7.0.2-1","1:7.0.2-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.2-2","1:7.0.2-2~exp1","1:7.0.2-2~exp2","1:7.0.3-1","1:7.0.3-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.4-1","1:7.0.5-1","1:7.0.5-2~bpo12+1","1:7.0.6-1","1:7.0.6-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.6-2~exp1","1:7.0.7-1","1:7.0.7-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.8-1","1:7.0.8-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.8-2","1:7.0.9-1","1:8.0.0-1~exp1","1:8.0.0-1~exp2","1:8.0.0-1~exp4","1:8.0.0-1~exp5","1:8.0.1-1","1:8.0.1-2","1:8.0.1-3","1:8.0.1-3~bpo13+1","1:8.0.2-1","1:8.0.2-1~bpo13+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-53538.json"}},{"package":{"name":"suricata","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/suricata?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:6.0.10-1","1:6.0.13-1","1:7.0.0-1","1:7.0.0-2","1:7.0.0-2~bpo12+1","1:7.0.1-1","1:7.0.10-1","1:7.0.10-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.11-1","1:7.0.11-1~bpo13+1","1:7.0.2-1","1:7.0.2-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.2-2","1:7.0.2-2~exp1","1:7.0.2-2~exp2","1:7.0.3-1","1:7.0.3-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.4-1","1:7.0.5-1","1:7.0.5-2~bpo12+1","1:7.0.6-1","1:7.0.6-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.6-2~exp1","1:7.0.7-1","1:7.0.7-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.8-1","1:7.0.8-1~bpo12+1","1:7.0.8-2","1:7.0.9-1","1:8.0.0-1~exp1","1:8.0.0-1~exp2","1:8.0.0-1~exp4","1:8.0.0-1~exp5","1:8.0.1-1","1:8.0.1-2","1:8.0.1-3","1:8.0.1-3~bpo13+1","1:8.0.2-1","1:8.0.2-1~bpo13+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-53538.json"}},{"package":{"name":"suricata","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/suricata?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:7.0.10-1+deb13u1"}]}],"versions":["1:7.0.10-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-53538.json"}},{"package":{"name":"suricata","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/suricata?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:7.0.11-1"}]}],"versions":["1:7.0.10-1","1:7.0.11-1~bpo13+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-53538.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-53538"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
