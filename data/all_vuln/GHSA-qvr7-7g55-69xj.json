Attackers can still inject SQL payloads that do not rely on comments and infer database information via blind techniques. This vulnerability affects the admin interface and can lead to **database information disclosure**.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability exists in the Admin Search Find API endpoint:\n```\n/admin/search/search/find\n```\nIn CVE-2023-30848, the following patch was applied:\n\n- SQL comments are removed by replacing `--`\n- SQL syntax errors are caught and replaced with a generic exception\n\nRelevant commit:  \nhttps://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/commit/25ad8674886f2b938243cbe13e33e204a2e35cc3\n\nKey changes include:\n```\n// remove sql comments\n$fields = str_replace('--', '', $fields);\n\ntry {\n    $hits = $searcherList->load();\n} catch (SyntaxErrorException $syntaxErrorException) {\n    throw new \\InvalidArgumentException('Check your arguments.');\n}\n```\nHowever, this mitigation is incomplete for the following reasons:\n\n**1. Only `--` is filtered**\n\nSQL injection does not require SQL comments. Payloads using boolean conditions, SQL functions, or time-based expressions remain effective.\n\n**2. Exception handling only suppresses error output**\n\nWhile syntax errors no longer produce detailed error messages, the underlying SQL query is still executed. This allows attackers to perform blind SQL injection.\n\n**3. User-controlled input is still used in SQL query construction**\nThe `fields[]` parameter is attacker-controlled and can be abused to inject SQL expressions into the generated query.\n\nAs a result, attackers can craft payloads that do not trigger syntax errors and still influence SQL execution.\n### PoC\nThe following request demonstrates a **blind SQL injection** via the `fields[]` parameter.\n\n**Boolean-based Blind Injection**\n```\nGET /admin/search/search/find?query=2&\nfields[]=field1 AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)=1~field2&\nfilter=[{\"property\":\"value\"}]&\nclass=classname\n```\n**Time-based Blind Injection**\n```\nGET /admin/search/search/find?query=2&\nfields[]=field1 AND IF(1=1,SLEEP(5),0)~field2&\nfilter=[{\"property\":\"value\"}]&\nclass=classname\n```\n**Observed behavior:**\n\n- When the condition is true, the response is delayed (e.g., ~5 seconds)\n\n- When the condition is false, the response is returned immediately\n\nThis confirms that injected SQL expressions are executed successfully.\n### Impact\nThis is a **Blind SQL Injection vulnerability.**\n\n- Affected users: Systems exposing the Admin Search Find API to authenticated users\n\n- Attack requirements: Authenticated access to the admin interface\n\n- Potential impact:\n\n  - Database schema enumeration\n  \n  - Extraction of sensitive data via blind SQL injection\n  \n  - Potential full database compromise depending on database privileges\n\nThis issue demonstrates that the fix for CVE-2023-30848 is **incomplete.**","affected":[{"package":{"name":"pimcore/pimcore","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/pimcore/pimcore"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"12.0.0-RC1"},{"fixed":"12.3.1"}]}],"versions":["v12.0.0","v12.0.0-RC1","v12.0.0-RC2","v12.0.1","v12.0.2","v12.0.3","v12.0.4","v12.1.0","v12.1.1","v12.1.2","v12.1.3","v12.1.4","v12.1.5","v12.2.0","v12.2.1","v12.2.2","v12.2.3","v12.2.4","v12.3.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-qvr7-7g55-69xj/GHSA-qvr7-7g55-69xj.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pimcore/pimcore","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/pimcore/pimcore"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"11.5.14"}]}],"versions":["10.0.8","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.3.0","3.0.0","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.0.5","3.0.6","3.1.0","3.1.1","4.0.0","4.0.1","4.1.0","4.1.1","4.1.2","4.1.3","4.2.0","4.3.0","4.3.1","4.4.0","4.4.1","4.4.2","4.4.3","4.5.0","4.6.0","4.6.1","4.6.2","4.6.3","4.6.4","4.6.5","v10.0.0","v10.0.0-BETA1","v10.0.0-BETA2","v10.0.0-BETA3","v10.0.0-BETA4","v10.0.1","v10.0.2","v10.0.3","v10.0.4","v10.0.5","v10.0.6","v10.0.7","v10.0.9","v10.1.0","v10.1.1","v10.1.2","v10.1.3","v10.1.4","v10.1.5","v10.2.0","v10.2.1","v10.2.10","v10.2.2","v10.2.3","v10.2.4","v10.2.5","v10.2.6","v10.2.7","v10.2.8","v10.2.9","v10.3.0","v10.3.1","v10.3.2","v10.3.3","v10.3.4","v10.3.5","v10.3.6","v10.3.7","v10.4.0","v10.4.1","v10.4.2","v10.4.3","v10.4.4","v10.4.5","v10.4.6","v10.5.0","v10.5.1","v10.5.10","v10.5.11","v10.5.12","v10.5.13","v10.5.14","v10.5.15","v10.5.16","v10.5.17","v10.5.18","v10.5.19","v10.5.2","v10.5.20","v10.5.21","v10.5.22","v10.5.23","v10.5.24","v10.5.25","v10.5.3","v10.5.4","v10.5.5","v10.5.6","v10.5.7","v10.5.8","v10.5.9","v10.6.0","v10.6.1","v10.6.2","v10.6.3","v10.6.4","v10.6.5","v10.6.6","v10.6.7","v10.6.8","v10.6.9","v11.0.0","v11.0.0-ALPHA1","v11.0.0-ALPHA2","v11.0.0-ALPHA3","v11.0.0-ALPHA4","v11.0.0-ALPHA5","v11.0.0-ALPHA6","v11.0.0-ALPHA7","v11.0.0-ALPHA8","v11.0.0-BETA1","v11.0.0-RC1","v11.0.0-RC2","v11.0.1","v11.0.10","v11.0.11","v11.0.12","v11.0.2","v11.0.3","v11.0.4","v11.0.5","v11.0.6","v11.0.7","v11.0.8","v11.0.9","v11.1.0","v11.1.0-RC1","v11.1.1","v11.1.2","v11.1.3","v11.1.4","v11.1.5","v11.1.6","v11.2.0","v11.2.1","v11.2.2","v11.2.3","v11.2.4","v11.2.5","v11.2.6","v11.2.7","v11.3.0","v11.3.0-RC1","v11.3.0-RC2","v11.3.1","v11.3.2","v11.3.3","v11.4.0","v11.4.0-RC1","v11.4.1","v11.4.2","v11.4.3","v11.4.4","v11.5.0","v11.5.0-RC1","v11.5.0-RC2","v11.5.1","v11.5.10","v11.5.11","v11.5.12","v11.5.13","v11.5.2","v11.5.3","v11.5.4","v11.5.5","v11.5.6","v11.5.7","v11.5.8","v11.5.9","v5.0.0","v5.0.0-RC","v5.0.1","v5.0.2","v5.0.3","v5.0.4","v5.1.0","v5.1.0-alpha","v5.1.1","v5.1.2","v5.1.3","v5.2.0","v5.2.1","v5.2.2","v5.2.3","v5.3.0","v5.3.1","v5.4.0","v5.4.1","v5.4.2","v5.4.3","v5.4.4","v5.5.0","v5.5.1","v5.5.2","v5.5.3","v5.5.4","v5.6.0","v5.6.1","v5.6.2","v5.6.3","v5.6.4","v5.6.5","v5.6.6","v5.7.0","v5.7.1","v5.7.2","v5.7.3","v5.8.0","v5.8.1","v5.8.2","v5.8.3","v5.8.4","v5.8.5","v5.8.6","v5.8.7","v5.8.8","v5.8.9","v6.0.0","v6.0.1","v6.0.2","v6.0.3","v6.0.4","v6.0.5","v6.1.0","v6.1.1","v6.1.2","v6.2.0","v6.2.1","v6.2.2","v6.2.3","v6.3.0","v6.3.1","v6.3.2","v6.3.3","v6.3.4","v6.3.5","v6.3.6","v6.4.0","v6.4.1","v6.4.2","v6.5.0","v6.5.1","v6.5.2","v6.5.3","v6.6.0","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.2","v6.6.3","v6.6.4","v6.6.5","v6.6.6","v6.6.7","v6.6.8","v6.6.9","v6.7.0","v6.7.1","v6.7.2","v6.7.3","v6.8.0","v6.8.1","v6.8.10","v6.8.11","v6.8.12","v6.8.2","v6.8.3","v6.8.4","v6.8.5","v6.8.6","v6.8.7","v6.8.8","v6.8.9","v6.9.0","v6.9.1","v6.9.2","v6.9.3","v6.9.4","v6.9.5","v6.9.6"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 11.5.13","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-qvr7-7g55-69xj/GHSA-qvr7-7g55-69xj.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/security/advisories/GHSA-qvr7-7g55-69xj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23492"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/commit/25ad8674886f2b938243cbe13e33e204a2e35cc3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6mhm-gcpf-5gr8"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-89"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-14T21:15:43Z","nvd_published_at":"2026-01-14T19:16:48Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
