When new URL() throws an error, it can be manipulated to misinterpret the hostname. An attacker could exploit this weakness to redirect traffic to a malicious site, potentially leading to information disclosure, phishing attacks, or other security breaches.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"node-follow-redirects","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-follow-redirects?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.13.1-1","1.13.1-1+deb11u1","1.14.5-1","1.14.7+~1.13.1-1","1.14.8+~1.14.0-1","1.14.9+~1.14.1-1","1.14.9+~1.14.1-2","1.14.9+~1.14.1-3","1.15.1+~1.14.1-1","1.15.1+~1.14.1-2","1.15.1+~1.14.1-3","1.15.2+~1.14.1-1","1.15.3+~1.14.2-1","1.15.6+~1.14.4-1","1.15.6+~1.14.4-2","1.15.9+~1.14.4-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-26159.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-follow-redirects","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-follow-redirects?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.15.2+~1.14.1-1","1.15.3+~1.14.2-1","1.15.6+~1.14.4-1","1.15.6+~1.14.4-2","1.15.9+~1.14.4-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-26159.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-follow-redirects","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-follow-redirects?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.15.6+~1.14.4-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-26159.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-follow-redirects","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-follow-redirects?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.15.6+~1.14.4-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-26159.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-26159"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
