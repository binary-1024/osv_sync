This issue has been addressed in version 1.1.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are several ways to workaround or lower the probability of this bug affecting a given deployment. 1: use a reasonably high `POLL_TIMEOUT` setting, like the default. 2: use separate libmemcached connections for unrelated data. 3: do not re-use libmemcached connections in an unknown state.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/awesomized/libmemcached","events":[{"introduced":"abd18855286e265eb25f4e76d48c19ce4f48fcfd"},{"fixed":"92d18858b417309f6bdee6bce464a4f3d6a375fd"}]}],"versions":["1.0.18","1.1.0","1.1.0-beta1","1.1.0-beta2","1.1.0-beta3","1.1.1","1.1.2","1.1.3","post_cmake","pre_cmake"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-27478.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/27xxx/CVE-2023-27478.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/awesomized/libmemcached/commit/48dcc61a"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/awesomized/libmemcached/releases/tag/1.1.4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/awesomized/libmemcached/security/advisories/GHSA-wwmh-39wj-fx59"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/php-memcached-dev/php-memcached/issues/531"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27478"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-200"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/27xxx/CVE-2023-27478.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
