It has a vast and comprehensive standard library of frequently used querying functions and can be extend even further with user-specified functions. YAQL is written in python and is distributed via PyPI.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nIn OpenStack Murano through 16.0.0, when YAQL before 3.0.0 is used, the Murano service&apos;s MuranoPL extension to the YAQL language fails to sanitize the supplied environment, leading to potential leakage of sensitive service account information.(CVE-2024-29156)",
