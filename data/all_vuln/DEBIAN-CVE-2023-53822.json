When max virtual ap interfaces are configured in all the bands with ACS and hostapd restart is done every 60s, a crash is observed at random times. In this certain scenario, a fragmented packet is received for self peer, for which rx_tid and rx_frags are not initialized in datapath. While handling this fragment, crash is observed as the rx_frag list is uninitialised and when we walk in ath11k_dp_rx_h_sort_frags, skb null leads to exception.  To address this, before processing received fragments we check dp_setup_done flag is set to ensure that peer has completed its dp peer setup for fragment queue, else ignore processing the fragments.
