  "details": "USN-6744-1 fixed a vulnerability in Pillow. This update\nprovides the corresponding updates for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Hugo van Kemenade discovered that Pillow was not properly performing \n bounds checks when processing an ICC file, which could lead to a buffer\n overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a \n specially crafted ICC file, an attacker could possibly use this issue \n to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.\n",
