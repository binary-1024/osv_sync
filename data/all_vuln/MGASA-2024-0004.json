  "details": "Parts of the SSH specification are vulnerable to a novel prefix\ntruncation attack (a.k.a. Terrapin attack), which allows a\nman-in-the-middle attacker to strip an arbitrary number of messages\nright after the initial key exchange, breaking SSH extension negotiation\n(RFC8308) in the process and thus downgrading connection security.\n### Mitigations\nTo mitigate this protocol vulnerability, OpenSSH suggested a so-called\n\"strict kex\" which alters the SSH handshake to ensure a\nMan-in-the-Middle attacker cannot introduce unauthenticated messages as\nwell as convey sequence number manipulation across handshakes. Support\nfor strict key exchange has been added to a variety of SSH\nimplementations, including OpenSSH itself, PuTTY, libssh, and more.\nThis release includes a patch to implement Strict KEX mode.\n",
