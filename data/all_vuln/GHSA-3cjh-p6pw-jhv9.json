A cache key may become expired when all `Pow.Store.Backend.MnesiaCache` instances have been shut down for a period that is longer than the keys' remaining TTL and the expired key won't be invalidated on startups.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe expired keys, including all expired sessions, can be manually invalidated by running:\n\n```elixir\n:mnesia.sync_transaction(fn ->\n  Enum.each(:mnesia.dirty_select(Pow.Store.Backend.MnesiaCache, [{{Pow.Store.Backend.MnesiaCache, :_, :_}, [], [:\"$_\"]}]), fn {_, key,  {_value, expire}} ->\n    ttl = expire - :os.system_time(:millisecond)\n    if ttl < 0, do: :mnesia.delete({Pow.Store.Backend.MnesiaCache, key})\n  end)\nend)\n```\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/pow-auth/pow/commit/15dc525be03c466daa5d2119ca7acdec7b24ed17\nhttps://github.com/pow-auth/pow/issues/713\nhttps://github.com/pow-auth/pow/pull/714\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"pow","ecosystem":"Hex","purl":"pkg:hex/pow"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.0.14"},{"fixed":"1.0.34"}]}],"versions":["1.0.14","1.0.15","1.0.16","1.0.17","1.0.18","1.0.19","1.0.20","1.0.21","1.0.22","1.0.23","1.0.24","1.0.25","1.0.26","1.0.27","1.0.28","1.0.29","1.0.30","1.0.31","1.0.32","1.0.33"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/09/GHSA-3cjh-p6pw-jhv9/GHSA-3cjh-p6pw-jhv9.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pow-auth/pow/security/advisories/GHSA-3cjh-p6pw-jhv9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42446"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pow-auth/pow/issues/713"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pow-auth/pow/pull/714"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pow-auth/pow/commit/15dc525be03c466daa5d2119ca7acdec7b24ed17"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/pow-auth/pow"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-298","CWE-672"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-09-19T17:00:08Z","nvd_published_at":"2023-09-18T22:15:47Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
