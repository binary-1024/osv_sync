  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  riscv: process: Fix kernel gp leakage  childregs represents the registers which are active for the new thread in user context. For a kernel thread, childregs->gp is never used since the kernel gp is not touched by switch_to. For a user mode helper, the gp value can be observed in user space after execve or possibly by other means.  [From the email thread]  The /* Kernel thread */ comment is somewhat inaccurate in that it is also used for user_mode_helper threads, which exec a user process, e.g. /sbin/init or when /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern is a pipe. Such threads do not have PF_KTHREAD set and are valid targets for ptrace etc. even before they exec.  childregs is the *user* context during syscall execution and it is observable from userspace in at least five ways:  1. kernel_execve does not currently clear integer registers, so the starting    register state for PID 1 and other user processes started by the kernel has    sp = user stack, gp = kernel __global_pointer$, all other integer registers    zeroed by the memset in the patch comment.     This is a bug in its own right, but I'm unwilling to bet that it is the only    way to exploit the issue addressed by this patch.  2. ptrace(PTRACE_GETREGSET): you can PTRACE_ATTACH to a user_mode_helper thread    before it execs, but ptrace requires SIGSTOP to be delivered which can only    happen at user/kernel boundaries.  3. /proc/*/task/*/syscall: this is perfectly happy to read pt_regs for    user_mode_helpers before the exec completes, but gp is not one of the    registers it returns.  4. PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_USER: LOCKDOWN_PERF normally prevents access to kernel    addresses via PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR, but due to this bug kernel addresses    are also exposed via PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_USER which is permitted under    LOCKDOWN_PERF. I have not attempted to write exploit code.  5. Much of the tracing infrastructure allows access to user registers. I have    not attempted to determine which forms of tracing allow access to user    registers without already allowing access to kernel registers.",
