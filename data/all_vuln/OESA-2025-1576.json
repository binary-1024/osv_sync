The version of the package reflects the version of ABI.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlibbpf: Use OPTS_SET() macro in bpf_xdp_query()\n\nWhen the feature_flags and xdp_zc_max_segs fields were added to the libbpf\nbpf_xdp_query_opts, the code writing them did not use the OPTS_SET() macro.\nThis causes libbpf to write to those fields unconditionally, which means\nthat programs compiled against an older version of libbpf (with a smaller\nsize of the bpf_xdp_query_opts struct) will have its stack corrupted by\nlibbpf writing out of bounds.\n\nThe patch adding the feature_flags field has an early bail out if the\nfeature_flags field is not part of the opts struct (via the OPTS_HAS)\nmacro, but the patch adding xdp_zc_max_segs does not. For consistency, this\nfix just changes the assignments to both fields to use the OPTS_SET()\nmacro.(CVE-2024-27050)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libbpf","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/libbpf&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.2-9.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libbpf-1.2.2-9.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","libbpf-debuginfo-1.2.2-9.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","libbpf-debugsource-1.2.2-9.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","libbpf-devel-1.2.2-9.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","libbpf-static-1.2.2-9.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["libbpf-1.2.2-9.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libbpf-1.2.2-9.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","libbpf-debuginfo-1.2.2-9.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","libbpf-debugsource-1.2.2-9.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","libbpf-devel-1.2.2-9.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","libbpf-static-1.2.2-9.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1576.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-1576"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27050"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
