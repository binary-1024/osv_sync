Otherwise, when device_register() return error and put_device() try to callback the release function, the below warning may happen.    ------------[ cut here ]------------   WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 4760 at drivers/base/core.c:2567 device_release+0x1bd/0x240 drivers/base/core.c:2567   Modules linked in:   CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 4760 Comm: syz.4.914 Not tainted 6.17.0-rc3+ #1 NONE   RIP: 0010:device_release+0x1bd/0x240 drivers/base/core.c:2567   Call Trace:    <TASK>    kobject_cleanup+0x136/0x410 lib/kobject.c:689    kobject_release lib/kobject.c:720 [inline]    kref_put include/linux/kref.h:65 [inline]    kobject_put+0xe9/0x130 lib/kobject.c:737    put_device+0x24/0x30 drivers/base/core.c:3797    pps_register_cdev+0x2da/0x370 drivers/pps/pps.c:402    pps_register_source+0x2f6/0x480 drivers/pps/kapi.c:108    pps_tty_open+0x190/0x310 drivers/pps/clients/pps-ldisc.c:57    tty_ldisc_open+0xa7/0x120 drivers/tty/tty_ldisc.c:432    tty_set_ldisc+0x333/0x780 drivers/tty/tty_ldisc.c:563    tiocsetd drivers/tty/tty_io.c:2429 [inline]    tty_ioctl+0x5d1/0x1700 drivers/tty/tty_io.c:2728    vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]    __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:598 [inline]    __se_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:584 [inline]    __x64_sys_ioctl+0x194/0x210 fs/ioctl.c:584    do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:63 [inline]    do_syscall_64+0x5f/0x2a0 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:94    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e    </TASK>  Before commit c79a39dc8d06 (\"pps: Fix a use-after-free\"), pps_register_cdev() call device_create() to create pps->dev, which will init dev->release to device_create_release().
