It is suitable for both desktop/laptop computers and embedded systems. Supplicant is the IEEE 802.1X/WPA component that is used in the client stations. It implements key negotiation with a WPA Authenticator and it controls the roaming and IEEE 802.11 authentication/association of the wlan driver.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nIn p2p_copy_client_info of p2p.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to remote code execution if the target device is performing a Wi-Fi Direct search, with no additional execution privileges needed.
