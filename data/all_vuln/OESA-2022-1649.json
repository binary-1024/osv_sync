  "details": "Apache XML Graphics Commons is a library that consists of several reusable components used by Apache Batik and Apache FOP. Many of these components can easily be used separately outside the domains of SVG and XSL-FO. You will find components such as a PDF library, an RTF library, Graphics2D implementations that let you generate PDF and PostScript files, and much more. The Apache\u2122 XML Graphics Commons project is part of the Apache\u2122 Software Foundation, which is a wider community of users and developers of open source projects.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nApache XmlGraphics Commons 2.4 and earlier is vulnerable to server-side request forgery, caused by improper input validation by the XMPParser. By using a specially-crafted argument, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the underlying server to make arbitrary GET requests. Users should upgrade to 2.6 or later.(CVE-2020-11988)",
