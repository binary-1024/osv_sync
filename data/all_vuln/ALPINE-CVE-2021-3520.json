An attacker who submits a crafted file to an application linked with lz4 may be able to trigger an integer overflow, leading to calling of memmove() on a negative size argument, causing an out-of-bounds write and/or a crash. The greatest impact of this flaw is to availability, with some potential impact to confidentiality and integrity as well.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"lz4","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/lz4?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.2-r1"}]}],"versions":["1.7.5-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.8.0-r1","1.8.1-r0","1.8.1.2-r0","1.8.2-r0","1.8.3-r0","1.8.3-r1","1.8.3-r2","1.9.1-r0","1.9.2-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-3520.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lz4","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/lz4?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.2-r1"}]}],"versions":["1.7.5-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.8.0-r1","1.8.1-r0","1.8.1.2-r0","1.8.2-r0","1.8.3-r0","1.8.3-r1","1.8.3-r2","1.9.1-r0","1.9.2-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-3520.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lz4","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/lz4?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.3-r1"}]}],"versions":["1.7.5-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.8.0-r1","1.8.1-r0","1.8.1.2-r0","1.8.2-r0","1.8.3-r0","1.8.3-r1","1.8.3-r2","1.9.1-r0","1.9.2-r0","1.9.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-3520.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lz4","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/lz4?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.3-r1"}]}],"versions":["1.7.5-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.8.0-r1","1.8.1-r0","1.8.1.2-r0","1.8.2-r0","1.8.3-r0","1.8.3-r1","1.8.3-r2","1.9.1-r0","1.9.2-r0","1.9.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-3520.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lz4","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/lz4?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.3-r1"}]}],"versions":["1.7.5-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.8.0-r1","1.8.1-r0","1.8.1.2-r0","1.8.2-r0","1.8.3-r0","1.8.3-r1","1.8.3-r2","1.9.1-r0","1.9.2-r0","1.9.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-3520.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lz4","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/lz4?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.3-r1"}]}],"versions":["1.7.5-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.8.0-r1","1.8.1-r0","1.8.1.2-r0","1.8.2-r0","1.8.3-r0","1.8.3-r1","1.8.3-r2","1.9.1-r0","1.9.2-r0","1.9.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-3520.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lz4","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/lz4?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.3-r1"}]}],"versions":["1.7.5-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.8.0-r1","1.8.1-r0","1.8.1.2-r0","1.8.2-r0","1.8.3-r0","1.8.3-r1","1.8.3-r2","1.9.1-r0","1.9.2-r0","1.9.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-3520.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lz4","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/lz4?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.3-r1"}]}],"versions":["1.7.5-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.8.0-r1","1.8.1-r0","1.8.1.2-r0","1.8.2-r0","1.8.3-r0","1.8.3-r1","1.8.3-r2","1.9.1-r0","1.9.2-r0","1.9.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-3520.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lz4","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/lz4?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.3-r1"}]}],"versions":["1.7.5-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.8.0-r1","1.8.1-r0","1.8.1.2-r0","1.8.2-r0","1.8.3-r0","1.8.3-r1","1.8.3-r2","1.9.1-r0","1.9.2-r0","1.9.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-3520.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lz4","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/lz4?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.3-r1"}]}],"versions":["1.7.5-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.8.0-r1","1.8.1-r0","1.8.1.2-r0","1.8.2-r0","1.8.3-r0","1.8.3-r1","1.8.3-r2","1.9.1-r0","1.9.2-r0","1.9.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-3520.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lz4","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/lz4?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.3-r1"}]}],"versions":["1.7.5-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.8.0-r1","1.8.1-r0","1.8.1.2-r0","1.8.2-r0","1.8.3-r0","1.8.3-r1","1.8.3-r2","1.9.1-r0","1.9.2-r0","1.9.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2021-3520.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2021-3520"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N
