(It is possible if tmp = 0b0xyz1xyz, where same literals mean same numbers) Also lm75[] does not serve a purpose anymore after switching to devm_i2c_new_dummy_device() in w83791d_detect_subclients().  The patch fixes possible NULL pointer dereference by removing lm75[].  Found by Linux Driver Verification project (linuxtesting.org).
