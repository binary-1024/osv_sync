{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2026-24401","published":"2026-01-24T02:15:48.760Z","modified":"2026-01-24T11:18:35.664030Z","details":"Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on a local network via the mDNS/DNS-SD protocol suite. In versions 0.9rc2 and below, avahi-daemon can be crashed via a segmentation fault by sending an unsolicited mDNS response containing a recursive CNAME record, where the alias and canonical name point to the same domain (e.g., \"h.local\" as a CNAME for \"h.local\"). This causes unbounded recursion in the lookup_handle_cname function, leading to stack exhaustion. The vulnerability affects record browsers where AVAHI_LOOKUP_USE_MULTICAST is set explicitly, which includes record browsers created by resolvers used by nss-mdns. This issue is patched in commit 78eab31128479f06e30beb8c1cbf99dd921e2524.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"avahi","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/avahi?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.8-10","0.8-11","0.8-12","0.8-13","0.8-14","0.8-15","0.8-16","0.8-17","0.8-5","0.8-5+deb11u1","0.8-5+deb11u2","0.8-5+deb11u3","0.8-6","0.8-7","0.8-8","0.8-9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-24401.json"}},{"package":{"name":"avahi","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/avahi?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.8-10","0.8-10+deb12u1","0.8-11","0.8-12","0.8-13","0.8-14","0.8-15","0.8-16","0.8-17"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-24401.json"}},{"package":{"name":"avahi","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/avahi?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.8-16","0.8-17"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-24401.json"}},{"package":{"name":"avahi","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/avahi?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.8-16","0.8-17"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-24401.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2026-24401"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
