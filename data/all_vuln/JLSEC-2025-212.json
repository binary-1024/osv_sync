The verification of X.509 certificates when matching the expected common name (the cn argument of mbedtls_x509_crt_verify) with the actual certificate name is mishandled: when the subjecAltName extension is present, the expected name is compared to any name in that extension regardless of its type. This means that an attacker could impersonate a 4-byte or 16-byte domain by getting a certificate for the corresponding IPv4 or IPv6 address (this would require the attacker to control that IP address, though).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"MbedTLS_jll","ecosystem":"Julia","purl":"pkg:julia/MbedTLS_jll?uuid=c8ffd9c3-330d-5841-b78e-0817d7145fa1"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.24.0+0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/SecurityAdvisories.jl/tree/generated/osv/2025/JLSEC-2025-212.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/issues/3498"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/releases/tag/v2.24.0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202301-08"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC-BY-4.0","sources":[{"html_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-36477","id":"CVE-2020-36477","imported":"2025-11-20T23:04:00.327Z","modified":"2024-11-21T05:29:38.067Z","published":"2021-08-23T02:15:07.043Z","url":"https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2020-36477"}]}}
