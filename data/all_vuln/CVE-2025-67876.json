A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM versions 6.4.0 and prior that allows a low-privilege user with the “Manage Groups” permission to inject persistent JavaScript into group role names. The payload is saved in the database and executed whenever any user (including administrators) views a page that displays that role, such as GroupView.php or PersonView.php. This allows full session hijacking and account takeover. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-67876.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67876.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/security/advisories/GHSA-j9gv-26c7-3qrh"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-67876"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67876.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:H/SI:H/SA:L"}]}
