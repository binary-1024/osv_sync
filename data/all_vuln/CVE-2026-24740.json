{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-24740","published":"2026-01-27T20:59:05.656Z","modified":"2026-01-30T22:49:43.606369Z","aliases":["GHSA-m855-r557-5rc5"],"summary":"Dozzle Agent Label-Based Access Control Bypass Allows Unauthorized Container Shell Access","details":"Dozzle is a realtime log viewer for docker containers. Prior to version 9.0.3, a flaw in Dozzle’s agent-backed shell endpoints allows a user restricted by label filters (for example, `label=env=dev`) to obtain an interactive root shell in out‑of‑scope containers (for example, `env=prod`) on the same agent host by directly targeting their container IDs. Version 9.0.3 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/amir20/dozzle","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"463fea4634d687f01563d297eb42f3f78f7cc0d6"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.1","v1.0.10","v1.0.11","v1.0.12","v1.0.13","v1.0.14","v1.0.15","v1.0.16","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v1.0.7","v1.0.8","v1.0.9","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.10.3","v1.11.0","v1.11.1","v1.11.2","v1.11.3","v1.11.4","v1.11.5","v1.11.6","v1.11.7","v1.11.8","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.12.2","v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.14.0","v1.15.0","v1.15.1","v1.15.2","v1.15.3","v1.15.4","v1.15.5","v1.15.6","v1.15.7","v1.15.8","v1.15.9","v1.16.0","v1.16.1","v1.16.2","v1.17.0","v1.17.2","v1.17.3","v1.18.0","v1.19.0","v1.19.1","v1.19.2","v1.19.3","v1.19.4","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.20.0","v1.20.1","v1.20.10","v1.20.11","v1.20.12","v1.20.13","v1.20.14","v1.20.15","v1.20.16","v1.20.17","v1.20.18","v1.20.19","v1.20.2","v1.20.20","v1.20.21","v1.20.3","v1.20.4","v1.20.5","v1.20.6","v1.20.7","v1.20.8","v1.20.9","v1.21.0","v1.21.1","v1.21.2","v1.21.5","v1.21.6","v1.21.7","v1.21.8","v1.21.9","v1.22.0","v1.22.1","v1.22.2","v1.22.3","v1.22.4","v1.22.5","v1.22.6","v1.22.7","v1.22.8","v1.23.0","v1.23.1","v1.23.2","v1.24.0","v1.24.1","v1.25.0","v1.25.1","v1.25.2","v1.25.3","v1.25.4","v1.25.5","v1.25.6","v1.26.0","v1.26.1","v1.26.2","v1.27.0","v1.27.1","v1.27.2","v1.27.3","v1.28.0","v1.29.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.4.6","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.10","v1.5.11","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.5.5","v1.5.6","v1.5.7","v1.5.8","v1.5.9","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.6.5","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.7.4","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.8.3","v1.8.4","v1.8.5","v1.8.6","v1.8.7","v1.9.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.1.4","v2.1.5","v2.2.0","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.1.2","v3.10.0","v3.10.1","v3.10.2","v3.11.0","v3.12.0","v3.12.1","v3.12.10","v3.12.11","v3.12.12","v3.12.13","v3.12.14","v3.12.2","v3.12.3","v3.12.4","v3.12.5","v3.12.6","v3.12.7","v3.12.8","v3.12.9","v3.13.0","v3.13.1","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.2.2","v3.2.3","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.4.0","v3.4.1","v3.4.2","v3.4.3","v3.4.4","v3.4.5","v3.4.6","v3.4.7","v3.4.8","v3.5.0","v3.5.1","v3.5.10","v3.5.11","v3.5.2","v3.5.3","v3.5.4","v3.5.5","v3.5.6","v3.5.7","v3.5.8","v3.5.9","v3.6.0","v3.6.1","v3.6.2","v3.6.3","v3.6.4","v3.6.5","v3.6.6","v3.6.7","v3.7.0","v3.7.1","v3.8.0","v3.8.1","v3.8.2","v3.8.3","v3.8.4","v3.8.5","v3.9.0","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.1.2","v4.1.3","v4.1.4","v4.1.5","v4.1.6","v4.1.7","v4.1.8","v4.1.9","v4.10.0","v4.10.1","v4.10.10","v4.10.11","v4.10.12","v4.10.13","v4.10.14","v4.10.15","v4.10.16","v4.10.17","v4.10.18","v4.10.19","v4.10.2","v4.10.20","v4.10.21","v4.10.22","v4.10.23","v4.10.24","v4.10.25","v4.10.26","v4.10.3","v4.10.4","v4.10.5","v4.10.6","v4.10.7","v4.10.8","v4.10.9","v4.11.0","v4.11.1","v4.11.2","v4.11.3","v4.11.4","v4.11.5","v4.2.0","v4.2.1","v4.2.2","v4.2.3","v4.3.0","v4.4.0","v4.4.1","v4.5.0","v4.6.0","v4.6.1","v4.6.2","v4.6.3","v4.6.4","v4.6.5","v4.7.0","v4.7.1","v4.7.2","v4.7.3","v4.7.4","v4.7.5","v4.8.0","v4.8.1","v4.8.2","v4.9.0","v4.9.1","v4.9.2","v4.9.3","v4.9.4","v5.0.0","v5.0.0-beta.0","v5.0.1","v5.0.10","v5.0.2","v5.0.3","v5.0.4","v5.0.5","v5.0.6","v5.0.7","v5.0.8","v5.0.9","v5.1.0","v5.1.1","v5.1.2","v5.2.0","v5.2.1","v5.2.2","v5.2.3","v5.3.0","v5.3.1","v5.4.0","v5.4.1","v5.4.2","v5.4.3","v5.4.4","v5.4.5","v5.5.0","v5.6.0","v5.6.1","v5.7.0","v5.7.1","v5.7.2","v5.7.3","v5.8.0","v5.8.1","v6.0.0","v6.0.1","v6.0.2","v6.0.3","v6.0.4","v6.0.5","v6.0.6","v6.0.7","v6.0.8","v6.1.0","v6.1.1","v6.2.0","v6.2.1","v6.2.2","v6.2.3","v6.2.4","v6.2.5","v6.2.6","v6.2.7","v6.3.0","v6.3.1","v6.4.0","v6.4.1","v6.4.2","v6.4.3","v6.4.4","v6.4.5","v6.4.6","v6.5.0","v6.5.1","v6.5.2","v6.6.0","v6.6.1","v6.6.2","v6.6.3","v7.0.0","v7.0.1","v7.0.2","v7.0.3","v7.0.4","v7.0.5","v7.0.6","v7.0.7","v8.0.0","v8.0.1","v8.0.2","v8.0.3","v8.0.4","v8.0.5","v8.0.6","v8.0.7","v8.1.0","v8.1.1","v8.1.2","v8.1.3","v8.1.4","v8.1.5","v8.10.0","v8.10.1","v8.10.2","v8.10.3","v8.10.4","v8.10.5","v8.10.6","v8.10.7","v8.11.0","v8.11.1","v8.11.2","v8.11.3","v8.11.4","v8.11.5","v8.11.6","v8.11.7","v8.11.8","v8.11.9","v8.12.0","v8.12.1","v8.12.10","v8.12.11","v8.12.12","v8.12.13","v8.12.14","v8.12.15","v8.12.16","v8.12.17","v8.12.18","v8.12.19","v8.12.2","v8.12.20","v8.12.21","v8.12.3","v8.12.4","v8.12.5","v8.12.6","v8.12.7","v8.12.8","v8.12.9","v8.13.0","v8.13.1","v8.13.10","v8.13.11","v8.13.12","v8.13.13","v8.13.14","v8.13.2","v8.13.3","v8.13.4","v8.13.5","v8.13.6","v8.13.7","v8.13.8","v8.13.9","v8.14.0","v8.14.1","v8.14.10","v8.14.11","v8.14.12","v8.14.2","v8.14.3","v8.14.4","v8.14.5","v8.14.6","v8.14.7","v8.14.8","v8.14.9","v8.2.0","v8.2.1","v8.3.0","v8.4.0","v8.4.1","v8.4.2","v8.4.3","v8.4.4","v
