Commit    662a0221893a3d (\"x86/entry: Fix AC assertion\")  changed the warning to only fire if the CPU supports SMAP.  However, the warning can still trigger on a machine that supports SMAP but where it's disabled in the kernel config and when running the syscall_nt selftest, for example:    ------------[ cut here ]------------   WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 49 at irqentry_enter_from_user_mode   CPU: 0 PID: 49 Comm: init Tainted: G                T 5.15.0-rc4+ #98 e6202628ee053b4f310759978284bd8bb0ce6905   Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.10.2-1ubuntu1 04/01/2014   RIP: 0010:irqentry_enter_from_user_mode   ...   Call Trace:    ? irqentry_enter    ? exc_general_protection    ? asm_exc_general_protection    ? asm_exc_general_protectio  IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_X86_SMAP) could be added to the warning condition, but even this would not be enough in case SMAP is disabled at boot time with the \"nosmap\" parameter.  To be consistent with \"nosmap\" behaviour, clear X86_FEATURE_SMAP when !CONFIG_X86_SMAP.  Found using entry-fuzz + satrandconfig.
