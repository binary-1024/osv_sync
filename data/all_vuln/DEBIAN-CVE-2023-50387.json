One of the concerns is that, when there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the protocol specification implies that an algorithm must evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG records.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"bind9","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/bind9?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:9.16.48-1"}]}],"versions":["1:9.16.15-1","1:9.16.21-1","1:9.16.21-1+hurd.1","1:9.16.22-1~deb11u1","1:9.16.22-1~deb11u1~bpo10+1","1:9.16.27-1~deb11u1","1:9.16.27-1~deb11u1~bpo10+1","1:9.16.33-1~deb11u1","1:9.16.37-1~deb11u1","1:9.16.42-1~deb11u1","1:9.16.44-1~deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not
