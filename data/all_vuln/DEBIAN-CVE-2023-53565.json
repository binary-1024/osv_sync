If a user tries to manually bind the driver from sysfs then the sdio /    pcie / usb probe() function gets called with NULL as id argument.  1. Is being hit by users causing the following oops on resume and causing wifi to stop working:  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000018 <snip> Hardware name: Dell Inc.

In the PCI and USB cases try a manual lookup of the id so that manually binding the driver through sysfs and more importantly brcmf_pcie_probe() on resume will work.  For the SDIO case there is no helper to do a manual sdio_device_id lookup, so just directly error out on a NULL id there.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.3.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53565.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.3.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53565.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-53565"}]}
