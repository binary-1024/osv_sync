It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++ (or other languages, depending on the chosen implementation). Python is also usable as an extension language for applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use scripting or automation interfaces.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA vulnerability has been found in the CPython `venv` module and CLI where path names provided when creating a virtual environment were not quoted properly, allowing the creator to inject commands into virtual environment &quot;activation&quot; scripts (ie &quot;source venv/bin/activate&quot;). This means that attacker-controlled virtual environments are able to run commands when the virtual environment is activated. Virtual environments which are not created by an attacker or which aren&apos;t activated before being used (ie &quot;./venv/bin/python&quot;) are not affected.(CVE-2024-9287)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python3&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.9.9-35.oe2203sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python3-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","python3-debug-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","python3-devel-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","python3-unversioned-command-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["python3-help-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["python3-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python3-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","python3-debug-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","python3-devel-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","python3-unversioned-command-3.9.9-35.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-2484.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2024-2484"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9287"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
