The latest version of the TIFF specification is available on-line in several different formats.And contains command-line programs for manipulating TIFF format image files using the libtiff library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nNull source pointer passed as an argument to memcpy() function within TIFFReadDirectory() in tif_dirread.c in libtiff versions from 4.0 to 4.3.0 could lead to Denial of Service via crafted TIFF file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, a fix is available with commit 561599c.(CVE-2022-0562)\r\n\r\nNull source pointer passed as an argument to memcpy() function within TIFFFetchStripThing() in tif_dirread.c in libtiff versions from 3.9.0 to 4.3.0 could lead to Denial of Service via crafted TIFF file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit eecb0712.(CVE-2022-0561)\r\n\r\nLibTIFF 4.3.0 has an out-of-bounds read in _TIFFmemcpy in tif_unix.c in certain situations involving a custom tag and 0x0200 as the second word of the DE field.(CVE-2022-22844)\r\n\r\nA heap buffer overflow in ExtractImageSection function in tiffcrop.c in libtiff library Version 4.3.0 allows attacker to trigger unsafe or out of bounds memory access via crafted TIFF image file which could result into application crash, potential information disclosure or any other context-dependent impact(CVE-2022-0891)",
