However, if we abort the probe quite early then during unwind we might try to destroy the workqueue while there is still a pending delayed work that attempts to restart itself which triggers a WARN.  This was recently observed during unsuccessful VF initialization:   [ ] xe 0000:00:02.1: probe with driver xe failed with error -62  [ ] ------------[ cut here ]------------  [ ] workqueue: cannot queue safe_mode_worker_func [xe] on wq xe-g2h-wq  [ ] WARNING: CPU: 9 PID: 0 at kernel/workqueue.c:2257 __queue_work+0x287/0x710  [ ] RIP: 0010:__queue_work+0x287/0x710  [ ] Call Trace:  [ ]  delayed_work_timer_fn+0x19/0x30  [ ]  call_timer_fn+0xa1/0x2a0  Exit the CT safe mode on unwind to avoid that warning.
