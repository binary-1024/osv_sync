If it hasn't found any memory it will return 0, allowing other memory setup mechanisms to carry on.  Previously early_init_dt_scan_memory always returned 0 without distinguishing between any kind of memory setup being done or not. Any code path after the early_init_dt_scan memory call in the ramips plat_mem_setup code wouldn't be executed anymore. Making early_init_dt_scan_memory the only way to initialize the memory.  Some boards, including my mt7621 based Cudy X6 board, depend on memory initialization being done via the soc_info.mem_detect function pointer. Those wouldn't be able to obtain memory and panic the kernel during early bootup with the message \"early_init_dt_alloc_memory_arch: Failed to allocate 12416 bytes align=0x40\".","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53341.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53341.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53341.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-53341"}]}
