  "details": "The Linux Kernel, the operating system core itself.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn improper validation of an array index and out of bounds memory read in the Linux kernel s Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) functionality was found in the way users call ioctl CMTPCONNADD. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or starve the resources causing denial of service.(CVE-2021-3896)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability.(CVE-2021-3760)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel s CAPI over Bluetooth connection code. An attacker with a local account can escalate privileges when CAPI (ISDN) hardware connection fails.(CVE-2021-34981)\r\n\r\nSpecifically timed and handcrafted traffic can cause internal errors in a WLAN device that lead to improper layer 2 Wi-Fi encryption with a consequent possibility of information disclosure over the air for a discrete set of traffic&apos; in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice &amp; Music, Snapdragon Wearables, Snapdragon Wired Infrastructure and Networking in APQ8053, IPQ4019, IPQ8064, MSM8909W, MSM8996AU, QCA9531, QCN5502, QCS405, SDX20, SM6150, SM7150(CVE-2020-3702)\r\n\r\nUAF in Android ION memory allocator.(CVE-2021-0929)\r\n\r\nA flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source port randomization are indirectly affected as well.(CVE-2021-20322)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in s390 eBPF JIT in bpf_jit_insn in arch/s390/net/bpf_jit_comp.c in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with special user privilege can circumvent the verifier and may lead to a confidentiality problem.(CVE-2021-20320)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c.(CVE-2021-43389)\n\nUse-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel exploitable by a local attacker due to reuse of a DCCP socket with an attached dccps_hc_tx_ccid object as a listener after being released.(CVE-2020-16119)",
