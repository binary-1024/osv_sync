The external_oauth2_token middleware fails to sanitize incoming authentication headers before processing OAuth 2.0 tokens. By sending forged identity headers such as X-Is-Admin-Project, X-Roles, or X-User-Id, an authenticated attacker may escalate privileges or impersonate other users. All deployments using the external_oauth2_token middleware are affected.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-keystonemiddleware","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-keystonemiddleware?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"10.9.0-2+deb13u1"}]}],"versions":["10.9.0-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22797.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-keystonemiddleware","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-keystonemiddleware?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["10.12.0-1","10.12.0-2","10.12.0-3","10.9.0-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22797.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2026-22797"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
