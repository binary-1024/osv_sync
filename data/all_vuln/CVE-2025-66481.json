The recent security patch for MermaidArtifact.vue is insufficient and can be bypassed using unquoted HTML attributes combined with HTML entity encoding. Remote Code Execution is possible on the victim's machine via the electron.ipcRenderer interface, bypassing the regex filter intended to strip dangerous attributes. There is no fix at time of publication.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/thinkinaixyz/deepchat","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"b18029b23487bee67bedc1bee7edd978afcdb112"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.10","v0.0.11","v0.0.12","v0.0.13","v0.0.14","v0.0.15","v0.0.16","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.9","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.2.0","v0.2.0-1","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.3-1","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.2.6","v0.2.7","v0.2.8","v0.2.9","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.3.5","v0.3.6","v0.3.7","v0.3.9","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.5","v0.4.6","v0.4.8","v0.4.9","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","workflow-19022687016"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66481.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66481.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ThinkInAIXYZ/deepchat/security/advisories/GHSA-h9f5-7hhf-fqm4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66481"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79","CWE-80","CWE-94"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66481.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
