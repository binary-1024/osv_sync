The primary goal is to provide an API to which software developers may code and be assured of predictable if not identical behaviour regardless of the platform on which their software is built, relieving them of the need to code special-case conditions to work around or take advantage of platform-specific deficiencies or features.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nInteger Overflow or Wraparound vulnerability in apr_encode functions of Apache Portable Runtime (APR) allows an attacker to write beyond bounds of a buffer.
