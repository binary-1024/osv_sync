If any of these configuration files has an embedded `NULL` character as the first character in a new line, it can lead to attempting to read memory prior to the start of the given buffer which may result in a crash. This issue is fixed in c-ares 1.27.0. No known workarounds exist.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"c-ares","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/c-ares?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.19.1-r1"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-r0","1.10.0-r1","1.11.0-r0","1.12.0-r0","1.13.0-r0","1.13.0-r1","1.14.0-r0","1.15.0-r0","1.15.0-r1","1.16.0-r0","1.16.1-r0","1.17.1-r0","1.17.1-r1","1.17.2-r0","1.18.1-r0","1.19.1-r0","1.6.0-r0","1.6.0-r1","1.7.0-r0","1.7.0-r1","1.7.3-r0","1.7.4-r0","1.7.4-r1","1.7.4-r2","1.7.5-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.9.0-r0","1.9.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-25629.json"}},{"package":{"name":"c-ares","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/c-ares?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.19.1-r1"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-r0","1.10.0-r1","1.11.0-r0","1.12.0-r0","1.13.0-r0","1.13.0-r1","1.14.0-r0","1.15.0-r0","1.15.0-r1","1.16.0-r0","1.16.1-r0","1.17.1-r0","1.17.1-r1","1.17.2-r0","1.18.1-r0","1.18.1-r1","1.19.1-r0","1.6.0-r0","1.6.0-r1","1.7.0-r0","1.7.0-r1","1.7.3-r0","1.7.4-r0","1.7.4-r1","1.7.4-r2","1.7.5-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.9.0-r0","1.9.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-25629.json"}},{"package":{"name":"c-ares","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/c-ares?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.19.1-r1"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-r0","1.10.0-r1","1.11.0-r0","1.12.0-r0","1.13.0-r0","1.13.0-r1","1.14.0-r0","1.15.0-r0","1.15.0-r1","1.16.0-r0","1.16.1-r0","1.17.1-r0","1.17.1-r1","1.17.2-r0","1.18.1-r0","1.18.1-r1","1.19.0-r0","1.19.0-r1","1.19.0-r2","1.19.0-r3","1.19.1-r0","1.6.0-r0","1.6.0-r1","1.7.0-r0","1.7.0-r1","1.7.3-r0","1.7.4-r0","1.7.4-r1","1.7.4-r2","1.7.5-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.9.0-r0","1.9.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-25629.json"}},{"package":{"name":"c-ares","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/c-ares?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.27.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-r0","1.10.0-r1","1.11.0-r0","1.12.0-r0","1.13.0-r0","1.13.0-r1","1.14.0-r0","1.15.0-r0","1.15.0-r1","1.16.0-r0","1.16.1-r0","1.17.1-r0","1.17.1-r1","1.17.2-r0","1.18.1-r0","1.18.1-r1","1.19.0-r0","1.19.0-r1","1.19.0-r2","1.19.0-r3","1.19.0-r4","1.19.1-r0","1.19.1-r1","1.20.1-r0","1.21.0-r0","1.22.0-r0","1.22.1-r0","1.24.0-r0","1.24.0-r1","1.6.0-r0","1.6.0-r1","1.7.0-r0","1.7.0-r1","1.7.3-r0","1.7.4-r0","1.7.4-r1","1.7.4-r2","1.7.5-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.9.0-r0","1.9.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-25629.json"}},{"package":{"name":"c-ares","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/c-ares?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.27.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-r0","1.10.0-r1","1.11.0-r0","1.12.0-r0","1.13.0-r0","1.13.0-r1","1.14.0-r0","1.15.0-r0","1.15.0-r1","1.16.0-r0","1.16.1-r0","1.17.1-r0","1.17.1-r1","1.17.2-r0","1.18.1-r0","1.18.1-r1","1.19.0-r0","1.19.0-r1","1.19.0-r2","1.19.0-r3","1.19.0-r4","1.19.1-r0","1.19.1-r1","1.20.1-r0","1.21.0-r0","1.22.0-r0","1.22.1-r0","1.23.0-r0","1.24.0-r0","1.25.0-r0","1.25.0-r1","1.26.0-r0","1.6.0-r0","1.6.0-r1","1.7.0-r0","1.7.0-r1","1.7.3-r0","1.7.4-r0","1.7.4-r1","1.7.4-r2","1.7.5-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.9.0-r0","1.9.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-25629.json"}},{"package":{"name":"c-ares","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/c-ares?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.27.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-r0","1.10.0-r1","1.11.0-r0","1.12.0-r0","1.13.0-r0","1.13.0-r1","1.14.0-r0","1.15.0-r0","1.15.0-r1","1.16.0-r0","1.16.1-r0","1.17.1-r0","1.17.1-r1","1.17.2-r0","1.18.1-r0","1.18.1-r1","1.19.0-r0","1.19.0-r1","1.19.0-r2","1.19.0-r3","1.19.0-r4","1.19.1-r0","1.19.1-r1","1.20.1-r0","1.21.0-r0","1.22.0-r0","1.22.1-r0","1.23.0-r0","1.24.0-r0","1.25.0-r0","1.25.0-r1","1.26.0-r0","1.6.0-r0","1.6.0-r1","1.7.0-r0","1.7.0-r1","1.7.3-r0","1.7.4-r0","1.7.4-r1","1.7.4-r2","1.7.5-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.9.0-r0","1.9.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-25629.json"}},{"package":{"name":"c-ares","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/c-ares?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.27.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-r0","1.10.0-r1","1.11.0-r0","1.12.0-r0","1.13.0-r0","1.13.0-r1","1.14.0-r0","1.15.0-r0","1.15.0-r1","1.16.0-r0","1.16.1-r0","1.17.1-r0","1.17.1-r1","1.17.2-r0","1.18.1-r0","1.18.1-r1","1.19.0-r0","1.19.0-r1","1.19.0-r2","1.19.0-r3","1.19.0-r4","1.19.1-r0","1.19.1-r1","1.20.1-r0","1.21.0-r0","1.22.0-r0","1.22.1-r0","1.23.0-r0","1.24.0-r
