  "details": "A crafted S/MIME message consisting of an inner encryption layer and an outer SignedData layer was shown as having a valid digital signature, although the signer might have had no access to the contents of the encrypted message, and might have stripped a different signature from the encrypted message. Previous versions had only suppressed showing a digital signature for messages with an outer multipart/signed layer. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.1.1.",
