{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-25116","published":"2026-01-29T21:49:49.450Z","modified":"2026-01-30T02:56:21.852687Z","aliases":["GHSA-mwg8-x997-cqw6"],"summary":"Runtipi vulnerable to unauthenticated docker-compose.yml Overwrite via Path Traversal","details":"Runtipi is a personal homeserver orchestrator. Starting in version 4.5.0 and prior to version 4.7.2, an unauthenticated Path Traversal vulnerability in the `UserConfigController` allows any remote user to overwrite the system's `docker-compose.yml` configuration file. By exploiting insecure URN parsing, an attacker can replace the primary stack configuration with a malicious one, resulting in full Remote Code Execution (RCE) and host filesystem compromise the next time the instance is restarted by the operator. Version 4.7.2 fixes the vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/runtipi/runtipi","events":[{"introduced":"93120bb092e54f6ceda4c58bb181238669913165"},{"fixed":"6f4ad632cb23ffa2c1ccdce0e5fd076cad6394f5"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"4.5.0"},{"fixed":"4.7.2"}]}}],"versions":["e2e","nightly","v4.5.0","v4.5.1","v4.5.2","v4.5.2-alpha.1","v4.5.3","v4.5.4","v4.5.5","v4.6.0","v4.6.0-beta.1","v4.6.0-beta.2","v4.6.1","v4.6.2","v4.6.3","v4.6.3-beta.1","v4.6.3-beta.2","v4.6.4","v4.6.5","v4.7.0","v4.7.0-alpha.1","v4.7.0-alpha.2","v4.7.0-beta.1","v4.7.0-beta.2","v4.7.0-beta.3","v4.7.1","v4.7.1-beta.1","v4.7.2-beta.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-25116.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/25xxx/CVE-2026-25116.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/runtipi/runtipi/releases/tag/v4.7.2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/runtipi/runtipi/security/advisories/GHSA-mwg8-x997-cqw6"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-25116"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-22","CWE-306"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/25xxx/CVE-2026-25116.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L"}]}
