This flaw stems from a programming error where the gettext command remains registered in memory after its module is unloaded. An attacker can exploit this condition by invoking the orphaned command, causing the application to access a memory location that is no longer valid. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause grub to crash, leading to a Denial of Service. Possible data integrity or confidentiality compromise is not discarded.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"grub2","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/grub2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.04-20","2.06-1","2.06-10","2.06-11","2.06-12","2.06-13","2.06-13+hurd.1","2.06-13+hurd.2","2.06-14","2.06-2","2.06-2+hurd.1","2.06-2+hurd.2","2.06-2+hurd.3","2.06-2+hurd.4","2.06-2+hurd.5","2.06-2+hurd.6","2.06-2+hurd.7","2.06-2+hurd.8","2.06-3","2.06-3~deb10u1","2.06-3~deb10u2","2.06-3~deb10u3","2.06-3~deb10u4","2.06-3~deb11u1","2.06-3~deb11u2","2.06-3~deb11u4","2.06-3~deb11u5","2.06-3~deb11u6","2.06-4","2.06-4+hurd.1","2.06-5","2.06-6","2.06-7","2.06-8","2.06-8+hurd.1","2.06-8.1","2.06-9","2.12-1","2.12-1.1","2.12-1~bpo12+1","2.12-2","2.12-2~deb13u1","2.12-3","2.12-4","2.12-5","2.12-5+hurd.1","2.12-6","2.12-7","2.12-8","2.12-9","2.12-9+hurd.1","2.12~rc1-1","2.12~rc1-10","2.12~rc1-11","2.12~rc1-12","2.12~rc1-13","2.12~rc1-2","2.12~rc1-3","2.12~rc1-6","2.12~rc1-7","2.12~rc1-8","2.12~rc1-9","2.14~git20250718.0e36779-1","2.14~git20250718.0e36779-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-61662.json"}},{"package":{"name":"grub2","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/grub2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.06-13","2.06-13+deb12u1","2.06-13+hurd.1","2.06-13+hurd.2","2.06-14","2.12-1","2.12-1.1","2.12-1~bpo12+1","2.12-2","2.12-2~deb13u1","2.12-3","2.12-4","2.12-5","2.12-5+hurd.1","2.12-6","2.12-7","2.12-8","2.12-9","2.12-9+hurd.1","2.12~rc1-1","2.12~rc1-10","2.12~rc1-11","2.12~rc1-12","2.12~rc1-13","2.12~rc1-2","2.12~rc1-3","2.12~rc1-6","2.12~rc1-7","2.12~rc1-8","2.12~rc1-9","2.14~git20250718.0e36779-1","2.14~git20250718.0e36779-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-61662.json"}},{"package":{"name":"grub2","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/grub2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.12-9","2.12-9+hurd.1","2.14~git20250718.0e36779-1","2.14~git20250718.0e36779-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-61662.json"}},{"package":{"name":"grub2","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/grub2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.12-9","2.12-9+hurd.1","2.14~git20250718.0e36779-1","2.14~git20250718.0e36779-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-61662.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-61662"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
