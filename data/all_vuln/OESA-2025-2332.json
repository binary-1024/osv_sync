It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++ (or other languages, depending on the chosen implementation). Python is also usable as an extension language for applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use scripting or automation interfaces.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Python CPython up to 3.14.0b1 (Programming Language Software).CWE is classifying the issue as CWE-22. The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.This is going to have an impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.Upgrading to version 3.14.0b2 eliminates this vulnerability. Applying a patch is able to eliminate this problem. The bugfix is ready for download at github.com. The best possible mitigation is suggested to be upgrading to the latest version.(CVE-2025-4517)\n\nThe html.parser.HTMLParser class had worse-case quadratic complexity when processing certain crafted malformed inputs potentially leading to amplified denial-of-service.(CVE-2025-6069)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python3&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.9.9-42.oe2203sp3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python3-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","python3-debug-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","python3-devel-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","python3-unversioned-command-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["python3-help-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp3.noarch.rpm"],"src":["python3-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp3.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python3-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","python3-debug-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","python3-devel-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","python3-unversioned-command-3.9.9-42.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2332.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2332"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4517"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-6069"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Critical"}}
