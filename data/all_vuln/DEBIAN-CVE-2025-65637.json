Due to limitations in the internal bufio.Scanner, the read fails with \"token too long\" and the writer pipe is closed, leaving Writer() unusable and causing application unavailability (DoS). This affects versions < 1.8.3, 1.9.0, and 1.9.2. The issue is fixed in 1.8.3, 1.9.1, and 1.9.3+, where the input is chunked and the writer continues to function even if an error is logged.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"golang-logrus","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-logrus?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.7.0-2","1.9.0-1","1.9.0-1+hurd.1","1.9.3-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-65637.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-logrus","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-logrus?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.9.0-1","1.9.0-1+hurd.1","1.9.3-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-65637.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-logrus","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-logrus?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.9.0-1","1.9.0-1+hurd.1","1.9.3-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-65637.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-logrus","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-logrus?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.3-1"}]}],"versions":["1.9.0-1","1.9.0-1+hurd.1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-65637.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-65637"}]}
