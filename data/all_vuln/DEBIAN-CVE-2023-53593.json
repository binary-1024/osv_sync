{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53593","published":"2025-10-04T16:15:55Z","modified":"2025-10-05T08:09:34.587381Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-53593"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cifs: Release folio lock on fscache read hit.  Under the current code, when cifs_readpage_worker is called, the call contract is that the callee should unlock the page. This is documented in the read_folio section of Documentation/filesystems/vfs.rst as:  > The filesystem should unlock the folio once the read has completed, > whether it was successful or not.  Without this change, when fscache is in use and cache hit occurs during a read, the page lock is leaked, producing the following stack on subsequent reads (via mmap) to the page:  $ cat /proc/3890/task/12864/stack [<0>] folio_wait_bit_common+0x124/0x350 [<0>] filemap_read_folio+0xad/0xf0 [<0>] filemap_fault+0x8b1/0xab0 [<0>] __do_fault+0x39/0x150 [<0>] do_fault+0x25c/0x3e0 [<0>] __handle_mm_fault+0x6ca/0xc70 [<0>] handle_mm_fault+0xe9/0x350 [<0>] do_user_addr_fault+0x225/0x6c0 [<0>] exc_page_fault+0x84/0x1b0 [<0>] asm_exc_page_fault+0x27/0x30  This requires a reboot to resolve; it is a deadlock.  Note however that the call to cifs_readpage_from_fscache does mark the page clean, but does not free the folio lock. This happens in __cifs_readpage_from_fscache on success. Releasing the lock at that point however is not appropriate as cifs_readahead also calls cifs_readpage_from_fscache and *does* unconditionally release the lock after its return. This change therefore effectively makes cifs_readpage_worker work like cifs_readahead.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.197-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.103-1","5.10.103-1~bpo10+1","5.10.106-1","5.10.113-1","5.10.120-1","5.10.120-1~bpo10+1","5.10.127-1","5.10.127-2","5.10.127-2~bpo10+1","5.10.136-1","5.10.140-1","5.10.148-1","5.10.149-1","5.10.149-2","5.10.158-1","5.10.158-2","5.10.162-1","5.10.178-1","5.10.178-2","5.10.178-3","5.10.179-1","5.10.179-2","5.10.179-3","5.10.179-4","5.10.179-5","5.10.191-1","5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1","5.10.92-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53593.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.52-1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.27-1","6.1.37-1","6.1.38-1","6.1.38-2","6.1.38-2~bpo11+1","6.1.38-3","6.1.38-4","6.1.38-4~bpo11+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53593.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.4.13-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53593.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.4.13-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53593.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-53593"}]}
