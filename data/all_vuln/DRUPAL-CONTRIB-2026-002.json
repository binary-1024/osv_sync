A user with the ability to delegate a role is also able to assign the administrator role, including to their own user.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have access to a view of users with the Views Bulk Operations module enabled.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/role_delegation","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/role_delegation"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.3.0"},{"fixed":"1.5.0"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":">=1.3.0 <1.5.0"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":">=1.3.0 <1.5.0","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/role_delegation/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2026-002.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2026-002"}],"credits":[{"name":"Drew Webber (mcdruid)","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/u/mcdruid"]}]}
