Versions prior to 10.16.1 have a ReDOS bug found within the figure caption extension (`pymdownx.blocks.caption`). In systems that take unchecked user content, this could cause long hanges when processing the data if a malicious payload was crafted. This issue is patched in Release 10.16.1. As a workaround, those who process unknown user content without timeouts or other safeguards in place to prevent really large, malicious content being aimed at systems may avoid the use of `pymdownx.blocks.caption` until they're able to upgrade.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"pymdown-extensions","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/pymdown-extensions@9.5-5?arch=source&distro=noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["9.5-2","9.5-4","9.5-5"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"python3-pymdownx","binary_version":"9.5-5"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-68142.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pymdown-extensions","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.10","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/pymdown-extensions@10.13-3?arch=source&distro=questing"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["10.13-1","10.13-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"python3-pymdownx","binary_version":"10.13-3"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-68142.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-68142"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68142"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions/commit/b50d15a56850ed1408a284bba81cc019c6bd72e8"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions/security/advisories/GHSA-r6h4-mm7h-8pmq"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://pypi.org/project/pymdown-extensions/10.16.1"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
