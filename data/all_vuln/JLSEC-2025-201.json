An attacker that can get precise enough side-channel measurements can recover the long-term ECDSA private key by (1) reconstructing the projective coordinate of the result of scalar multiplication by exploiting side channels in the conversion to affine coordinates; (2) using an attack described by Naccache, Smart, and Stern in 2003 to recover a few bits of the ephemeral scalar from those projective coordinates via several measurements; and (3) using a lattice attack to get from there to the long-term ECDSA private key used for the signatures. Typically an attacker would have sufficient access when attacking an SGX enclave and controlling the untrusted OS.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"MbedTLS_jll","ecosystem":"Julia","purl":"pkg:julia/MbedTLS_jll?uuid=c8ffd9c3-330d-5841-b78e-0817d7145fa1"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.16.6+0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/SecurityAdvisories.jl/tree/generated/osv/2025/JLSEC-2025-201.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00036.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FCWN5HIF4CJ2LZTOMEBJ7Q4IMMV7ZU2V/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZNOS2IIBH5WNJXZUV546PY7666DE7Y3L/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://tls.mbed.org/tech-updates/releases/mbedtls-2.16.6-and-2.7.15-released"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://tls.mbed.org/tech-updates/security-advisories"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://tls.mbed.org/tech-updates/security-advisories/mbedtls-security-advisory-2020-04"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC-BY-4.0","sources":[{"html_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10932","id":"CVE-2020-10932","imported":"2025-11-20T23:04:00.266Z","modified":"2024-11-21T04:56:23.837Z","published":"2020-04-15T14:15:20.123Z","url":"https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2020-10932"}]}}
