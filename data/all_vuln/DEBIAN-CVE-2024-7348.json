The attack involves replacing another relation type with a view or foreign table. The attack requires waiting for pg_dump to start, but winning the race condition is trivial if the attacker retains an open transaction. Versions before PostgreSQL 16.4, 15.8, 14.13, 13.16, and 12.20 are affected.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"postgresql-13","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/postgresql-13?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"13.16-0+deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["13.10-0+deb11u1","13.11-0+deb11u1","13.12-0+deb11u1","13.13-0+deb11u1","13.14-0+deb11u1","13.15-0+deb11u1","13.3-1","13.4-0+deb11u1","13.4-1","13.4-2","13.4-3","13.5-0+deb11u1","13.7-0+deb11u1","13.8-0+deb11u1","13.9-0+deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-7348.json"}},{"package":{"name":"postgresql-15","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/postgresql-15?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"15.8-0+deb12u1"}]}],"versions":["15.3-0+deb12u1","15.3-1","15.4-0+deb12u1","15.4-1","15.4-2","15.4-3","15.5-0+deb12u1","15.6-0+deb12u1","15.7-0+deb12u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-7348.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-7348"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
