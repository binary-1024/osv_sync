  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Add more checks for DSC / HUBP ONO guarantees  [WHY] For non-zero DSC instances it's possible that the HUBP domain required to drive it for sequential ONO ASICs isn't met, potentially causing the logic to the tile to enter an undefined state leading to a system hang.  [HOW] Add more checks to ensure that the HUBP domain matching the DSC instance is appropriately powered.  (cherry picked from commit da63df07112e5a9857a8d2aaa04255c4206754ec)",
