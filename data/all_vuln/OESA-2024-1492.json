  "details": "Mate-document-viewer is simple document viewer. It can display and print Portable Document Format (PDF), PostScript (PS), Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), DVI, DJVU, epub and XPS files. When supported by the document format, mate-document-viewer allows searching for text, copying text to the clipboard, hypertext navigation, table-of-contents bookmarks and editing of forms.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAtril is a simple multi-page document viewer. Atril is vulnerable to a critical Command Injection Vulnerability. This vulnerability gives the attacker immediate access to the target system when the target user opens a crafted document or clicks on a crafted link/URL using a maliciously crafted CBT document which is a TAR archive. A patch is available at commit ce41df6.\n(CVE-2023-51698)\r\n\r\nAtril Document Viewer is the default document reader of the MATE desktop environment for Linux. A path traversal and arbitrary file write vulnerability exists in versions of Atril prior to 1.26.2. This vulnerability is capable of writing arbitrary files anywhere on the filesystem to which the user opening a crafted document has access. The only limitation is that this vulnerability cannot be exploited to overwrite existing files, but that doesn&apos;t stop an attacker from achieving Remote Command Execution on the target system. Version 1.26.2 of Atril contains a patch for this vulnerability.(CVE-2023-52076)",
