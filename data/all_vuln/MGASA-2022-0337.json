An attacker who supplies a crafted file to\ntiffcrop (likely via tricking a user to run tiffcrop on it with certain\nparameters) could cause a crash or in some cases, further exploitation.\n(CVE-2022-2867)\n\nlibtiff's tiffcrop utility has a improper input validation flaw that can\nlead to out of bounds read and ultimately cause a crash if an attacker is\nable to supply a crafted file to tiffcrop. (CVE-2022-2868)\n\nlibtiff's tiffcrop tool has a uint32_t underflow which leads to out of\nbounds read and write in the extractContigSamples8bits routine. An\nattacker who supplies a crafted file to tiffcrop could trigger this flaw,\nmost likely by tricking a user into opening the crafted file with\ntiffcrop. Triggering this flaw could cause a crash or potentially further\nexploitation. (CVE-2022-2869)\n",
