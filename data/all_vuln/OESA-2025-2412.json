This vulnerability is classified as CWE-122 heap-based buffer overflow. A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc(). Impacted are confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The exploit is available at sourceware.org and is declared as proof-of-concept. The code maintainer replied with &quot;[f]ixed for 2.46&quot;. Applying the patch ea1a0737c7692737a644af极速时时彩0486b71e4a392极速时时彩cbca8 is able to eliminate this problem.
