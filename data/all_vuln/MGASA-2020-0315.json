  "details": "Updated mumble package fixes security vulnerability:\n\n\nOCB2 is known to be broken under certain conditions:\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2019/311\n\nTo execute the universal attacks described in the paper, an attacker\nneeds access to an encryption oracle that allows it to perform encryption\nqueries with attacker-chosen nonce. Luckily in Mumble the encryption nonce\nis a fixed counter which is far too restrictive for the universal attacks\nto be feasible against Mumble.\n\nThe basic attacks do not require an attacker-chosen nonce and as such are\nmore applicable to Mumble. They are however of limited use and do require\nan en- and a decryption oracle which Mumble seemingly does not provide at\nthe same time.\n\nTo be on the safe side, this commit implements the counter-cryptanalysis\nmeasure described in the paper in section 9 for the sender and receiver side.\nThis way if either server of client are patched, their communication is almost\ncertainly (merely lacking formal proof) not susceptible to the attacks described\nin the paper.\n\n\nFixed: Potential exploit in the OCB2 encryption (#4227)\n",
