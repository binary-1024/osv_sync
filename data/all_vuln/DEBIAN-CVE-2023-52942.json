As a result, it is possible to leave parent with no effective cpu left even if there are tasks in the parent cpuset. This can lead to system panic as reported in [1].  Fix this probem by updating the check to fail the enabling the partition if parent's effective_cpus is a subset of the child's cpus_allowed.  Also record the error code when an error happens in update_prstate() and add a test case where parent partition and child have the same cpu list and parent has task. Enabling partition in the child will fail in this case.
