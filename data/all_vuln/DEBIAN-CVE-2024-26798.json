But it performs so only for user fonts. It means that the \"system\"/internal fonts are not restored at all. So in result, the very first call to fbcon_do_set_font() performs no restore at all upon failing vc_resize().  This can be reproduced by Syzkaller to crash the system on the next invocation of font_get(). It's rather hard to hit the allocation failure in vc_resize() on the first font_set(), but not impossible. Esp. if fault injection is used to aid the execution/failure. It was demonstrated by Sirius:   BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: fffffffffffffff8   #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode   #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page   PGD cb7b067 P4D cb7b067 PUD cb7d067 PMD 0   Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN   CPU: 1 PID: 8007 Comm: poc Not tainted 6.7.0-g9d1694dc91ce #20   Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.15.0-1 04/01/2014   RIP: 0010:fbcon_get_font+0x229/0x800 drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbcon.c:2286   Call Trace:    <TASK>    con_font_get drivers/tty/vt/vt.c:4558 [inline]    con_font_op+0x1fc/0xf20 drivers/tty/vt/vt.c:4673    vt_k_ioctl drivers/tty/vt/vt_ioctl.c:474 [inline]    vt_ioctl+0x632/0x2ec0 drivers/tty/vt/vt_ioctl.c:752    tty_ioctl+0x6f8/0x1570 drivers/tty/tty_io.c:2803    vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]   ...
