{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-25621","published":"2025-11-06T19:15:40Z","modified":"2025-11-10T05:11:07.931186Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-25621"],"details":"containerd is an open-source container runtime. Versions 0.1.0 through 1.7.28, 2.0.0-beta.0 through 2.0.6, 2.1.0-beta.0 through 2.1.4 and 2.2.0-beta.0 through 2.2.0-rc.1 have an overly broad default permission vulnerability. Directory paths `/var/lib/containerd`, `/run/containerd/io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri` and `/run/containerd/io.containerd.sandbox.controller.v1.shim` were all created with incorrect permissions. This issue is fixed in versions 1.7.29, 2.0.7, 2.1.5 and 2.2.0. Workarounds include updating system administrator permissions so the host can manually chmod the directories to not have group or world accessible permissions, or to run containerd in rootless mode.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"containerd","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/containerd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.4.12~ds1-1~deb11u1","1.4.13~ds1-1~deb11u1","1.4.13~ds1-1~deb11u2","1.4.13~ds1-1~deb11u3","1.4.13~ds1-1~deb11u4","1.4.13~ds1-1~deb11u5","1.4.5~ds1-2","1.4.5~ds1-2+deb11u1","1.5.0~beta0~ds1-1","1.5.0~beta1~ds1-1","1.5.0~beta1~ds1-2","1.5.0~beta2~ds1-1","1.5.0~beta3~ds1-1","1.5.0~beta4~ds1-1","1.5.0~rc0~ds1-1","1.5.0~rc1~ds1-1","1.5.2~ds1-1","1.5.3~ds1-1","1.5.4~ds1-1","1.5.5~ds1-1","1.5.7~ds1-1","1.5.7~ds1-2","1.5.8~ds1-1","1.5.8~ds1-2","1.5.8~ds1-3","1.5.9~ds1-1","1.6.0~ds1-1","1.6.0~ds1-2","1.6.0~ds1-3","1.6.0~ds1-4","1.6.0~ds1-5","1.6.11~ds1-1","1.6.12~ds1-1","1.6.13~ds1-1","1.6.14~ds1-1","1.6.16~ds1-1","1.6.17~ds1-1","1.6.18~ds1-1","1.6.1~ds1-1","1.6.20~ds1-1","1.6.20~ds1-2","1.6.24~ds1-1","1.6.24~ds1-2","1.6.2~ds1-1","1.6.6~ds1-1","1.6.8~ds1-1","1.6.9~ds1-1","1.7.18~ds1-1","1.7.18~ds1-2","1.7.18~ds1-3","1.7.18~ds1-4","1.7.18~ds1-5","1.7.18~ds1-6","1.7.18~ds2-1","1.7.20~ds2-1","1.7.20~ds2-2","1.7.21~ds2-1","1.7.22~ds1-1","1.7.23~ds1-1","1.7.23~ds1-2","1.7.23~ds1-3","1.7.23~ds2-1","1.7.24~ds1-1","1.7.24~ds1-10","1.7.24~ds1-2","1.7.24~ds1-3","1.7.24~ds1-4","1.7.24~ds1-5","1.7.24~ds1-6","1.7.24~ds1-7","1.7.24~ds1-8","1.7.24~ds1-9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-25621.json"}},{"package":{"name":"containerd","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/containerd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.6.20~ds1-1","1.6.20~ds1-1+deb12u1","1.6.20~ds1-2","1.6.24~ds1-1","1.6.24~ds1-2","1.7.18~ds1-1","1.7.18~ds1-2","1.7.18~ds1-3","1.7.18~ds1-4","1.7.18~ds1-5","1.7.18~ds1-6","1.7.18~ds2-1","1.7.20~ds2-1","1.7.20~ds2-2","1.7.21~ds2-1","1.7.22~ds1-1","1.7.23~ds1-1","1.7.23~ds1-2","1.7.23~ds1-3","1.7.23~ds2-1","1.7.24~ds1-1","1.7.24~ds1-10","1.7.24~ds1-2","1.7.24~ds1-3","1.7.24~ds1-4","1.7.24~ds1-5","1.7.24~ds1-6","1.7.24~ds1-7","1.7.24~ds1-8","1.7.24~ds1-9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-25621.json"}},{"package":{"name":"containerd","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/containerd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.7.24~ds1-10","1.7.24~ds1-6","1.7.24~ds1-7","1.7.24~ds1-8","1.7.24~ds1-9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-25621.json"}},{"package":{"name":"containerd","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/containerd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.7.24~ds1-9"}]}],"versions":["1.7.24~ds1-6","1.7.24~ds1-7","1.7.24~ds1-8"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-25621.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-25621"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
