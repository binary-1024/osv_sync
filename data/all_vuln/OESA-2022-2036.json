It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function nilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level of the file fs/nilfs2/inode.c of the component nilfs2. The manipulation leads to null pointer dereference. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211920.(CVE-2022-3621)\r\n\r\nA vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Linux Kernel. Affected by this issue is the function tst_timer of the file drivers/atm/idt77252.c of the component IPsec. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211934 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.(CVE-2022-3635)\r\n\r\ndrivers/usb/mon/mon_bin.c in usbmon in the Linux kernel before 5.19.15 and 6.x before 6.0.1 allows a user-space client to corrupt the monitor&apos;s internal memory.(CVE-2022-43750)\n\nA vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function vsock_connect of the file net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c of the component IPsec. The manipulation leads to memory leak. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211930 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.(CVE-2022-3629)\n\nA vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in Linux Kernel. This issue affects the function nilfs_attach_log_writer of the file fs/nilfs2/segment.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to memory leak. The attack may be initiated remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211961 was assigned to this vulnerability.(CVE-2022-3646)\n\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s networking code. A use-after-free was found in the way the sch_sfb enqueue function used the socket buffer (SKB) cb field after the same SKB had been enqueued (and freed) into a child qdisc. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to crash the system, causing a denial of service.(CVE-2022-3586)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kernel","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/kernel&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.aarch64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.aarch64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["kernel-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.x86_64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.x86_64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2211.1.0.0175.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-2036.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2022-2036"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40768"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3621"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3635"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-43750"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3629"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3646"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3586"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
