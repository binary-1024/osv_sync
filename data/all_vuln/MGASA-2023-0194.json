  "details": "Improper Validation of Array Index vulnerability in the spreadsheet\ncomponent of The Document Foundation LibreOffice allows an attacker to\ncraft a spreadsheet document that will cause an array index underflow when\nloaded. In the affected versions of LibreOffice certain malformed\nspreadsheet formulas, such as AGGREGATE, could be created with less\nparameters passed to the formula interpreter than it expected, leading to\nan array index underflow, in which case there is a risk that arbitrary\ncode could be executed. (CVE-2023-0950)\n\nImproper access control in editor components of The Document Foundation\nLibreOffice allowed an attacker to craft a document that would cause\nexternal links to be loaded without prompt. In the affected versions of\nLibreOffice documents that used \"floating frames\" linked to external\nfiles, would load the contents of those frames without prompting the user\nfor permission to do so. This was inconsistent with the treatment of other\nlinked content in LibreOffice. (CVE-2023-2255)\n",
