This issue enables an untrusted or compromised guest to crash the hypervisor&apos;s vSwitch by forging Virtio descriptors to cause out-of-bounds reads. This flaw allows an attacker with a malicious VM using a virtio driver to cause the vhost-user side to crash by sending a packet with a Tx checksum offload request and an invalid csum_start offset.(CVE-2024-11614)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"dpdk","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/dpdk&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"23.11-26.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["dpdk-23.11-26.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","dpdk-debuginfo-23.11-26.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","dpdk-debugsource-23.11-26.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","dpdk-devel-23.11-26.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","dpdk-tools-23.11-26.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["dpdk-23.11-26.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["dpdk-23.11-26.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","dpdk-debuginfo-23.11-26.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","dpdk-debugsource-23.11-26.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","dpdk-devel-23.11-26.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","dpdk-tools-23.11-26.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1003.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-1003"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-11614"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
