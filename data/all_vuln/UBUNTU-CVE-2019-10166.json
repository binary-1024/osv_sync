If a managed save had already been created by a privileged user, a local attacker could modify this file such that libvirtd would execute an arbitrary program when the domain was resumed.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libvirt","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libvirt@4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12?arch=source&distro=bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12"}]}],"versions":["3.6.0-1ubuntu5","3.6.0-1ubuntu6","4.0.0-1ubuntu1","4.0.0-1ubuntu2","4.0.0-1ubuntu3","4.0.0-1ubuntu4","4.0.0-1ubuntu5","4.0.0-1ubuntu6","4.0.0-1ubuntu7","4.0.0-1ubuntu8","4.0.0-1ubuntu8.1","4.0.0-1ubuntu8.2","4.0.0-1ubuntu8.3","4.0.0-1ubuntu8.4","4.0.0-1ubuntu8.5","4.0.0-1ubuntu8.6","4.0.0-1ubuntu8.7","4.0.0-1ubuntu8.8","4.0.0-1ubuntu8.9","4.0.0-1ubuntu8.10","4.0.0-1ubuntu8.11"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"libnss-libvirt","binary_version":"4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12"},{"binary_name":"libvirt-bin","binary_version":"4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12"},{"binary_name":"libvirt-clients","binary_version":"4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12"},{"binary_name":"libvirt-daemon","binary_version":"4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12"},{"binary_name":"libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-gluster","binary_version":"4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12"},{"binary_name":"libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-rbd","binary_version":"4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12"},{"binary_name":"libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-sheepdog","binary_version":"4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12"},{"binary_name":"libvirt-daemon-driver-storage-zfs","binary_version":"4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12"},{"binary_name":"libvirt-daemon-system","binary_version":"4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12"},{"binary_name":"libvirt-dev","binary_version":"4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12"},{"binary_name":"libvirt-sanlock","binary_version":"4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12"},{"binary_name":"libvirt-wireshark","binary_version":"4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12"},{"binary_name":"libvirt0","binary_version":"4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2019/UBUNTU-CVE-2019-10166.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-10166"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019-1579.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://access.redhat.com/libvirt-privesc-vulnerabilities"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://security.libvirt.org/2019/0005.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4047-1"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10166"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
