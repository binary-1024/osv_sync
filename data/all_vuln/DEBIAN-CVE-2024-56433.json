NOTE: it may also be argued that system administrators should not have assigned uids, within local networks, that are within the range that can occur in /etc/subuid.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"shadow","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/shadow?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:4.11.1+dfsg1-0exp1","1:4.11.1+dfsg1-1","1:4.11.1+dfsg1-2","1:4.12.3+dfsg1-1","1:4.12.3+dfsg1-2","1:4.12.3+dfsg1-3","1:4.13+dfsg1-1","1:4.13+dfsg1-2","1:4.13+dfsg1-3","1:4.13+dfsg1-4","1:4.13+dfsg1-5","1:4.15.1-1","1:4.15.2-1","1:4.15.2-2","1:4.15.2-3","1:4.15.3-1","1:4.15.3-2","1:4.15.3-3","1:4.16.0-1","1:4.16.0-2","1:4.16.0-3","1:4.16.0-4","1:4.16.0-5","1:4.16.0-6","1:4.16.0-7","1:4.17.0-1","1:4.17.0~rc1-1","1:4.17.0~rc1-2","1:4.17.1-1","1:4.17.1-2","1:4.17.2-1","1:4.17.2-2","1:4.17.2-3","1:4.17.2-4","1:4.17.2-5","1:4.17.2-5+hurd.1","1:4.17.2-6","1:4.17.3-1","1:4.17.3-2","1:4.17.3-3","1:4.17.4-1","1:4.17.4-2","1:4.18.0-1","1:4.8.1-1","1:4.8.1-1+deb11u1","1:4.8.1-1.1","1:4.8.1-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-56433.json"}},{"package":{"name":"shadow","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/shadow?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:4.13+dfsg1-1","1:4.13+dfsg1-1+deb12u1","1:4.13+dfsg1-2","1:4.13+dfsg1-3","1:4.13+dfsg1-4","1:4.13+dfsg1-5","1:4.15.1-1","1:4.15.2-1","1:4.15.2-2","1:4.15.2-3","1:4.15.3-1","1:4.15.3-2","1:4.15.3-3","1:4.16.0-1","1:4.16.0-2","1:4.16.0-3","1:4.16.0-4","1:4.16.0-5","1:4.16.0-6","1:4.16.0-7","1:4.17.0-1","1:4.17.0~rc1-1","1:4.17.0~rc1-2","1:4.17.1-1","1:4.17.1-2","1:4.17.2-1","1:4.17.2-2","1:4.17.2-3","1:4.17.2-4","1:4.17.2-5","1:4.17.2-5+hurd.1","1:4.17.2-6","1:4.17.3-1","1:4.17.3-2","1:4.17.3-3","1:4.17.4-1","1:4.17.4-2","1:4.18.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-56433.json"}},{"package":{"name":"shadow","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/shadow?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:4.17.4-2","1:4.18.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-56433.json"}},{"package":{"name":"shadow","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/shadow?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:4.17.4-2","1:4.18.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-56433.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-56433"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
