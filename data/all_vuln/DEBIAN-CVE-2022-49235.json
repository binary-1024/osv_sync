{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49235","published":"2025-02-26T07:01:00Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:17:30.075833Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-49235"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ath9k_htc: fix uninit value bugs  Syzbot reported 2 KMSAN bugs in ath9k. All of them are caused by missing field initialization.  In htc_connect_service() svc_meta_len and pad are not initialized. Based on code it looks like in current skb there is no service data, so simply initialize svc_meta_len to 0.  htc_issue_send() does not initialize htc_frame_hdr::control array. Based on firmware code, it will initialize it by itself, so simply zero whole array to make KMSAN happy  Fail logs:  BUG: KMSAN: kernel-usb-infoleak in usb_submit_urb+0x6c1/0x2aa0 drivers/usb/core/urb.c:430  usb_submit_urb+0x6c1/0x2aa0 drivers/usb/core/urb.c:430  hif_usb_send_regout drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/hif_usb.c:127 [inline]  hif_usb_send+0x5f0/0x16f0 drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/hif_usb.c:479  htc_issue_send drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/htc_hst.c:34 [inline]  htc_connect_service+0x143e/0x1960 drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/htc_hst.c:275 ...
