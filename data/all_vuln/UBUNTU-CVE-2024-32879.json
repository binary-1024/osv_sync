Prior to version 5.4.1, due to default case-insensitive collation in MySQL or MariaDB databases, third-party authentication user IDs are not case-sensitive and could cause different IDs to match. This issue has been addressed by a fix released in version 5.4.1. An immediate workaround would be to change collation of the affected field.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-social-auth","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/python-social-auth@0.2.13-1?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.2.1-2build1","0.2.13-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"python-social-auth","binary_version":"0.2.13-1"},{"binary_name":"python3-social-auth","binary_version":"0.2.13-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2024/UBUNTU-CVE-2024-32879.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-social-auth","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/python-social-auth@1:0.2.21+dfsg-1?arch=source&distro=bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:0.2.21+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"python-social-auth","binary_version":"1:0.2.21+dfsg-1"},{"binary_name":"python3-social-auth","binary_version":"1:0.2.21+dfsg-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2024/UBUNTU-CVE-2024-32879.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-32879"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32879"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/security/advisories/GHSA-2gr8-3wc7-xhj3"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/pull/566"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/commit/31c3e0c7edb187004d8abbde7e9c4f7ef9098138"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
