But at the same time, we did a pte_unmap(vmf->pte).  After a pte_unmap(vmf->pte) unmap and rcu_read_unlock(), the page table may be racily changed and vmf->ptl maybe fails to protect the actual page table.  Fix this by replacing pte_offset_map() with pte_offset_map_nolock().  As David said, the PTL pointer might be stale so if we continue to use it infilemap_fault_recheck_pte_none(), it might trigger UAF.  Also, if the PTL fails, the issue fixed by commit 58f327f2ce80 (\"filemap: avoid unnecessary major faults in filemap_fault()\") might reappear.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.9.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-42233.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.9.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-42233.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-42233"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
