  "details": "There's a vulnerability in the libssh package where when a libssh consumer passes in an unexpectedly large input buffer to ssh_get_fingerprint_hash() function. In such cases the bin_to_base64() function can experience an integer overflow leading to a memory under allocation, when that happens it's possible that the program perform out of bounds write leading to a heap corruption.\nThis issue affects only 32-bits builds of libssh.",
