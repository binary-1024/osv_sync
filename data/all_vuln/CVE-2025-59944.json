Versions 1.6.23 and below contain case-sensitive checks in the way Cursor IDE protects its sensitive files (e.g., */.cursor/mcp.json), which allows attackers to modify the content of these files through prompt injection and achieve remote code execution. A prompt injection can lead to full RCE through modifying sensitive files on case-insensitive fileystems. This issue is fixed in version 1.7.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-59944.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.7"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/cursor/cursor/security/advisories/GHSA-xcwh-rrwj-gxc7"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
