  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: asix: add proper error handling of usb read errors  Syzbot once again hit uninit value in asix driver. The problem still the same -- asix_read_cmd() reads less bytes, than was requested by caller.  Since all read requests are performed via asix_read_cmd() let's catch usb related error there and add __must_check notation to be sure all callers actually check return value.  So, this patch adds sanity check inside asix_read_cmd(), that simply checks if bytes read are not less, than was requested and adds missing error handling of asix_read_cmd() all across the driver code.",
