  "details": "Multiple flaws were discovered in the ImagingLib and the image attribute,\nchannel, layout and raster processing in the 2D component. An untrusted\nJava application or applet could possibly use these flaws to trigger Java\nVirtual Machine memory corruption (CVE-2013-2470, CVE-2013-2471,\nCVE-2013-2472, CVE-2013-2473, CVE-2013-2463, CVE-2013-2465, CVE-2013-2469).\n\nInteger overflow flaws were found in the way AWT processed certain input.\nAn attacker could use these flaws to execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user running an untrusted Java applet or application\n(CVE-2013-2459).\n\nMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Sound and\nJMX components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could\nuse these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions (CVE-2013-2448,\nCVE-2013-2457, CVE-2013-2453).\n\nMultiple flaws in the Serialization, Networking, Libraries and CORBA\ncomponents can be exploited by an untrusted Java application or applet to\ngain access to potentially sensitive information (CVE-2013-2456,\nCVE-2013-2447, CVE-2013-2455, CVE-2013-2452, CVE-2013-2443, CVE-2013-2446).\n\nIt was discovered that the Hotspot component did not properly handle\nout-of-memory errors. An untrusted Java application or applet could\npossibly use these flaws to terminate the Java Virtual Machine\n(CVE-2013-2445).\n\nIt was discovered that the AWT component did not properly manage certain\nresources and that the ObjectStreamClass of the Serialization component\ndid not properly handle circular references. An untrusted Java application\nor applet could possibly use these flaws to cause a denial of service\n(CVE-2013-2444, CVE-2013-2450).\n\nIt was discovered that the Libraries component contained certain errors\nrelated to XML security and the class loader. A remote attacker could\npossibly exploit these flaws to bypass intended security mechanisms or\ndisclose potentially sensitive information and cause a denial of service\n(CVE-2013-2407, CVE-2013-2461).\n\nIt was discovered that JConsole did not properly inform the user when\nestablishing an SSL connection failed. An attacker could exploit this flaw\nto gain access to potentially sensitive information (CVE-2013-2412).\n\nIt was found that documentation generated by Javadoc was vulnerable to a\nframe injection attack. If such documentation was accessible over a\nnetwork, and a remote attacker could trick a user into visiting a\nspecially-crafted URL, it would lead to arbitrary web content being\ndisplayed next to the documentation. This could be used to perform a\nphishing attack by providing frame content that spoofed a login form on\nthe site hosting the vulnerable documentation (CVE-2013-1571).\n\nIt was discovered that the 2D component created shared memory segments with\ninsecure permissions. A local attacker could use this flaw to read or write\nto the shared memory segment (CVE-2013-1500).\n\nIt was discovered that the Networking component did not properly enforce\nexclusive port binding. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to bind to\nports intended to be exclusively bound (CVE-2013-2451).\n\nThis updates IcedTea6 to version 1.11.12, which fixes these issues, as well\nas several other bugs.\n\nAdditionally, this OpenJDK update causes icedtea-web, the Java browser\nplugin, to crash, so icedtea-web has been patched to fix this on Mageia 2.\n",
