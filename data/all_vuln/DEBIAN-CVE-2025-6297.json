{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-6297","published":"2025-07-01T17:15:30Z","modified":"2025-10-14T04:26:59.720246Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-6297"],"details":"It was discovered that dpkg-deb does not properly sanitize directory permissions when extracting a control member into a temporary directory, which is documented as being a safe operation even on untrusted data. This may result in leaving temporary files behind on cleanup. Given automated and repeated execution of dpkg-deb commands on adversarial .deb packages or with well compressible files, placed inside a directory with permissions not allowing removal by a non-root user, this can end up in a DoS scenario due to causing disk quota exhaustion or disk full conditions.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"dpkg","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dpkg?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.20.10","1.20.11","1.20.12","1.20.13","1.20.9","1.21.0","1.21.1","1.21.10","1.21.11","1.21.12","1.21.13","1.21.14","1.21.15","1.21.16","1.21.17","1.21.18","1.21.19","1.21.2","1.21.20","1.21.21","1.21.22","1.21.3","1.21.4","1.21.5","1.21.5+nmu1","1.21.6","1.21.7","1.21.8","1.21.9","1.22.0","1.22.1","1.22.10","1.22.11","1.22.12","1.22.13","1.22.14","1.22.15","1.22.16","1.22.17","1.22.18","1.22.19","1.22.2","1.22.20","1.22.21","1.22.3","1.22.4","1.22.5","1.22.6","1.22.7","1.22.8","1.22.9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-6297.json"}},{"package":{"name":"dpkg","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dpkg?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.21.22","1.22.0","1.22.1","1.22.10","1.22.11","1.22.12","1.22.13","1.22.14","1.22.15","1.22.16","1.22.17","1.22.18","1.22.19","1.22.2","1.22.20","1.22.21","1.22.3","1.22.4","1.22.5","1.22.6","1.22.7","1.22.8","1.22.9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-6297.json"}},{"package":{"name":"dpkg","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dpkg?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.22.21"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-6297.json"}},{"package":{"name":"dpkg","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dpkg?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.22.21"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-6297.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-6297"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N"}]}
