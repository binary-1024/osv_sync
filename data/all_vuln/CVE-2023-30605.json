The Archery project contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases. User input coming from the `variable_name` and `variable_value` parameter value in the `sql/instance.py` `param_edit` endpoint is passed to a set of methods in given SQL engine implementations, which concatenate user input unsafely into a SQL query and afterwards pass it to the `query` method of each database engine for execution. The affected methods are: `set_variable` in `sql/engines/goinception.py` which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/goinception.py`, `get_variables` in `sql/engines/goinception.py`  which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/goinception.py`, `set_variable` in `sql/engines/mysql.py`  which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/mysql.py` `query`, and `get_variables` in `sql/engines/mysql.py`which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/mysql.py` `query`. Each of these issues may be mitigated by escaping user input or by using prepared statements when executing SQL queries.
