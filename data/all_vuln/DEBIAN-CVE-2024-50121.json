If the `nfsd_client_shrinker` is running concurrently, the `expire_client` function will first unhash this client and then destroy it. This can lead to the following warning. Additionally, numerous use-after-free errors may occur as well.  nfsd_client_shrinker         echo 0 > /proc/fs/nfsd/threads  expire_client                nfsd_shutdown_net   unhash_client
