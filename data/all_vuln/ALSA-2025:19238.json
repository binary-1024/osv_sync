It is often referred to as a data-structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. For performance, Redis works with an in-memory data set. You can persist it either by dumping the data set to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.  \n\nSecurity Fix(es):  \n\n  * redis: Lua library commands may lead to integer overflow and potential RCE (CVE-2025-46817)\n  * Redis: Redis: Authenticated users can execute LUA scripts as a different user (CVE-2025-46818)\n  * Redis: Redis is vulnerable to DoS via specially crafted LUA scripts (CVE-2025-46819)\n  * Redis: Redis Lua Use-After-Free may lead to remote code execution (CVE-2025-49844)\n\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"redis","ecosystem":"AlmaLinux:8","purl":"pkg:rpm/almalinux/redis"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.2.20-1.module_el8.10.0+4056+739731b0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/AlmaLinux/osv-database/blob/master/advisories/almalinux8/ALSA-2025:19238.json"}},{"package":{"name":"redis-devel","ecosystem":"AlmaLinux:8","purl":"pkg:rpm/almalinux/redis-devel"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.2.20-1.module_el8.10.0+4056+739731b0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/AlmaLinux/osv-database/blob/master/advisories/almalinux8/ALSA-2025:19238.json"}},{"package":{"name":"redis-doc","ecosystem":"AlmaLinux:8","purl":"pkg:rpm/almalinux/redis-doc"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.2.20-1.module_el8.10.0+4056+739731b0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/AlmaLinux/osv-database/blob/master/advisories/almalinux8/ALSA-2025:19238.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:19238"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-46817"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-46818"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-46819"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-49844"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2401258"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2401292"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2401322"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2401324"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://errata.almalinux.org/8/ALSA-2025-19238.html"}]}
