{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-71080","published":"2026-01-13T16:16:07.550Z","modified":"2026-01-14T11:11:05.647746Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-71080"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ipv6: fix a BUG in rt6_get_pcpu_route() under PREEMPT_RT  On PREEMPT_RT kernels, after rt6_get_pcpu_route() returns NULL, the current task can be preempted. Another task running on the same CPU may then execute rt6_make_pcpu_route() and successfully install a pcpu_rt entry. When the first task resumes execution, its cmpxchg() in rt6_make_pcpu_route() will fail because rt6i_pcpu is no longer NULL, triggering the BUG_ON(prev). It's easy to reproduce it by adding mdelay() after rt6_get_pcpu_route().  Using preempt_disable/enable is not appropriate here because ip6_rt_pcpu_alloc() may sleep.  Fix this by handling the cmpxchg() failure gracefully on PREEMPT_RT: free our allocation and return the existing pcpu_rt installed by another task. The BUG_ON is replaced by WARN_ON_ONCE for non-PREEMPT_RT kernels where such races should not occur.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.57-1","6.12.57-1~bpo12+1","6.12.63-1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.10-1","6.16.11-1","6.16.12-1","6.16.12-1~bpo13+1","6.16.12-2","6.16.3-1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16.5-1","6.16.6-1","6.16.7-1","6.16.8-1","6.16.9-1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1","6.17.10-1","6.17.11-1","6.17.12-1","6.17.13-1","6.17.13-1~bpo13+1","6.17.2-1~exp1","6.17.5-1~exp1","6.17.6-1","6.17.7-1","6.17.7-2","6.17.8-1","6.17.8-1~bpo13+1","6.17.9-1","6.18.1-1~exp1","6.18.2-1~exp1","6.18.3-1","6.18~rc4-1~exp1","6.18~rc4-1~exp2","6.18~rc5-1~exp1","6.18~rc6-1~exp1","6.18~rc7-1~exp1","6.19~rc4-1~exp1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-71080.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.57-1","6.12.57-1~bpo12+1","6.12.63-1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.10-1","6.16.11-1","6.16.12-1","6.16.12-1~bpo13+1","6.16.12-2","6.16.3-1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16.5-1","6.16.6-1","6.16.7-1","6.16.8-1","6.16.9-1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1","6.17.10-1","6.17.11-1","6.17.12-1","6.17.13-1","6.17.13-1~bpo13+1","6.17.2-1~exp1","6.17.5-1~exp1","6.17.6-1","6.17.7-1","6.17.7-2","6.17.8-1","6.17.8-1~bpo13+1","6.17.9-1","6.18.1-1~exp1","6.18.2-1~exp1","6.18.3-1","6.18~rc4-1~exp1","6.18~rc4-1~exp2","6.18~rc5-1~exp1","6.18~rc6-1~exp1","6.18~rc7-1~exp1","6.19~rc4-1~exp1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-71080.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-71080"}]}
