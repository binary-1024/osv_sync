  "details": "Jiaqi Peng discovered that the poppler pdfunite tool incorrectly parsed\ncertain malformed PDF documents. If a user or automated system were tricked\ninto opening a crafted PDF file, an attacker could cause poppler to crash,\nresulting in a denial of service (CVE-2017-7511).\n\nIt was discovered that the poppler pdfunite tool incorrectly parsed certain\nmalformed PDF documents. If a user or automated system were tricked into\nopening a crafted PDF file, an attacker could cause poppler to hang,\nresulting in a denial of service (CVE-2017-7515).\n\nIt was discovered that poppler incorrectly handled memory when processing\nPDF documents. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a\ncrafted PDF file, an attacker could cause poppler to consume resources,\nresulting in a denial of service (CVE-2017-9406, CVE-2017-9408).\n\nAlberto Garcia, Francisco Oca, and Suleman Ali discovered that the poppler\npdftocairo tool incorrectly parsed certain malformed PDF documents. If a\nuser or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted PDF file, an\nattacker could cause poppler to crash, resulting in a denial of service\n(CVE-2017-9775).\n\nInteger overflow leading to Heap buffer overflow in JBIG2Stream.cc in\npdftocairo in Poppler allows attackers to cause a denial of service\n(application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted\nPDF document (CVE-2017-9776).\n\nThe function GfxImageColorMap::getGray in GfxState.cc in Poppler allows\nattackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer over-read and\napplication crash) via a crafted PDF document, related to missing color-map\nvalidation in ImageOutputDev.cc (CVE-2017-9865).\n",
