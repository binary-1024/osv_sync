  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFSv4: Fix a deadlock when recovering state on a sillyrenamed file  If the file is sillyrenamed, and slated for delete on close, it is possible for a server reboot to triggeer an open reclaim, with can again race with the application call to close(). When that happens, the call to put_nfs_open_context() can trigger a synchronous delegreturn call which deadlocks because it is not marked as privileged.  Instead, ensure that the call to nfs4_inode_return_delegation_on_close() catches the delegreturn, and schedules it asynchronously.",
