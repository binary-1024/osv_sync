{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2024-3651","published":"2024-07-07T18:15:09.827Z","modified":"2025-11-19T06:22:07.773799Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-3651"],"details":"A vulnerability was identified in the kjd/idna library, specifically within the `idna.encode()` function, affecting version 3.6. The issue arises from the function's handling of crafted input strings, which can lead to quadratic complexity and consequently, a denial of service condition. This vulnerability is triggered by a crafted input that causes the `idna.encode()` function to process the input with considerable computational load, significantly increasing the processing time in a quadratic manner relative to the input size.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"py3-idna","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-idna?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0-r0","2.1-r0","2.1-r1","2.10-r0","2.2-r0","2.2-r1","2.3-r0","2.4-r0","2.5-r0","2.6-r0","2.7-r0","2.8-r0","2.8-r1","2.8-r2","2.8-r3","2.9-r0","3.0-r0","3.1-r0","3.1-r1","3.2-r0","3.3-r0","3.3-r1","3.3-r2","3.4-r0","3.4-r1","3.4-r2","3.4-r3","3.4-r4","3.6-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-3651.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-idna","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-idna?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0-r0","2.1-r0","2.1-r1","2.10-r0","2.2-r0","2.2-r1","2.3-r0","2.4-r0","2.5-r0","2.6-r0","2.7-r0","2.8-r0","2.8-r1","2.8-r2","2.8-r3","2.9-r0","3.0-r0","3.1-r0","3.1-r1","3.2-r0","3.3-r0","3.3-r1","3.3-r2","3.4-r0","3.4-r1","3.4-r2","3.4-r3","3.4-r4","3.6-r0","3.6-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-3651.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-idna","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-idna?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0-r0","2.1-r0","2.1-r1","2.10-r0","2.2-r0","2.2-r1","2.3-r0","2.4-r0","2.5-r0","2.6-r0","2.7-r0","2.8-r0","2.8-r1","2.8-r2","2.8-r3","2.9-r0","3.0-r0","3.1-r0","3.1-r1","3.2-r0","3.3-r0","3.3-r1","3.3-r2","3.4-r0","3.4-r1","3.4-r2","3.4-r3","3.4-r4","3.6-r0","3.6-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-3651.json"}},{"package":{"name":"py3-idna","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-idna?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0-r0","2.1-r0","2.1-r1","2.10-r0","2.2-r0","2.2-r1","2.3-r0","2.4-r0","2.5-r0","2.6-r0","2.7-r0","2.8-r0","2.8-r1","2.8-r2","2.8-r3","2.9-r0","3.0-r0","3.1-r0","3.1-r1","3.2-r0","3.3-r0","3.3-r1","3.3-r2","3.4-r0","3.4-r1","3.4-r2","3.4-r3","3.4-r4","3.6-r0","3.6-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-3651.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2024-3651"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
