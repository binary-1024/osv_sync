In versions below 6.2.18, because the function to limit the rate of OTP does not exist, an attacker with valid credentials or a malicious user who commits internal fraud can break through the two-factor authentication and hijack the account. This is because the otpLogin mutation does not implement One Time Password rate limiting. As of time of publication, it is unknown whether a patch is available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opencti-platform/opencti","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"337f2722357fb8e8d83967fd36aaf5e0718599da"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-45404.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/security/advisories/GHSA-hg56-r6hh-56j7"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-287"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
