In versions 4.3.6 through 5.3.3, a RangeError vulnerability exists in the numeric entity processing of fast-xml-parser when parsing XML with out-of-range entity code points (e.g., `&#9999999;` or `&#xFFFFFF;`). This causes the parser to throw an uncaught exception, crashing any application that processes untrusted XML input. Version 5.3.4 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/naturalintelligence/fast-xml-parser","events":[{"introduced":"3ab1b3b7a51e56a2fbf4fdf209b855d5449f2445"},{"fixed":"753e770f69d0f30c95b0287f7b8c57e4a93bbc12"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"4.3.6"},{"fixed":"5.3.4"}]}}],"versions":["v4.3.6","v4.4.0","v4.4.1","v4.5.0","v4.5.1","v4.5.2","v5.0.0","v5.0.2","v5.0.4","v5.0.6","v5.0.7","v5.0.9","v5.1.0","v5.2.0","v5.2.1","v5.2.2","v5.2.3","v5.2.5","v5.3.0","v5.3.1","v5.3.2","v5.3.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-25128.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/25xxx/CVE-2026-25128.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser/commit/4e387f61c4a5cef792f6a2f42467013290bf95dc"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser/releases/tag/v5.3.4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser/security/advisories/GHSA-37qj-frw5-hhjh"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-25128"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-20","CWE-248"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/25xxx/CVE-2026-25128.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
