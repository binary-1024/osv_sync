  "details": "SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. SQLite is the most used database engine in the world. SQLite is built into all mobile phones and most computers and comes bundled inside countless other applications that people use every day. It also include lemon and sqlite3_analyzer and tcl tools.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in SQLite s SELECT query functionality (src/select.c). This flaw allows an attacker who is capable of running SQL queries locally on the SQLite database to cause a denial of service or possible code execution by triggering a use-after-free. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-20227)",
