{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-35961","published":"2024-05-20T10:15:11Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:18:24.646466Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-35961"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5: Register devlink first under devlink lock  In case device is having a non fatal FW error during probe, the driver will report the error to user via devlink. This will trigger a WARN_ON, since mlx5 is calling devlink_register() last. In order to avoid the WARN_ON[1], change mlx5 to invoke devl_register() first under devlink lock.
