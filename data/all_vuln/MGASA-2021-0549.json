  "details": "Buffer overflow vulnerability in function stbi__extend_receive in\nstb_image.h in stb 2.26 via a crafted JPEG file. (CVE-2021-28021)\n\nAn issue was discovered in stb stb_image.h 1.33 through 2.27. The HDR\nloader parsed truncated end-of-file RLE scanlines as an infinite sequence\nof zero-length runs. An attacker could potentially have caused denial of\nservice in applications using stb_image by submitting crafted HDR files.\n(CVE-2021-42715)\n\nAn issue was discovered in stb stb_image.h 2.27. The PNM loader\nincorrectly interpreted 16-bit PGM files as 8-bit when converting to RGBA,\nleading to a buffer overflow when later reinterpreting the result as a\n16-bit buffer. An attacker could potentially have crashed a service using\nstb_image, or read up to 1024 bytes of non-consecutive heap data without\ncontrol over the read location. (CVE-2021-42716)\n",
