entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f  The problem is in this flow: 1) Port is enabled, queue_id != 0, in qom_list 2) Port gets disabled         -> team_port_disable()         -> team_queue_override_port_del()         -> del (removed from list) 3) Port is disabled, queue_id != 0, not in any list 4) Priority changes         -> team_queue_override_port_prio_changed()         -> checks: port disabled && queue_id != 0         -> calls del - hits the BUG as it is removed already  To fix this, change the check in team_queue_override_port_prio_changed() so it returns early if port is not enabled.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.10.103-1","5.10.103-1~bpo10+1","5.10.106-1","5.10.113-1","5.10.120-1","5.10.120-1~bpo10+1","5.10.127-1","5.10.127-2","5.10.127-2~bpo10+1","5.10.136-1","5.10.140-1","5.10.148-1","5.10.149-1","5.10.149-2","5.10.158-1","5.10.158-2","5.10.162-1","5.10.178-1","5.10.178-2","5.10.178-3","5.10.179-1","5.10.179-2","5.10.179-3","5.10.179-4","5.10.179-5","5.10.191-1","5.10.197-1","5.10.205-1","5.10.205-2","5.10.209-1","5.10.209-2","5.10.216-1","5.10.218-1","5.10.221-1","5.10.223-1","5.10.226-1","5.10.234-1","5.10.237-1","5.10.244-1","5.10.247-1","5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1","5.10.92-2","5.13.12-1~exp1","5.13.9-1~exp1","5.13.9-1~exp2","5.14-1~exp1","5.14-1~exp2","5.14.1-1~exp1","5.14.12-1","5.14.16-1","5.14.2-1~exp1","5.14.3-1~exp1","5.14.6-1","5.14.6-2","5.14.6-3","5.14.9-1","5.14.9-2","5.14.9-2~bpo11+1","5.15-1~exp1","5.15.1-1~exp1","5.15.15-1","5.15.15-2","5.15.15-2~bpo11+1","5.15.2-1~exp1","5.15.3-1","5.15.5-1","5.15.5-2","5.15.5-2~bpo11+1","5.16.10-1","5.16.11-1","5.16.11-1~bpo11+1","5.16.12-1","5.16.12-1~bpo11+1","5.16.14-1","5.16.18-1","5.16.3-1~exp1","5.16.4-1~exp1","5.16.7-1","5.16.7-2","5.16~rc1-1~exp1","5.16~rc3-1~exp1","5.16~rc4-1~exp1","5.16~rc5-1~exp1","5.16~rc6-1~exp1","5.16~rc7-1~exp1","5.16~rc8-1~exp1","5.17.1-1~exp1","5.17.11-1","5.17.3-1","5.17.6-1","5.17~rc3-1~exp1","5.17~rc4-1~exp1","5.17~rc5-1~exp1","5.17~rc6-1~exp1","5.17~rc7-1~exp1","5.17~rc8-1~exp1","5.18-1~exp1","5.18.14-1","5.18.14-1~bpo11+1","5.18.16-1","5.18.16-1~bpo11+1","5.18.2-1","5.18.2-1~bpo11+1","5.18.5-1","5.19-1~exp1","5.19.11-1","5.19.11-1~bpo11+1","5.19.6-1","5.19~rc4-1~exp1","5.19~rc6-1~exp1","6.0-1~exp1","6.0.10-1","6.0.10-2","6.0.12-1","6.0.12-1+alpha","6.0.12-1~bpo11+1","6.0.2-1","6.0.3-1","6.0.3-1~bpo11+1","6.0.5-1","6.0.6-1","6.0.6-2","6.0.7-1","6.0.8-1","6.0~rc7-1~exp1","6.1.1-1~exp1","6.1.1-1~exp2","6.1.106-1","6.1.106-2","6.1.106-3","6.1.11-1","6.1.112-1","6.1.115-1","6.1.119-1","6.1.12-1","6.1.12-1~bpo11+1","6.1.123-1","6.1.124-1","6.1.128-1","6.1.129-1","6.1.133-1","6.1.135-1","6.1.137-1","6.1.139-1","6.1.140-1","6.1.147-1","6.1.148-1","6.1.15-1","6.1.15-1~bpo11+1","6.1.153-1","6.1.158-1","6.1.159-1","6.1.2-1~exp1","6.1.20-1","6.1.20-1~bpo11+1","6.1.20-2","6.1.20-2~bpo11+1","6.1.25-1","6.1.27-1","6.1.27-1~bpo11+1","6.1.37-1","6.1.38-1","6.1.38-2","6.1.38-2~bpo11+1","6.1.38-3","6.1.38-4","6.1.38-4~bpo11+1","6.1.4-1","6.1.52-1","6.1.55-1","6.1.55-1~bpo11+1","6.1.64-1","6.1.66-1","6.1.67-1","6.1.69-1","6.1.69-1~bpo11+1","6.1.7-1","6.1.76-1","6.1.76-1~bpo11+1","6.1.8-1","6.1.8-1+sh4","6.1.82-1","6.1.85-1","6.1.90-1","6.1.90-1~bpo11+1","6.1.94-1","6.1.94-1~bpo11+1","6.1.98-1","6.1.99-1","6.10-1~exp1","6.10.1-1~exp1","6.10.11-1","6.10.11-1~bpo12+1","6.10.12-1","6.10.3-1","6.10.4-1","6.10.6-1","6.10.6-1~bpo12+1","6.10.7-1","6.10.9-1","6.11-1~exp1","6.11.10-1","6.11.10-1~bpo12+1","6.11.2-1","6.11.4-1","6.11.5-1","6.11.5-1~bpo12+1","6.11.6-1","6.11.7-1","6.11.9-1","6.11~rc4-1~exp1","6.11~rc5-1~exp1","6.12.10-1","6.12.11-1","6.12.11-1+alpha","6.12.11-1+alpha.1","6.12.12-1","6.12.12-1~bpo12+1","6.12.13-1","6.12.15-1","6.12.16-1","6.12.17-1","6.12.19-1","6.12.20-1","6.12.21-1","6.12.22-1","6.12.22-1~bpo12+1","6.12.25-1","6.12.27-1","6.12.27-1~bpo12+1","6.12.29-1","6.12.3-1","6.12.30-1","6.12.30-1~bpo12+1","6.12.31-1","6.12.32-1","6.12.32-1~bpo12+1","6.12.33-1","6.12.33-1~bpo12+1","6.12.35-1","6.12.35-1~bpo12+1","6.12.37-1","6.12.38-1","6.12.38-1~bpo12+1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.5-1","6.12.57-1","6.12.57-1~bpo12+1","6.12.6-1","6.12.63-1","6.12.8-1","6.12.9-1","6.12.9-1+alpha","6.12.9-1~bpo12+1","6.12~rc6-1~exp1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.10-1","6.16.11-1","6.16.12-1","6.16.12-1~bpo13+1","6.16.12-2","6.16.3-1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16.5-1","6.16.6-1","6.16.7-1","6.16.8-1","6.16.9-1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1","6.17.10-1","6.17.11-1","6.17.12-1","6.17.13-1","6.17.13-1~bpo13+1","6.17.2-1~exp1","6.17.5-1~exp1","6.17.6-1","6.17.7-1","6.17.7-2","6.17.8-1","6.17.8-1~bpo13+1","6.17.9-1","6.18.1-1~exp1","6.18.2-1~exp1","6.18.3-1","6.18~rc4-1~exp1","6.18~rc4-1~exp2","6.18~rc5-1~exp1","6.18~rc6-1~exp1","6.18~rc7-1~exp1","6.19~rc4-1~exp1","6.1~rc3-1~exp1","6.1~rc5-1~exp1","6.1~rc6-1~exp1","6.1~rc7-1~exp1","6.1~rc8-1~exp1","6.3.1-1~exp1","6.3.11-1","6.3.2-1~exp1","6.3.4-1~exp1","6.3.5-1~exp1","6.3.7-1","6.3.7-1~bpo12+1","6.4.1-1~exp1","6.4.11-1","6.4.13-1","6.4.4-1","6.4.4-1~bpo12+
