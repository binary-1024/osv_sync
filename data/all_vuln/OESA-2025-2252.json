  "details": "Assimp is a library to load and process geometric scenes from various data formats. Assimp aims to provide a full asset conversion pipeline for use in game engines and real-time rendering systems of any kind, but is not limited to this purpose.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability has been found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3 and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function Assimp::CSMImporter::InternReadFile of the file code/AssetLib/CSM/CSMLoader.cpp of the component CSM File Handler. The manipulation of the argument na leads to out-of-bounds read. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.(CVE-2025-2751)\n\nA vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. Affected by this issue is the function Assimp::LWO::AnimResolver::UpdateAnimRangeSetup of the file code/AssetLib/LWO/LWOAnimation.cpp of the component LWO File Handler. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.(CVE-2025-3158)\n\nA vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. Affected is the function Assimp::MD2Importer::InternReadFile in the library code/AssetLib/MD2/MD2Loader.cpp of the component Malformed File Handler. The manipulation of the argument Name leads to stack-based buffer overflow. The attack needs to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.(CVE-2025-3196)",
