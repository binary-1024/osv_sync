  "details": "Elfutils is a collection of utilities, including stack (to show\nbacktraces), nm (for listing symbols from object files), size\n(for listing the section sizes of an object or archive file),\nstrip (for discarding symbols), readelf (to see the raw ELF file\nstructures), elflint (to check for well-formed ELF files) and\nelfcompress (to compress or decompress ELF sections).\nAlso included are helper libraries which implement DWARF, ELF,\nand machine-specific ELF handling and process introspection.\nIt also provides a DSO which allows reading and\nwriting ELF files on a high level. Third party programs depend on\nthis package to read internals of ELF files. \nYama sysctl setting to enable default attach scope settings\nenabling programs to use ptrace attach, access to\n/proc/PID/{mem,personality,stack,syscall}, and the syscalls\nprocess_vm_readv and process_vm_writev which are used for\ninterprocess services, communication and introspection\n(like synchronisation, signaling, debugging, tracing and\nprofiling) of processes.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability has been found in GNU elfutils 0.192 and classified as critical. This vulnerability affects the function __libdw_thread_tail in the library libdw_alloc.c of the component eu-readelf. The manipulation of the argument w leads to memory corruption. The attack can be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The name of the patch is 2636426a091bd6c6f7f02e49ab20d4cdc6bfc753. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.(CVE-2025-1352)\n\nA vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in GNU elfutils 0.192. This affects the function process_symtab of the file readelf.c of the component eu-readelf. The manipulation of the argument D/a leads to buffer overflow. Local access is required to approach this attack. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier of the patch is 5e5c0394d82c53e97750fe7b18023e6f84157b81. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.(CVE-2025-1365)\n\nA vulnerability has been found in GNU elfutils 0.192 and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function handle_dynamic_symtab of the file readelf.c of the component eu-read. The manipulation leads to null pointer dereference. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The patch is identified as b38e562a4c907e08171c76b8b2def8464d5a104a. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.(CVE-2025-1371)\n\nA vulnerability was found in GNU elfutils 0.192. It has been declared as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function dump_data_section/print_string_section of the file readelf.c of the component eu-readelf. The manipulation of the argument z/x leads to buffer overflow. An attack has to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier of the patch is 73db9d2021cab9e23fd734b0a76a612d52a6f1db. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.(CVE-2025-1372)\n\nA vulnerability classified as problematic was found in GNU elfutils 0.192. This vulnerability affects the function elf_strptr in the library /libelf/elf_strptr.c of the component eu-strip. The manipulation leads to denial of service. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The name of the patch is b16f441cca0a4841050e3215a9f120a6d8aea918.
