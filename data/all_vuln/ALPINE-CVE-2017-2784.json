A specially crafted x509 certificate, when parsed by mbed TLS library, can cause an invalid free of a stack pointer leading to a potential remote code execution. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can act as either a client or a server on a network to deliver malicious x509 certificates to vulnerable applications.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-2784.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-2784.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-2784.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-2784.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-2784.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-2784.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-2784.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-2784.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-2784.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-2784.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-2784.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-2784.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introd
