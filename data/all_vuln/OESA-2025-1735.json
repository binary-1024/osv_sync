  "details": "Sudo is a program designed to allow a sysadmin to give limited root privileges to users and log root activity.  The basic philosophy is to give as few privileges as possible but still allow people to get their work done.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nSudo before 1.9.17p1, when used with a sudoers file that specifies a host that is neither the current host nor ALL, allows listed users to execute commands on unintended machines.(CVE-2025-32462)\n\nA vulnerability has been found in Todd Miller sudo 1.9.14/1.9.15/1.9.16/1.9.17 (Operating System Utility Software) and classified as critical.The manipulation of the argument -R/--chroot with an unknown input leads to a unknown weakness. The CWE definition for the vulnerability is CWE-284. The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.As an impact it is known to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.Applying the patch 1.9.17p1 is able to eliminate this problem.(CVE-2025-32463)",
