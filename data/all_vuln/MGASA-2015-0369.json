  "details": "Updated qemu packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nQemu emulator built with the RTL8139 emulation support is vulnerable to an\ninformation leakage flaw. It could occur while processing network packets\nunder RTL8139 controller's C+ mode of operation. A guest user could use this\nflaw to read uninitialised Qemu heap memory up to 65K bytes (CVE-2015-5165).\n\nQinghao Tang and Mr. Zuozhi discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled memory in\nthe VNC display driver. A malicious guest could use this issue to cause a\ndenial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host as the user\nrunning the QEMU process (CVE-2015-5225). - Mageia 5 only\n\nQemu emulator built with the e1000 NIC emulation support is vulnerable to an\ninfinite loop issue. It could occur while processing transmit descriptor data\nwhen sending a network packet. A privileged user inside guest could use this\nflaw to crash the Qemu instance resulting in DoS (CVE-2015-6815).\n\nQemu emulator built with the IDE disk and CD/DVD-ROM emulation support is\nvulnerable to a divide by zero issue. It could occur while executing an IDE\ncommand WIN_READ_NATIVE_MAX to determine the maximum size of a drive. A\nprivileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu instance\nresulting in DoS (CVE-2015-6855).\n",
