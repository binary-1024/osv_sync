{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-38366","published":"2024-07-01T20:42:38Z","modified":"2025-10-21T02:36:36Z","aliases":["GHSA-x2x4-g675-qg7c"],"summary":"CoacoaPods trunk RCE in email verification system rfc-822","details":"trunk.cocoapods.org is the authentication server for the CoacoaPods dependency manager. The part of trunk which verifies whether a user has a real email address on signup used a rfc-822 library which executes a shell command to validate the email domain MX records validity. It works via an DNS MX. This lookup could be manipulated to also execute a command on the trunk server, effectively giving root access to the server and the infrastructure. This issue was patched server-side with commit 001cc3a430e75a16307f5fd6cdff1363ad2f40f3 in September 2023. This RCE triggered a full user-session reset, as an attacker could have used this method to write to any Podspec in trunk.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-38366.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"001cc3a430e75a16307f5fd6cdff1363ad2f40f3"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/security/advisories/GHSA-x2x4-g675-qg7c"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Trunk-RCEs-2023"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://evasec.webflow.io/blog/eva-discovered-supply-chain-vulnerabities-in-cocoapods#2-remote-code-execution-on-the-cocoapods-trunk-server"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
