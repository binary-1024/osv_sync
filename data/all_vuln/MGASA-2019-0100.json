  "details": "Spice, versions 0.5.2 through 0.14.1, are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds\nread due to an off-by-one error in memslot_get_virt. This may lead to a\ndenial of service, or, in the worst case, code-execution by unauthenticated\nattackers. (CVE-2019-3813)\n\nA vulnerability was discovered in SPICE before version 0.14.1 where the\ngenerated code used for demarshalling messages lacked sufficient bounds\nchecks. A malicious client or server, after authentication, could send\nspecially crafted messages to its peer which would result in a crash or,\npotentially, other impacts. (CVE-2018-10873)\n\nMultiple integer overflow and buffer overflow issues were discovered in\nspice-client's handling of LZ compressed frames. A malicious server could\ncause the client to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2018-10893)\n",
