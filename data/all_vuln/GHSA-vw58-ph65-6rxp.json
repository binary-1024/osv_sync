  "details": "### Summary\nAccess token from query string is not redacted and is potentially exposed in system logs which may be persisted.\n\n### Details\nThe access token in `req.query` is not redacted when the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. If these logs are not properly sanitized or protected, an attacker with access to it can potentially gain administrative control, leading to unauthorized data access and manipulation.\n\n### PoC\n1. Set `LOG_LEVEL=\"raw\"` in the environment.\n2. Send a request with the `access_token` in the query string.\n3. Notice that the `access_token` in `req.query` is not redacted.\n\n### Impact\nIt impacts systems where the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. The `access_token` in the query could potentially be a long-lived static token. Users with impacted systems should rotate their static tokens if they were provided using query string.",
