  "details": "HTTPie (pronounced _aitch-tee-tee-pie_) is a command-line HTTP client. Its goal is to make CLI interaction with web services as human-friendly as possible. HTTPie is designed for testing, debugging, and generally interacting with APIs &amp;amp; HTTP servers. The `http` &amp;amp; `https` commands allow for creating and sending arbitrary HTTP requests. They use simple and natural syntax and provide formatted and colorized output.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nMissing SSL certificate validation in HTTPie v3.2.2 allows attackers to eavesdrop on communications between the host and server via a man-in-the-middle attack.(CVE-2023-48052)",
