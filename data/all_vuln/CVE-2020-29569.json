The Linux kernel PV block backend expects the kernel thread handler to reset ring->xenblkd to NULL when stopped. However, the handler may not have time to run if the frontend quickly toggles between the states connect and disconnect. As a consequence, the block backend may re-use a pointer after it was freed. A misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuously connecting / disconnecting a block frontend. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out. This only affects systems with a Linux blkback.","references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/02/msg00018.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/03/msg00010.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-30"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210205-0001/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4843"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-350.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
