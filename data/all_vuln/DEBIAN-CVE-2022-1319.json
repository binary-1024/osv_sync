For an AJP 400 response, EAP 7 is improperly sending two response packets, and those packets have the reuse flag set even though JBoss EAP closes the connection. A failure occurs when the connection is reused after a 400 by CPING since it reads in the second SEND_HEADERS response packet instead of a CPONG.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"undertow","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/undertow?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.2.17-1"}]}],"versions":["1.3.11-1","1.3.16-1","1.3.19-1","1.3.21-1","1.3.23-1","1.3.4-1","1.3.5-1","1.3.7-1","1.4.0-1","1.4.1-1","1.4.18-1","1.4.20-1","1.4.21-1","1.4.21-2","1.4.22-1","1.4.23-1","1.4.23-2","1.4.23-3","1.4.25-1","1.4.25-2","1.4.3-1","1.4.4-1","1.4.6-1","1.4.7-1","1.4.8-1","2.0.23-1","2.0.25-1","2.0.26-1","2.0.27-1","2.0.28-1","2.0.29-1","2.0.30-1","2.1.0-1","2.1.1-1","2.1.3-1","2.2.0-1","2.2.10-1","2.2.12-1","2.2.13-1","2.2.14-1","2.2.16-1","2.2.2-1","2.2.3-1","2.2.4-1","2.2.5-1","2.2.8-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-1319.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1319"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
