  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fgraph: Add READ_ONCE() when accessing fgraph_array[]  In __ftrace_return_to_handler(), a loop iterates over the fgraph_array[] elements, which are fgraph_ops. The loop checks if an element is a fgraph_stub to prevent using a fgraph_stub afterward.  However, if the compiler reloads fgraph_array[] after this check, it might race with an update to fgraph_array[] that introduces a fgraph_stub. This could result in the stub being processed, but the stub contains a null \"func_hash\" field, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.  To ensure that the gops compared against the fgraph_stub matches the gops processed later, add a READ_ONCE(). A similar patch appears in commit 63a8dfb (\"function_graph: Add READ_ONCE() when accessing fgraph_array[]\").",
