The loop checks if an element is a fgraph_stub to prevent using a fgraph_stub afterward.  However, if the compiler reloads fgraph_array[] after this check, it might race with an update to fgraph_array[] that introduces a fgraph_stub. This could result in the stub being processed, but the stub contains a null \"func_hash\" field, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.  To ensure that the gops compared against the fgraph_stub matches the gops processed later, add a READ_ONCE(). A similar patch appears in commit 63a8dfb (\"function_graph: Add READ_ONCE() when accessing fgraph_array[]\").","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.9-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-57934.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.9-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-57934.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-57934"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
