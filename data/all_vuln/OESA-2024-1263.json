It may look like `stbi__load_gif_main` doesn’t give guarantees about the content of output value `*delays` upon failure. Although it sets `*delays` to zero at the beginning, it doesn’t do it in case the image is not recognized as GIF and a call to `stbi__load_gif_main_outofmem` only frees possibly allocated memory in `*delays` without resetting it to zero. Thus it would be fair to say the caller of `stbi__load_gif_main` is responsible to free the allocated memory in `*delays` only if `stbi__load_gif_main` returns a non null value. However at the same time the function may return null value, but fail to free the memory in `*delays` if internally `stbi__convert_format` is called and fails. Thus the issue may lead to a memory leak if the caller chooses to free `delays` only when `stbi__load_gif_main` didn’t fail or to a double-free if the `delays` is always freed(CVE-2023-45666)\r\n\r\nstb_image is a single file MIT licensed library for processing images.\r\n\r\nIf `stbi__load_gif_main` in `stbi_load_gif_from_memory` fails it returns a null pointer and may keep the `z` variable uninitialized. In case the caller also sets the flip vertically flag, it continues and calls `stbi__vertical_flip_slices` with the null pointer result value and the uninitialized `z` value. This may result in a program crash.(CVE-2023-45667)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"stb","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/stb&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["stb_perlin-devel-0.5.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","stb_c_lexer-devel-0.12.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","stb_herringbone_wang_tile-devel-0.7.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","stb_ds-devel-0.67.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","stb_vorbis-devel-1.22.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","stb_easy_font-devel-1.1.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","stb_tilemap_editor-devel-0.42.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","stb_image-devel-2.27.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","stb-devel-0.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","stb_rect_pack-devel-1.1.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","stb_truetype-devel-1.26.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","stb_divide-devel-0.94.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","stb_leakcheck-devel-0.6.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","stb_hexwave-devel-0.5.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","stb_dxt-devel-1.12.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","stb_connected_components-devel-0.96.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","stb_sprintf-devel-1.10.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","stb_voxel_render-devel-0.89.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","stb_textedit-devel-1.14.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","stb_image_write-devel-1.16.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","stb_image_resize-devel-0.97.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["stb-help-0.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.noarch.rpm"],"src":["stb-0.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["stb_ds-devel-0.67.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","stb_perlin-devel-0.5.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","stb_voxel_render-devel-0.89.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","stb_easy_font-devel-1.1.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","stb_textedit-devel-1.14.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","stb_image_write-devel-1.16.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","stb_image-devel-2.27.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","stb_herringbone_wang_tile-devel-0.7.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","stb_truetype-devel-1.26.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","stb_rect_pack-devel-1.1.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","stb-devel-0.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","stb_connected_components-devel-0.96.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","stb_leakcheck-devel-0.6.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","stb_divide-devel-0.94.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","stb_hexwave-devel-0.5.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","stb_vorbis-devel-1.22.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","stb_c_lexer-devel-0.12.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","stb_sprintf-devel-1.10.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","stb_dxt-devel-1.12.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","stb_image_resize-devel-0.97.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","stb_tilemap_editor-devel-0.42.20220908git8b5f1f3-0.12.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-1263.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2024-1263"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45666"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45667"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Critical"}}
