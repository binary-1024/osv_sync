{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2019-14889","published":"2019-12-10T23:15:10.580Z","modified":"2025-11-19T06:15:11.788548Z","upstream":["CVE-2019-14889"],"details":"A flaw was found with the libssh API function ssh_scp_new() in versions before 0.9.3 and before 0.8.8. When the libssh SCP client connects to a server, the scp command, which includes a user-provided path, is executed on the server-side. In case the library is used in a way where users can influence the third parameter of the function, it would become possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary commands, leading to a compromise of the remote target.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libssh?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.8.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["0.4.5-r0","0.4.6-r0","0.4.8-r0","0.5.0-r0","0.5.1-r0","0.5.2-r0","0.5.2-r1","0.5.3-r0","0.5.4-r0","0.5.5-r0","0.6.0-r0","0.6.3-r0","0.6.4-r0","0.6.5-r0","0.7.0-r0","0.7.1-r0","0.7.2-r0","0.7.3-r0","0.7.3-r1","0.7.4-r0","0.7.5-r0","0.7.5-r1","0.7.5-r2","0.7.5-r3","0.7.6-r0","0.7.6-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-14889.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libssh?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.9.3-r0"}]}],"versions":["0.4.5-r0","0.4.6-r0","0.4.8-r0","0.5.0-r0","0.5.1-r0","0.5.2-r0","0.5.2-r1","0.5.3-r0","0.5.4-r0","0.5.5-r0","0.6.0-r0","0.6.3-r0","0.6.4-r0","0.6.5-r0","0.7.0-r0","0.7.1-r0","0.7.2-r0","0.7.3-r0","0.7.3-r1","0.7.4-r0","0.7.5-r0","0.7.5-r1","0.7.5-r2","0.7.5-r3","0.7.6-r0","0.7.6-r1","0.8.7-r0","0.9.0-r0","0.9.2-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-14889.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.8","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libssh?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.7.6-r1"}]}],"versions":["0.4.5-r0","0.4.6-r0","0.4.8-r0","0.5.0-r0","0.5.1-r0","0.5.2-r0","0.5.2-r1","0.5.3-r0","0.5.4-r0","0.5.5-r0","0.6.0-r0","0.6.3-r0","0.6.4-r0","0.6.5-r0","0.7.0-r0","0.7.1-r0","0.7.2-r0","0.7.3-r0","0.7.3-r1","0.7.4-r0","0.7.5-r0","0.7.5-r1","0.7.5-r2","0.7.5-r3","0.7.6-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-14889.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.9","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libssh?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.7.6-r2"}]}],"versions":["0.4.5-r0","0.4.6-r0","0.4.8-r0","0.5.0-r0","0.5.1-r0","0.5.2-r0","0.5.2-r1","0.5.3-r0","0.5.4-r0","0.5.5-r0","0.6.0-r0","0.6.3-r0","0.6.4-r0","0.6.5-r0","0.7.0-r0","0.7.1-r0","0.7.2-r0","0.7.3-r0","0.7.3-r1","0.7.4-r0","0.7.5-r0","0.7.5-r1","0.7.5-r2","0.7.5-r3","0.7.6-r0","0.7.6-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-14889.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2019-14889"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
