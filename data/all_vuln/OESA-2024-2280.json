  "details": "Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Django 4.2 before 4.2.14 and 5.0 before 5.0.7. urlize and urlizetrunc were subject to a potential denial of service attack via certain inputs with a very large number of brackets.(CVE-2024-38875)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Django 5.0 before 5.0.7 and 4.2 before 4.2.14. The django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend.authenticate() method allows remote attackers to enumerate users via a timing attack involving login requests for users with an unusable password.(CVE-2024-39329)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Django 5.0 before 5.0.7 and 4.2 before 4.2.14. Derived classes of the django.core.files.storage.Storage base class, when they override generate_filename() without replicating the file-path validations from the parent class, potentially allow directory traversal via certain inputs during a save() call. (Built-in Storage sub-classes are unaffected.)(CVE-2024-39330)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Django 5.0 before 5.0.7 and 4.2 before 4.2.14. get_supported_language_variant() was subject to a potential denial-of-service attack when used with very long strings containing specific characters.(CVE-2024-39614)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Django 5.0 before 5.0.8 and 4.2 before 4.2.15. The floatformat template filter is subject to significant memory consumption when given a string representation of a number in scientific notation with a large exponent.(CVE-2024-41989)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Django 5.0 before 5.0.8 and 4.2 before 4.2.15. The urlize() and urlizetrunc() template filters are subject to a potential denial-of-service attack via very large inputs with a specific sequence of characters.(CVE-2024-41990)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Django 5.0 before 5.0.8 and 4.2 before 4.2.15. The urlize and urlizetrunc template filters, and the AdminURLFieldWidget widget, are subject to a potential denial-of-service attack via certain inputs with a very large number of Unicode characters.(CVE-2024-41991)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Django 5.0 before 5.0.8 and 4.2 before 4.2.15. QuerySet.values() and values_list() methods on models with a JSONField are subject to SQL injection in column aliases via a crafted JSON object key as a passed *arg.(CVE-2024-42005)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Django 5.1 before 5.1.1, 5.0 before 5.0.9, and 4.2 before 4.2.16. The urlize() and urlizetrunc() template filters are subject to a potential denial-of-service attack via very large inputs with a specific sequence of characters.(CVE-2024-45230)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Django v5.1.1, v5.0.9, and v4.2.16. The django.contrib.auth.forms.PasswordResetForm class, when used in a view implementing password reset flows, allows remote attackers to enumerate user e-mail addresses by sending password reset requests and observing the outcome (only when e-mail sending is consistently failing).(CVE-2024-45231)",
