In drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_ca_en50221.c, a use-after-free can occur is there is a disconnect after an open, because of the lack of a wait_event.(CVE-2022-45919)\r\n\r\nVUL-0: CVE-2023-2593: kernel: Linux Kernel ksmbd Memory Exhaustion Denial-of-Service Vulnerability(CVE-2023-2593)\r\n\r\nThere is a null-pointer-dereference flaw found in f2fs_write_end_io in fs/f2fs/data.c in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local privileged user to cause a denial of service problem.(CVE-2023-2898)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in drivers/bluetooth/hci_ldisc.c in the Linux kernel 6.2. In hci_uart_tty_ioctl, there is a race condition between HCIUARTSETPROTO and HCIUARTGETPROTO. HCI_UART_PROTO_SET is set before hu-&gt;proto is set. A NULL pointer dereference may occur.(CVE-2023-31083)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in drivers/mtd/ubi/cdev.c in the Linux kernel 6.2. There is a divide-by-zero error in do_div(sz,mtd-&gt;erasesize), used indirectly by ctrl_cdev_ioctl, when mtd-&gt;erasesize is 0.(CVE-2023-31085)\r\n\r\nVUL-0: CVE-2023-32246: kernel: Linux Kernel ksmbd RCU Callback Race Condition Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability(CVE-2023-32246)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel&apos;s ksmbd, a high-performance in-kernel SMB server. The specific flaw exists within the processing of SMB2_TREE_DISCONNECT commands. The issue results from the lack of proper locking when performing operations on an object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the kernel.(CVE-2023-32254)\r\n\r\nClosing of an event channel in the Linux kernel can result in a deadlock. This happens when the close is being performed in parallel to an unrelated Xen console action and the handling of a Xen console interrupt in an unprivileged guest. The closing of an event channel is e.g. triggered by removal of a paravirtual device on the other side. As this action will cause console messages to be issued on the other side quite often, the chance of triggering the deadlock is not neglectable.\nA (malicious) guest administrator could cause a denial of service (DoS) in a backend domain (other than dom0) by disabling a paravirtualized device. A malicious backend could cause DoS in a guest running a Linux kernel by disabling a paravirtualized device.(CVE-2023-34324)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The nfnl_osf_add_callback function did not validate the user mode controlled opt_num field. This flaw allows a local privileged (CAP_NET_ADMIN) attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash or information disclosure.(CVE-2023-39189)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The xt_u32 module did not validate the fields in the xt_u32 structure. This flaw allows a local privileged attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read by setting the size fields with a value beyond the array boundaries, leading to a crash or information disclosure.(CVE-2023-39192)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The sctp_mt_check did not validate the flag_count field. This flaw allows a local privileged (CAP_NET_ADMIN) attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash or information disclosure.(CVE-2023-39193)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the XFRM subsystem in the Linux kernel. The specific flaw exists within the processing of state filters, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. This flaw allows a local privileged (CAP_NET_ADMIN) attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to an information disclosure.(CVE-2023-39194)\r\n\r\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel ipv4 stack. The socket buffer (skb) was assumed to be associated with a device before calling __ip_options_compile, which is not always the case if the skb is re-routed by ipvs. This issue may allow a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to crash the system.(CVE-2023-42754)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in drivers/net/ethernet/intel/igb/igb_main.c in the IGB driver in the Linux kernel before 6.5.3. A buffer size may not be adequate for frames larger than the MTU.(CVE-2023-45871)\r\n\r\nA heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernel&apos;s Linux Kernel Performance Events (perf) component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\r\n\r\nIf perf_read_group() is called while an event&apos;s sibling_list is smaller than its child&apos;s sibling_list, it can increment or write to memory locations outside of the allocated buffer.\r\n\r\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 32671e3799ca2e4590773fd0e63aaa4229e50c06.\r\n\r\n(CVE-2023-5717)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kernel","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/kernel&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["perf-debuginfo-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","kernel-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","kernel-source-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","kernel-devel-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","perf-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","kernel-headers-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["kernel-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["perf-debuginfo-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","kernel-headers-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","kernel-devel-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","perf-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","kernel-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","kernel-source-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-5.10.0-153.31.0.108.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2023-1783.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2023-1783"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-44033"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-45919"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-2593"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-2898"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31083"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31085"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32246"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32254"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34324"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39189"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39192"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39193"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39194"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42754"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45871"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-5717"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Critical"}}
