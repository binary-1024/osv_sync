However, if a second encrypted port on the same IP address (e.g. port 8443) did not opt-in to opportunistic encryption; a network attacker could forward a connection from the browser to port 443 to port 8443, causing the browser to treat the content of port 8443 as same-origin with HTTP. This was resolved by disabling the Opportunistic Encryption feature, which had low usage. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"firefox-esr","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/firefox-esr?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"91.4.1esr-1~deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["78.12.0esr-1","78.13.0esr-1","78.13.0esr-1~deb10u1","78.13.0esr-1~deb11u1","78.13.0esr-1~deb9u1","78.14.0esr-1","78.14.0esr-1~deb10u1","78.14.0esr-1~deb11u1","78.14.0esr-1~deb9u1","78.15.0esr-1~deb10u1","78.15.0esr-1~deb11u1","78.15.0esr-1~deb9u1","91.0.1esr-1","91.0esr-1","91.1.0esr-1","91.2.0esr-1","91.3.0esr-1","91.3.0esr-2","91.4.0esr-1","91.4.1esr-1~deb9u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-38507.json"}},{"package":{"name":"firefox-esr","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/firefox-esr?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"91.3.0esr-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-38507.json"}},{"package":{"name":"firefox-esr","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/firefox-esr?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"91.3.0esr-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-38507.json"}},{"package":{"name":"firefox-esr","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/firefox-esr?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"91.3.0esr-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-38507.json"}},{"package":{"name":"thunderbird","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/thunderbird?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:91.4.1-1~deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["1:78.12.0-1","1:78.13.0-1","1:78.13.0-1~deb10u1","1:78.13.0-1~deb11u1","1:78.13.0-1~deb9u1","1:78.14.0-1","1:78.14.0-1~deb10u1","1:78.14.0-1~deb11u1","1:78.14.0-1~deb9u1","1:84.0~b3-1","1:85.0~b3-1","1:86.0~b3-1","1:88.0~b2-1","1:89.0~b2-1","1:90.0~b2-1","1:91.0-1","1:91.0.2-1","1:91.0~b1-1","1:91.0~b3-1","1:91.0~b5-1","1:91.1.0-1","1:91.1.1-1","1:91.2.0-1","1:91.2.1-1","1:91.3.0-1","1:91.3.2-1","1:91.4.0-1","1:91.4.1-1~deb10u1","1:91.4.1-1~deb9u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-38507.json"}},{"package":{"name":"thunderbird","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/thunderbird?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:91.3.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-38507.json"}},{"package":{"name":"thunderbird","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/thunderbird?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:91.3.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-38507.json"}},{"package":{"name":"thunderbird","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/thunderbird?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:91.3.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-38507.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38507"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
