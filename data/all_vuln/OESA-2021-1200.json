  "details": "Hivex is a library for extracting the contents of Windows Registry &quot;hive&quot; files.  It is designed to be secure against buggy or malicious registry files.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the hivex library in versions before 1.3.20. It is caused due to a lack of bounds check within the hivex_open function. An attacker could input a specially crafted Windows Registry (hive) file which would cause hivex to read memory beyond its normal bounds or cause the program to crash. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-3504)",
