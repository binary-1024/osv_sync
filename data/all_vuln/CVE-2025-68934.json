{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68934","published":"2026-01-28T19:19:59.627Z","modified":"2026-01-29T02:56:25.565988Z","aliases":["GHSA-vwjh-vrx9-9849"],"summary":"Discourse Has Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability in Drafts Creation Endpoint","details":"Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In versions prior to 3.5.4, 2025.11.2, 2025.12.1, and 2026.1.0, authenticated users can submit crafted payloads to /drafts.json that cause O(n^2) processing in Base62.decode, tying up workers for 35-60 seconds per request. This affects all users as the shared worker pool becomes exhausted. This issue is patched in versions 3.5.4, 2025.11.2, 2025.12.1, and 2026.1.0. Lowering the max_draft_length site setting reduces attack surface but does not fully mitigate the issue, as payloads under the limit can still trigger the slow code path.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"78a28cf8d4af429df45c8c48225be125193e5d7a"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.5.4"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse","events":[{"introduced":"75d61b40ee928a4620b16f5438ca886678fab00d"},{"fixed":"f31b18139a7aadbc4a5f7e8e565a6f4376010c3a"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2025.11.0-latest"},{"fixed":"2025.11.2"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse","events":[{"introduced":"322d3c0ac6a8f133b3f82875e9dbbe310f638c1b"},{"fixed":"322d3c0ac6a8f133b3f82875e9dbbe310f638c1b"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2026.1.0-latest"},{"fixed":"2026.1.0"}]}}],"versions":["v2025.11.0","v2025.11.1","v2026.1.0-latest"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68934.json","unresolved_ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":">= 2025.12.0-latest, 2025.12.1"}]}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68934.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-vwjh-vrx9-9849"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68934"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-770"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68934.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
