  "details": "Updated glpi package fixes security vulnerability:\n\nAn issue was discovered in GLPI through 9.2.1. The application is affected by\nXSS in the query string to front/preference.php. An attacker is able to create a\nmalicious URL that, if opened by an authenticated user with debug privilege,\nwill execute JavaScript code supplied by the attacker. The attacker-supplied\ncode can perform a wide variety of actions, such as stealing the victim's\nsession token or login credentials, performing arbitrary actions on the victim's\nbehalf, and logging their keystrokes (CVE-2018-7563).\n",
