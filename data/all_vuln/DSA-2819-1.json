  "details": "\nSecurity support for Iceape, the Debian-branded version of the Seamonkey\nsuite needed to be stopped before the end of the regular security maintenance \nlife cycle.\n\n\nWe recommend to migrate to Iceweasel for the web browser functionality and \nto Icedove for the e-mail bits. Iceweasel and Icedove are based on the same \ncodebase and will continue to be supported with security updates. Alternatively \nyou can switch to the binaries provided by Mozilla available at \n[\\\nhttp://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/](http://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/)\n\n\n",
