  "details": "It was reported that firejail does not respect the end-of-options separator\n(\"--\"), allowing an attacker with control over the command line options of the\nsandboxed application, to write data to a specified file (CVE-2020-17367).\n\nIt was reported that firejail when redirecting output via --output or\n--output-stderr, concatenates all command line arguments into a single string\nthat is passed to a shell. An attacker who has control over the command line\narguments of the sandboxed application could take advantage of this flaw to run\narbitrary commands (CVE-2020-17368).\n",
