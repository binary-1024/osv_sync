This allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code, because those lookup values lead to incorrect length calculations and incorrect memcpy operations.","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lapis-sawfish-be3.notion.site/0-click-Vulnerability-in-Comman-1-43_v3-1cadc00d01d080b0b3b9c46a6da584cc"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/connman/connman.git/tree/src/dnsproxy.c?h=1.44#n1688"}]}
