  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: dwc3: host: Stop setting the ACPI companion  It is no longer needed. The sysdev pointer is now used when assigning the ACPI companions to the xHCI ports and USB devices.  Assigning the ACPI companion here resulted in the fwnode->secondary pointer to be replaced also for the parent dwc3 device since the primary fwnode (the ACPI companion) was shared. That was unintentional and it created potential side effects like resource leaks.",
