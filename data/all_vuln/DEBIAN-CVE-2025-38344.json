I have been doing a research on ACPI and found an ACPI cache leak in ACPI early abort cases.  Boot log of ACPI cache leak is as follows: [    0.352414] ACPI: Added _OSI(Module Device) [    0.353182] ACPI: Added _OSI(Processor Device) [    0.353182] ACPI: Added _OSI(3.0 _SCP Extensions) [    0.353182] ACPI: Added _OSI(Processor Aggregator Device) [    0.356028] ACPI: Unable to start the ACPI Interpreter [    0.356799] ACPI Error: Could not remove SCI handler (20170303/evmisc-281) [    0.360215] kmem_cache_destroy Acpi-State: Slab cache still has objects [    0.360648] CPU: 0 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Tainted: G        W 4.12.0-rc4-next-20170608+ #10 [    0.361273] Hardware name: innotek gmb_h virtual_box/virtual_box, BIOS virtual_box 12/01/2006 [    0.361873] Call Trace: [    0.362243]  ? dump_stack+0x5c/0x81 [    0.362591]  ? kmem_cache_destroy+0x1aa/0x1c0 [    0.362944]  ? acpi_sleep_proc_init+0x27/0x27 [    0.363296]  ? acpi_os_delete_cache+0xa/0x10 [    0.363646]  ? acpi_ut_delete_caches+0x6d/0x7b [    0.364000]  ? acpi_terminate+0xa/0x14 [    0.364000]  ? acpi_init+0x2af/0x34f [    0.364000]  ? __class_create+0x4c/0x80 [    0.364000]  ? video_setup+0x7f/0x7f [    0.364000]  ? acpi_sleep_proc_init+0x27/0x27 [    0.364000]  ? do_one_initcall+0x4e/0x1a0 [    0.364000]  ? kernel_init_freeable+0x189/0x20a [    0.364000]  ? rest_init+0xc0/0xc0 [    0.364000]  ? kernel_init+0xa/0x100 [    0.364000]  ? ret_from_fork+0x25/0x30  I analyzed this memory leak in detail. I found that “Acpi-State” cache and “Acpi-Parse” cache were merged because the size of cache objects was same slab cache size.  I finally found “Acpi-Parse” cache and “Acpi-parse_ext” cache were leaked using SLAB_NEVER_MERGE flag in kmem_cache_create() function.  Real ACPI cache leak point is as follows: [    0.360101] ACPI: Added _OSI(Module Device) [    0.360101] ACPI: Added _OSI(Processor Device) [    0.360101] ACPI: Added _OSI(3.0 _SCP Extensions) [    0.361043] ACPI: Added _OSI(Processor Aggregator Device) [    0.364016] ACPI: Unable to start the ACPI Interpreter [    0.365061] ACPI Error: Could not remove SCI handler (20170303/evmisc-281) [    0.368174] kmem_cache_destroy Acpi-Parse: Slab cache still has objects [    0.369332] CPU: 1 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Tainted: G        W 4.12.0-rc4-next-20170608+ #8 [    0.371256] Hardware name: innotek gmb_h virtual_box/virtual_box, BIOS virtual_box 12/01/2006 [    0.372000] Call Trace: [    0.372000]  ?
