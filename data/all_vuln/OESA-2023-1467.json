  "details": "The Linux Kernel, the operating system core itself.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nIn multiple functions of binder.c, there is a possible memory corruption due to a use after free. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.\r\n\r\n(CVE-2023-21255)\r\n\r\n(CVE-2023-2163)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel&apos;s ksmbd, a high-performance in-kernel SMB server. The specific flaw exists within the handling of SMB2_TREE_CONNECT and SMB2_QUERY_INFO commands. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a pointer prior to accessing it. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition on the system.(CVE-2023-32248)\r\n\r\nVUL-0: CVE-2023-32255: kernel: Linux Kernel ksmbd Session Setup Memory Leak Denial-of-Service Vulnerability(CVE-2023-32255)\r\n\r\nA use-after-free flaw was found in vcs_read in drivers/tty/vt/vc_screen.c in vc_screen in the Linux Kernel. This flaw allows an attacker with local user access to cause a system crash or leak internal kernel information.(CVE-2023-3567)\r\n\r\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel&apos;s net/sched: cls_u32 component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\r\n\r\nIf tcf_change_indev() fails, u32_set_parms() will immediately return an error after incrementing or decrementing the reference counter in tcf_bind_filter(). If an attacker can control the reference counter and set it to zero, they can cause the reference to be freed, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.\r\n\r\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 04c55383fa5689357bcdd2c8036725a55ed632bc.\r\n\r\n(CVE-2023-3609)\r\n\r\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel&apos;s netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\r\n\r\nFlaw in the error handling of bound chains causes a use-after-free in the abort path of NFT_MSG_NEWRULE. The vulnerability requires CAP_NET_ADMIN to be triggered.\r\n\r\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 4bedf9eee016286c835e3d8fa981ddece5338795.\r\n\r\n(CVE-2023-3610)\r\n\r\nAn out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernel&apos;s net/sched: sch_qfq component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\r\n\r\nThe qfq_change_agg() function in net/sched/sch_qfq.c allows an out-of-bounds write because lmax is updated according to packet sizes without bounds checks.\r\n\r\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 3e337087c3b5805fe0b8a46ba622a962880b5d64.\r\n\r\n(CVE-2023-3611)\r\n\r\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel&apos;s net/sched: cls_fw component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\r\n\r\nIf tcf_change_indev() fails, fw_set_parms() will immediately return an error after incrementing or decrementing the reference counter in tcf_bind_filter(). If an attacker can control the reference counter and set it to zero, they can cause the reference to be freed, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.\r\n\r\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 0323bce598eea038714f941ce2b22541c46d488f.\r\n\r\n(CVE-2023-3776)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.4. ksmbd has an out-of-bounds read in smb2_find_context_vals when create_context&apos;s name_len is larger than the tag length.(CVE-2023-38426)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.4. fs/ksmbd/smb2pdu.c in ksmbd does not properly check the UserName value because it does not consider the address of security buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read.(CVE-2023-38428)",
