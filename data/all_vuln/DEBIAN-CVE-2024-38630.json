  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  watchdog: cpu5wdt.c: Fix use-after-free bug caused by cpu5wdt_trigger  When the cpu5wdt module is removing, the origin code uses del_timer() to de-activate the timer. If the timer handler is running, del_timer() could not stop it and will return directly. If the port region is released by release_region() and then the timer handler cpu5wdt_trigger() calls outb() to write into the region that is released, the use-after-free bug will happen.  Change del_timer() to timer_shutdown_sync() in order that the timer handler could be finished before the port region is released.",
