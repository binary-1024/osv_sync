Use of a non-standard PostScript operator can allow overriding of file access controls. The 'rsearch' calculation for the 'post' size resulted in a size that was too large, and could underflow to max uint32_t. This was fixed in commit 5d499272b95a6b890a1397e11d20937de000d31b.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ghostscript","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/ghostscript?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.50-r1"}]}],"versions":["8.64-r0","8.70-r0","8.71-r0","8.71-r1","8.71-r2","8.71-r3","8.71-r4","9.00-r0","9.00-r1","9.00-r2","9.04-r0","9.05-r0","9.05-r1","9.06-r0","9.06-r1","9.06-r2","9.06-r3","9.07-r0","9.09-r0","9.09-r1","9.10-r0","9.10-r1","9.15-r0","9.15-r1","9.16-r0","9.16-r1","9.16-r2","9.18-r0","9.19-r0","9.19-r1","9.20-r0","9.20-r1","9.21-r0","9.21-r1","9.21-r2","9.21-r3","9.22-r0","9.24-r0","9.25-r0","9.25-r1","9.26-r0","9.26-r1","9.26-r2","9.27-r0","9.27-r1","9.27-r2","9.27-r3","9.27-r4","9.50-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-15900.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ghostscript","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/ghostscript?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.52-r1"}]}],"versions":["8.64-r0","8.70-r0","8.71-r0","8.71-r1","8.71-r2","8.71-r3","8.71-r4","9.00-r0","9.00-r1","9.00-r2","9.04-r0","9.05-r0","9.05-r1","9.06-r0","9.06-r1","9.06-r2","9.06-r3","9.07-r0","9.09-r0","9.09-r1","9.10-r0","9.10-r1","9.15-r0","9.15-r1","9.16-r0","9.16-r1","9.16-r2","9.18-r0","9.19-r0","9.19-r1","9.20-r0","9.20-r1","9.21-r0","9.21-r1","9.21-r2","9.21-r3","9.22-r0","9.24-r0","9.25-r0","9.25-r1","9.26-r0","9.26-r1","9.26-r2","9.27-r0","9.27-r1","9.27-r2","9.27-r3","9.27-r4","9.50-r0","9.51-r0","9.52-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-15900.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2020-15900"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
