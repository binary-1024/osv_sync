  "details": "A malicious client can send many DNS messages over TCP, potentially\ncausing the server to become unstable while the attack is in progress.\nThe server may recover after the attack ceases. Use of ACLs will not\nmitigate the attack. (CVE-2024-0760)\nResolver caches and authoritative zone databases that hold significant\nnumbers of RRs for the same hostname (of any RTYPE) can suffer from\ndegraded performance as content is being added or updated, and also when\nhandling client queries for this name. (CVE-2024-1737)\nIf a server hosts a zone containing a \"KEY\" Resource Record, or a\nresolver DNSSEC-validates a \"KEY\" Resource Record from a DNSSEC-signed\ndomain in cache, a client can exhaust resolver CPU resources by sending\na stream of SIG(0) signed requests. (CVE-2024-1975)\nClient queries that trigger serving stale data and that also require\nlookups in local authoritative zone data may result in an assertion\nfailure. (CVE-2024-4076)\n",
