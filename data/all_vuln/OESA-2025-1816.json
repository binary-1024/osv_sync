The Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages specifications are developed by Sun under the Java Community Process.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nAllocation of resources for multipart headers with insufficient limits enabled a DoS vulnerability in Apache Commons FileUpload.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Commons FileUpload: from 1.0 before 1.6; from 2.0.0-M1 before 2.0.0-M4.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to versions 1.6 or 2.0.0-M4, which fix the issue.(CVE-2025-48976)\n\nAuthentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.\u00a0 When using PreResources or PostResources mounted other than at the root of the web application, it was possible to access those resources via an unexpected path. That path was likely not to be protected by the same security constraints as the expected path, allowing those security constraints to be bypassed.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.7, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.41, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.105.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.8, 10.1.42 or 9.0.106, which fix the issue.(CVE-2025-49125)",
