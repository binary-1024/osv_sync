That path was likely not to be protected by the same security constraints as the expected path, allowing those security constraints to be bypassed.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.7, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.41, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.105.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.8, 10.1.42 or 9.0.106, which fix the issue.(CVE-2025-49125)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"tomcat","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/tomcat&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.0.100-5.oe2403sp2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"noarch":["tomcat-9.0.100-5.oe2403sp2.noarch.rpm","tomcat-help-9.0.100-5.oe2403sp2.noarch.rpm","tomcat-jsvc-9.0.100-5.oe2403sp2.noarch.rpm"],"src":["tomcat-9.0.100-5.oe2403sp2.src.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1816.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-1816"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48976"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49125"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
