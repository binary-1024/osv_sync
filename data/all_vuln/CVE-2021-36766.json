The vulnerable code is located within the controllers/single_page/dashboard/system/environment/logging.php Logging::update_logging() method. User input passed through the logFile request parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a call to the file_exists() PHP function. This can be exploited by malicious users to inject arbitrary PHP objects into the application scope (PHP Object Injection via phar:// stream wrapper), allowing them to carry out a variety of attacks, such as executing arbitrary PHP code.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f9c8e08d3651a250f42e0c0a8cc18bc64b42733f"}]}],"versions":["5.7.0","5.7.0.1","5.7.0.3","5.7.0.4","5.7.1","5.7.2","5.7.2.1","5.7.3","5.7.3.1","5.7.4","5.7.4.1","5.7.4.2","5.7.5","5.7.5.1","5.7.5.10","5.7.5.11","5.7.5.12","5.7.5.2","5.7.5.3","5.7.5.4","5.7.5.5","5.7.5.6","5.7.5.7","5.7.5.8","5.7.5.9","8.0","8.0.1","8.0.2","8.0.3","8.1.0","8.2.0","8.2.0RC2","8.2.1","8.3.0","8.3.1","8.3.2","8.4.0","8.4.0RC3","8.4.0RC4","8.4.1","8.4.2","8.4.3","8.4.4","8.4.5","8.5.0","8.5.0RC1","8.5.0RC2","8.5.1","8.5.2","8.5.3","8.5.4","8.5.5","8.5.6RC1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-36766.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/163564/Concrete5-8.5.5-Phar-Deserialization.html"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Jul/36"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/1063039"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
