  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ptp: ocp: fix use-after-free bugs causing by ptp_ocp_watchdog  The ptp_ocp_detach() only shuts down the watchdog timer if it is pending. However, if the timer handler is already running, the timer_delete_sync() is not called. This leads to race conditions where the devlink that contains the ptp_ocp is deallocated while the timer handler is still accessing it, resulting in use-after-free bugs. The following details one of the race scenarios.
