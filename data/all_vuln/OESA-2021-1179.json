A limitation in the implementation of userspace packet parsing can allow a malicious user to send a specially crafted packet causing the resulting megaflow in the kernel to be too wide, potentially causing a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2020-35498)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in multiple versions of OpenvSwitch. Specially crafted LLDP packets can cause memory to be lost when allocating data to handle specific optional TLVs, potentially causing a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2020-27827)\r\n\r\nBuffer overflow in the lldp_decode function in daemon/protocols/lldp.c in lldpd before 0.8.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors involving large management addresses and TLV boundaries.(CVE-2015-8011)",
