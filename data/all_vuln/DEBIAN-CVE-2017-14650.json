It's not exploitable through any Horde application, because the code path to the vulnerability is not used by any Horde code. Custom applications using the Horde_Image library might be affected. This vulnerability affects all versions of Horde_Image from 2.0.0 to 2.5.1, and is fixed in 2.5.2. The problem is missing input validation of the index field in _raw() during construction of an ImageMagick command line.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"php-horde-image","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/php-horde-image?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.5.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2017-14650.json"}},{"package":{"name":"php-horde-image","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/php-horde-image?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.5.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2017-14650.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14650"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
