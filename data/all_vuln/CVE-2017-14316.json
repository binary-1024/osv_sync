The function `alloc_heap_pages` allows callers to specify the first NUMA node that should be used for allocations through the `memflags` parameter; the node is extracted using the `MEMF_get_node` macro. While the function checks to see if the special constant `NUMA_NO_NODE` is specified, it otherwise does not handle the case where `node >= MAX_NUMNODES`. This allows an out-of-bounds access to an internal array.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100818"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039348"},{"type":"FIX","url":"http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-231.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-4050"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/10/msg00009.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX227185"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
