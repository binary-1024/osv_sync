It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++ (or other languages, depending on the chosen implementation). Python is also usable as an extension language for applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use scripting or automation interfaces.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in python. An improperly handled HTTP response in the HTTP client code of python may allow a remote attacker, who controls the HTTP server, to make the client script enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU time. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-3737)\n\nThere s a flaw in urllib s AbstractBasicAuthHandler class. An attacker who controls a malicious HTTP server that an HTTP client (such as web browser) connects to, could trigger a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS) during an authentication request with a specially crafted payload that is sent by the server to the client. The greatest threat that this flaw poses is to application availability.(CVE-2021-3733)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python3&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.9-15.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python3-3.7.9-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-devel-3.7.9-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-debug-3.7.9-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.7.9-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.7.9-15.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["python3-help-3.7.9-15.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["python3-3.7.9-15.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python3-3.7.9-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-devel-3.7.9-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-debug-3.7.9-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.7.9-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.7.9-15.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1401.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python3&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.9-16.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python3-3.7.9-16.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-devel-3.7.9-16.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-debug-3.7.9-16.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.7.9-16.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.7.9-16.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["python3-help-3.7.9-16.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["python3-3.7.9-16.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python3-3.7.9-16.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-devel-3.7.9-16.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-debug-3.7.9-16.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.7.9-16.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.7.9-16.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1401.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1401"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3737"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
