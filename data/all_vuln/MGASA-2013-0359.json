  "details": "Drupal's form API has built-in cross-site request forgery (CSRF)\nvalidation, and also allows any module to perform its own validation on\nthe form. In certain common cases, form validation functions may execute\nunsafe operations (CVE-2013-6385).\n\nDrupal core directly used the mt_rand() pseudorandom number generator for\ngenerating security related strings used in several core modules. It was\nfound that brute force tools could determine the seeds making these\nstrings predictable under certain circumstances (CVE-2013-6386).\n\nImage field descriptions are not properly sanitized before they are\nprinted to HTML, thereby exposing a cross-site scripting vulnerability\n(CVE-2013-6387).\n\nA cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the Color module. A\nmalicious attacker could trick an authenticated administrative user into\nvisiting a page containing specific JavaScript that could lead to a\nreflected cross-site scripting attack via JavaScript execution in CSS\n(CVE-2013-6388).\n\nThe Overlay module displays administrative pages as a layer over the\ncurrent page (using JavaScript), rather than replacing the page in the\nbrowser window. The Overlay module did not sufficiently validate URLs\nprior to displaying their contents, leading to an open redirect\nvulnerability (CVE-2013-6389).\n",
