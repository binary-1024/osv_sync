So a check was missing in zlog_rule_new() while copying the record_name from file_path + 1 which caused the buffer overflow. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to overwrite the zlog_record_fn record_func function pointer to get arbitrary code execution or potentially cause remote code execution (RCE).(CVE-2024-22857)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"zlog","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/zlog&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.15-6.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["zlog-1.2.15-6.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","zlog-debuginfo-1.2.15-6.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","zlog-debugsource-1.2.15-6.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["zlog-1.2.15-6.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["zlog-1.2.15-6.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","zlog-debuginfo-1.2.15-6.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","zlog-debugsource-1.2.15-6.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-2318.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2024-2318"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22857"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Critical"}}
