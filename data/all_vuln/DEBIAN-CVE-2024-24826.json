{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-24826","published":"2024-02-12T23:15:08Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:18:09.389647Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-24826"],"details":"Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.1. The vulnerable function, `QuickTimeVideo::NikonTagsDecoder`, was new in v0.28.0, so Exiv2 versions before v0.28 are _not_ affected. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted video file. In most cases this out of bounds read will result in a crash. This bug is fixed in version v0.28.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"exiv2","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/exiv2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.27.3-3","0.27.3-3+deb11u1","0.27.3-3+deb11u2","0.27.3-3.1","0.27.5-1","0.27.5-2","0.27.5-3","0.27.5-4","0.27.6-1","0.28.0+dfsg-1","0.28.0+dfsg-2","0.28.0+dfsg-3","0.28.0+dfsg-4","0.28.1+dfsg-1","0.28.1+dfsg-2","0.28.1+dfsg-3","0.28.2+dfsg-1","0.28.3+dfsg-1","0.28.3+dfsg-2","0.28.4+dfsg-1","0.28.4+dfsg-2","0.28.5+dfsg-1","0.28.7+dfsg-1","0.28.7+dfsg-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-24826.json"}},{"package":{"name":"exiv2","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/exiv2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.27.6-1","0.28.0+dfsg-1","0.28.0+dfsg-2","0.28.0+dfsg-3","0.28.0+dfsg-4","0.28.1+dfsg-1","0.28.1+dfsg-2","0.28.1+dfsg-3","0.28.2+dfsg-1","0.28.3+dfsg-1","0.28.3+dfsg-2","0.28.4+dfsg-1","0.28.4+dfsg-2","0.28.5+dfsg-1","0.28.7+dfsg-1","0.28.7+dfsg-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-24826.json"}},{"package":{"name":"exiv2","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/exiv2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.28.3+dfsg-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-24826.json"}},{"package":{"name":"exiv2","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/exiv2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.28.3+dfsg-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-24826.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-24826"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
