Refuse to access system inodes linked into directory\nhierarchy and vice versa.(CVE-2023-53695)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, a boundary check vulnerability exists in the SCSI SES (SCSI Enclosure Services) component. The vulnerability involves improper boundary checking of the addl_desc_ptr pointer in the ses_enclosure_data_process() function, which may lead to out-of-bounds accesses.(CVE-2023-7324)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: af_alg - Disallow concurrent writes in af_alg_sendmsg\n\nIssuing two writes to the same af_alg socket is bogus as the\ndata will be interleaved in an unpredictable fashion.  Furthermore,\nconcurrent writes may create inconsistencies in the internal\nsocket state.\n\nDisallow this by adding a new ctx-&gt;write field that indiciates\nexclusive ownership for writing.(CVE-2025-39964)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kernel","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/kernel&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["bpftool-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["kernel-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["bpftool-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2511.4.0.0353.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2768.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2768"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53695"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-7324"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-39964"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
