{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-30193","published":"2025-05-20T12:15:19Z","modified":"2025-11-04T15:33:25.573211Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-30193"],"details":"In some circumstances, when DNSdist is configured to allow an unlimited number of queries on a single, incoming TCP connection from a client, an attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting a TCP exchange that triggers an exhaustion of the stack and a crash of DNSdist, causing a denial of service.  The remedy is: upgrade to the patched 1.9.10 version.  A workaround is to restrict the maximum number of queries on incoming TCP connections to a safe value, like 50, via the setMaxTCPQueriesPerConnection setting.  We would like to thank Renaud Allard for bringing this issue to our attention.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"dnsdist","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dnsdist?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.5.1-3","1.6.0-1","1.6.0-2","1.6.1-1","1.7.0-1","1.7.1-1","1.7.2-1","1.7.2-2","1.7.3-1","1.7.3-2","1.8.0-1","1.8.1-1","1.8.2-1","1.8.2-2","1.8.2-3","1.8.3-1","1.8.3-2","1.8.3-3","1.9.10-1","1.9.3-1","1.9.4-1","1.9.5-1","1.9.6-1","1.9.8-1","1.9.9-1","2.0.0-1","2.0.0-2","2.0.0-3","2.0.0-4","2.0.0-5","2.0.0-6","2.0.0~rc1-1","2.0.0~rc1-2","2.0.0~rc2-1","2.0.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"end-of-life"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-30193.json"}},{"package":{"name":"dnsdist","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dnsdist?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.7.3-2","1.8.0-1","1.8.1-1","1.8.2-1","1.8.2-2","1.8.2-3","1.8.3-1","1.8.3-2","1.8.3-3","1.9.10-1","1.9.3-1","1.9.4-1","1.9.5-1","1.9.6-1","1.9.8-1","1.9.9-1","2.0.0-1","2.0.0-2","2.0.0-3","2.0.0-4","2.0.0-5","2.0.0-6","2.0.0~rc1-1","2.0.0~rc1-2","2.0.0~rc2-1","2.0.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"end-of-life"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-30193.json"}},{"package":{"name":"dnsdist","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dnsdist?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-30193.json"}},{"package":{"name":"dnsdist","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dnsdist?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-30193.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-30193"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
