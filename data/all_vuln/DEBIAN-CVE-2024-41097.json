As such, wrong endpoints types may be used at urb sumbitting stage which in turn triggers a warning in usb_submit_urb().  Fix the issue by verifying that required endpoint types are present for both in and out endpoints, taking into account cmd endpoint type.  Unfortunately, this patch has not been tested on real hardware.
