  "details": "This update for sudo provides the following fix:\n\nSecurity issue fixed:     \n\n- CVE-2019-14287: Fixed an issue where a user with sudo privileges \n  that allowed them to run commands with an arbitrary uid, could \n  run commands as root, despite being forbidden to do so in sudoers\n  (bsc#1153674).\n\nOther issues fixed:     \n\n- Cache resolved group names as calling getgrgid() is expensive and \n  on systems connected to AD with many users, groups or sudo rules \n  it causes sudo to take a long time to run (bsc#1068003).\n- Disable insults by default at build time. For new installations this \n  was done via sudoers file, but when upgrading from previous versions \n  it would accidentally be enabled (bsc#1053911).\n- Enable support for zlib compressed I/O logs (bsc#1058297).\n",
