KVM&apos;s ABI for NMIs that arrive simultanesouly (from KVM&apos;s point of\nview) is to inject one NMI and pend the other.  When using vNMI, KVM pends\nthe second NMI simply by setting V_NMI_PENDING, and lets the CPU do the\nrest (hardware automatically sets V_NMI_BLOCKING when an NMI is injected).\r\n\r\nHowever, if KVM can&apos;t immediately inject an NMI, e.g. because the vCPU is\nin an STI shadow or is running with GIF=0, then KVM will request an NMI\nwindow and trigger the WARN (but still function correctly).\r\n\r\nWhether or not the GIF=0 case makes sense is debatable, as the intent of\nKVM&apos;s behavior is to provide functionality that is as close to real\nhardware as possible.  E.g. if two NMIs are sent in quick succession, the\nprobability of both NMIs arriving in an STI shadow is infinitesimally low\non real hardware, but significantly larger in a virtual environment, e.g.\nif the vCPU is preempted in the STI shadow.  For GIF=0, the argument isn&apos;t\nas clear cut, because the window where two NMIs can collide is much larger\nin bare metal (though still small).\r\n\r\nThat said, KVM should not have divergent behavior for the GIF=0 case based\non whether or not vNMI support is enabled.  And KVM has allowed\nsimultaneous NMIs with GIF=0 for over a decade, since commit 7460fb4a3400\n(&quot;KVM: Fix simultaneous NMIs&quot;).  I.e. KVM&apos;s GIF=0 handling shouldn&apos;t be\nmodified without a *really* good reason to do so, and if KVM&apos;s behavior\nwere to be modified, it should be done irrespective of vNMI support.(CVE-2024-39483)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nserial: sc16is7xx: fix invalid FIFO access with special register set\r\n\r\nWhen enabling access to the special register set, Receiver time-out and\nRHR interrupts can happen.

There are scenarios where LSMs want to deny a process the ability to write particular files, even files that the FSUID of the process owns; but this can currently partially be bypassed using atomic write ioctls in two ways:   - F2FS_IOC_START_ATOMIC_REPLACE + F2FS_IOC_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE can    truncate an inode to size 0  - F2FS_IOC_START_ATOMIC_WRITE + F2FS_IOC_ABORT_ATOMIC_WRITE can revert    changes another process concurrently made to a file  Fix it by requiring FMODE_WRITE for these operations, just like for F2FS_IOC_MOVE_RANGE.

Later, check_helper_mem_access(), under the case of PTR_TO_MAP_VALUE as register base type, it assumes BPF_READ for the subsequent call to check_map_access_type() and given the BPF map is read-only it succeeds.  The helpers really need to be annotated as ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} | MEM_UNINIT when results are written into them as opposed to read out of them. The latter indicates that it&apos;s okay to pass a pointer to uninitialized memory as the memory is written to anyway.  However, ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} is a special case of ARG_PTR_TO_FIXED_SIZE_MEM just with additional alignment requirement. So it is better to just get rid of the ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} special cases altogether and reuse the fixed size memory types. For this, add MEM_ALIGNED to additionally ensure alignment given these helpers write directly into the args via *&lt;ptr&gt; = val. The .arg*_size has been initialized reflecting the actual sizeof(*&lt;ptr&gt;).  MEM_ALIGNED can only be used in combination with MEM_FIXED_SIZE annotated argument types, since in !MEM_FIXED_SIZE cases the verifier does not know the buffer size a priori and therefore cannot blindly write *&lt;ptr&gt; = val.(CVE-2024-49861)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/pm: ensure the fw_info is not null before using it  This resolves the dereference null return value warning reported by Coverity.(CVE-2024-49890)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: lpfc: Validate hdwq pointers before dereferencing in reset/errata paths  When the HBA is undergoing a reset or is handling an errata event, NULL ptr dereference crashes may occur in routines such as lpfc_sli_flush_io_rings(), lpfc_dev_loss_tmo_callbk(), or lpfc_abort_handler().  Add NULL ptr checks before dereferencing hdwq pointers that may have been freed due to operations colliding with a reset or errata event handler.(CVE-2024-49891)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Check null pointers before using dc-&gt;clk_mgr  [WHY &amp; HOW] dc-&gt;clk_mgr is null checked previously in the same function, indicating it might be null.  Passing &quot;dc&quot; to &quot;dc-&gt;hwss.apply_idle_power_optimizations&quot;, which dereferences null &quot;dc-&gt;clk_mgr&quot;. (The function pointer resolves to &quot;dcn35_apply_idle_power_optimizations&quot;.)  This fixes 1 FORWARD_NULL issue reported by Coverity.(CVE-2024-49907)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: avoid NULL pointer dereference  iwl_mvm_tx_skb_sta() and iwl_mvm_tx_mpdu() verify that the mvmvsta pointer is not NULL. It retrieves this pointer using iwl_mvm_sta_from_mac80211, which is dereferencing the ieee80211_sta pointer. If sta is NULL, iwl_mvm_sta_from_mac80211 will dereference a NULL pointer. Fix this by checking the sta pointer before retrieving the mvmsta from it. If sta is not NULL, then mvmsta isn&apos;t either.(CVE-2024-49929)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in more places  For fixing CVE-2023-6270, f98364e92662 (&quot;aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts&quot;) makes tx() calling dev_put() instead of doing in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). It avoids that the tx() runs into use-after-free.  Then Nicolai Stange found more places in aoe have potential use-after-free problem with tx(). e.g. revalidate(), aoecmd_ata_rw(), resend(), probe() and aoecmd_cfg_rsp(). Those functions also use aoenet_xmit() to push packet to tx queue. So they should also use dev_hold() to increase the refcnt of skb-&gt;dev.  On the other hand, moving dev_put() to tx() causes that the refcnt of skb-&gt;dev be reduced to a negative value, because corresponding dev_hold() are not called in revalidate(), aoecmd_ata_rw(), resend(), probe(), and aoecmd_cfg_rsp(). This patch fixed this issue.(CVE-2024-49982)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5: Fix error path in multi-packet WQE transmit  Remove the erroneous unmap in case no DMA mapping was established  The multi-packet WQE transmit code attempts to obtain a DMA mapping for the skb. This could fail, e.g. under memory pressure, when the IOMMU driver just can&apos;t allocate more memory for page tables. While the code tries to handle this in the path below the err_unmap label it erroneously unmaps one entry from the sq&apos;s FIFO list of active mappings. Since the current map attempt failed this unmap is removing some random DMA mapping that might still be required. If the PCI function now presents that IOVA, the IOMMU may assumes a rogue DMA access and e.g. on s390 puts the PCI function in error state.  The erroneous behavior was seen in a stress-test environment that created memory pressure.(CVE-2024-50001)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  exec: don&apos;t WARN for racy path_noexec check  Both i_mode and noexec checks wrapped in WARN_ON stem from an artifact of the previous implementation. They used to legitimately check for the condition, but that got moved up in two commits: 633fb6ac3980 (&quot;exec: move S_ISREG() check earlier&quot;) 0fd338b2d2cd (&quot;exec: move path_noexec() check earlier&quot;)  Instead of being removed said checks are WARN_ON&apos;ed instead, which has some debug value.  However, the spurious path_noexec check is racy, resulting in unwarranted warnings should someone race with setting the noexec flag.  One can note there is more to perm-checking whether execve is allowed and none of the conditions are guaranteed to still hold after they were tested for.  Additionally this does not validate whether the code path did any perm checking to begin with -- it will pass if the inode happens to be regular.  Keep the redundant path_noexec() check even though it&apos;s mindless nonsense checking for guarantee that isn&apos;t given so drop the WARN.  Reword the commentary and do small tidy ups while here.  [brauner: keep redundant path_noexec() check](CVE-2024-50010)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: phy: Remove LED entry from LEDs list on unregister  Commit c938ab4da0eb (&quot;net: phy: Manual remove LEDs to ensure correct ordering&quot;) correctly fixed a problem with using devm_ but missed removing the LED entry from the LEDs list.  This cause kernel panic on specific scenario where the port for the PHY is torn down and up and the kmod for the PHY is removed.  On setting the port down the first time, the assosiacted LEDs are correctly unregistered. The associated kmod for the PHY is now removed. The kmod is now added again and the port is now put up, the associated LED are registered again. On putting the port down again for the second time after these step, the LED list now have 4 elements. With the first 2 already unregistered previously and the 2 new one registered again.  This cause a kernel panic as the first 2 element should have been removed.  Fix this by correctly removing the element when LED is unregistered.(CVE-2024-50023)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: RFCOMM: FIX possible deadlock in rfcomm_sk_state_change  rfcomm_sk_state_change attempts to use sock_lock so it must never be called with it locked but rfcomm_sock_ioctl always attempt to lock it causing the following trace:  ====================================================== WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected 6.8.0-syzkaller-08951-gfe46a7dd189e #0 Not tainted ------------------------------------------------------ syz-executor386/5093 is trying to acquire lock: ffff88807c396258 (sk_lock-AF_BLUETOOTH-BTPROTO_RFCOMM){+.+.}-{0:0}, at: lock_sock include/net/sock.h:1671 [inline] ffff88807c396258 (sk_lock-AF_BLUETOOTH-BTPROTO_RFCOMM){+.+.}-{0:0}, at: rfcomm_sk_state_change+0x5b/0x310 net/bluetooth/rfcomm/sock.c:73  but task is already holding lock: ffff88807badfd28 (&amp;d-&gt;lock){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: __rfcomm_dlc_close+0x226/0x6a0 net/bluetooth/rfcomm/core.c:491(CVE-2024-50044)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fbcon: Fix a NULL pointer dereference issue in fbcon_putcs  syzbot has found a NULL pointer dereference bug in fbcon.

This means that if skb bpf_redirect_neigh() is used with a non-NULL params argument and, subsequently, an XDP redirect is performed using the same bpf_redirect_info struct, the XDP path will get confused and end up crashing, which syzbot managed to trigger.  With the stack-allocated bpf_redirect_info, the structure is no longer shared between the SKB and XDP paths, so the crash doesn&apos;t happen anymore. However, different code paths using identically-numbered flag values in the same struct field still seems like a bit of a mess, so this patch cleans that up by moving the flag definitions together and redefining the three flags in BPF_F_REDIRECT_INTERNAL to not overlap with the flags used for XDP. It also adds a BUILD_BUG_ON() check to make sure the overlap is not re-introduced by mistake.(CVE-2024-50163)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Fix overloading of MEM_UNINIT&apos;s meaning  Lonial reported an issue in the BPF verifier where check_mem_size_reg() has the following code:      if (!tnum_is_const(reg-&gt;var_off))         /* For unprivileged variable accesses, disable raw          * mode so that the program is required to          * initialize all the memory that the helper could          * just partially fill up.          */          meta = NULL;  This means that writes are not checked when the register containing the size of the passed buffer has not a fixed size. Through this bug, a BPF program can write to a map which is marked as read-only, for example, .rodata global maps.  The problem is that MEM_UNINIT&apos;s initial meaning that &quot;the passed buffer to the BPF helper does not need to be initialized&quot; which was added back in commit 435faee1aae9 (&quot;bpf, verifier: add ARG_PTR_TO_RAW_STACK type&quot;) got overloaded over time with &quot;the passed buffer is being written to&quot;.  The problem however is that checks such as the above which were added later via 06c1c049721a (&quot;bpf: allow helpers access to variable memory&quot;) set meta to NULL in order force the user to always initialize the passed buffer to the helper. Due to the current double meaning of MEM_UNINIT, this bypasses verifier write checks to the memory (not boundary checks though) and only assumes the latter memory is read instead.  Fix this by reverting MEM_UNINIT back to its original meaning, and having MEM_WRITE as an annotation to BPF helpers in order to then trigger the BPF verifier checks for writing to memory.  Some notes: check_arg_pair_ok() ensures that for ARG_CONST_SIZE{,_OR_ZERO} we can access fn-&gt;arg_type[arg - 1] since it must contain a preceding ARG_PTR_TO_MEM. For check_mem_reg() the meta argument can be removed altogether since we do check both BPF_READ and BPF_WRITE. Same for the equivalent check_kfunc_mem_size_reg().(CVE-2024-50164)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/vc4: Stop the active perfmon before being destroyed  Upon closing the file descriptor, the active performance monitor is not stopped. Although all perfmons are destroyed in `vc4_perfmon_close_file()`, the active performance monitor&apos;s pointer (`vc4-&gt;active_perfmon`) is still retained.  If we open a new file descriptor and submit a few jobs with performance monitors, the driver will attempt to stop the active performance monitor using the stale pointer in `vc4-&gt;active_perfmon`. However, this pointer is no longer valid because the previous process has already terminated, and all performance monitors associated with it have been destroyed and freed.  To fix this, when the active performance monitor belongs to a given process, explicitly stop it before destroying and freeing it.(CVE-2024-50187)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: phy: dp83869: fix memory corruption when enabling fiber  When configuring the fiber port, the DP83869 PHY driver incorrectly calls linkmode_set_bit() with a bit mask (1 &lt;&lt; 10) rather than a bit number (10). This corrupts some other memory location -- in case of arm64 the priv pointer in the same structure.  Since the advertising flags are updated from supported at the end of the function the incorrect line isn&apos;t needed at all and can be removed.(CVE-2024-50188)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pinctrl: ocelot: fix system hang on level based interrupts  The current implementation only calls chained_irq_enter() and chained_irq_exit() if it detects pending interrupts.  ``` for (i = 0; i &lt; info-&gt;stride; i++) {  uregmap_read(info-&gt;map, id_reg + 4 * i, &amp;reg);  if (!reg)   continue;   chained_irq_enter(parent_chip, desc); ```  However, in case of GPIO pin configured in level mode and the parent controller configured in edge mode, GPIO interrupt might be lowered by the hardware. In the result, if the interrupt is short enough, the parent interrupt is still pending while the GPIO interrupt is cleared; chained_irq_enter() never gets called and the system hangs trying to service the parent interrupt.  Moving chained_irq_enter() and chained_irq_exit() outside the for loop ensures that they are called even when GPIO interrupt is lowered by the hardware.  The similar code with chained_irq_enter() / chained_irq_exit() functions wrapping interrupt checking loop may be found in many other drivers: ``` grep -r -A 10 chained_irq_enter drivers/pinctrl ```(CVE-2024-50196)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/radeon: Fix encoder-&gt;possible_clones  Include the encoder itself in its possible_clones bitmask. In the past nothing validated that drivers were populating possible_clones correctly, but that changed in commit 74d2aacbe840 (&quot;drm: Validate encoder-&gt;possible_clones&quot;). Looks like radeon never got the memo and is still not following the rules 100% correctly.  This results in some warnings during driver initialization: Bogus possible_clones: [ENCODER:46:TV-46] possible_clones=0x4 (full encoder mask=0x7) WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 170 at drivers/gpu/drm/drm_mode_config.c:615 drm_mode_config_validate+0x113/0x39c ...

There are two reasons for this: first, the parameter value passed is greater than ocfs2_max_inline_data_with_xattr, second, the start and end parameters of ocfs2_truncate_inline are &quot;unsigned int&quot;.  So, we need to add a sanity check for byte_start and byte_len right before ocfs2_truncate_inline() in ocfs2_remove_inode_range(), if they are greater than ocfs2_max_inline_data_with_xattr return -EINVAL.(CVE-2024-50218)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iov_iter: fix copy_page_from_iter_atomic() if KMAP_LOCAL_FORCE_MAP  generic/077 on x86_32 CONFIG_DEBUG_KMAP_LOCAL_FORCE_MAP=y with highmem, on huge=always tmpfs, issues a warning and then hangs (interruptibly):  WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 3517 at mm/highmem.c:622 kunmap_local_indexed+0x62/0xc9 CPU: 5 UID: 0 PID: 3517 Comm: cp Not tainted 6.12.0-rc4 #2 ... copy_page_from_iter_atomic+0xa6/0x5ec generic_perform_write+0xf6/0x1b4 shmem_file_write_iter+0x54/0x67  Fix copy_page_from_iter_atomic() by limiting it in that case (include/linux/skbuff.h skb_frag_must_loop() does similar).

That led to cxl_test crashing with a use-after-free bug with the following signature:      cxl_port_attach_region: cxl region3: cxl_host_bridge.0:port3 decoder3.0 add: mem0:decoder7.0 @ 0 next: cxl_switch_uport.0 nr_eps: 1 nr_targets: 1     cxl_port_attach_region: cxl region3: cxl_host_bridge.0:port3 decoder3.0 add: mem4:decoder14.0 @ 1 next: cxl_switch_uport.0 nr_eps: 2 nr_targets: 1     cxl_port_setup_targets: cxl region3: cxl_switch_uport.0:port6 target[0] = cxl_switch_dport.0 for mem0:decoder7.0 @ 0 1)  cxl_port_setup_targets: cxl region3: cxl_switch_uport.0:port6 target[1] = cxl_switch_dport.4 for mem4:decoder14.0 @ 1     [..]     cxld_unregister: cxl decoder14.0:     cxl_region_decode_reset: cxl_region region3:     mock_decoder_reset: cxl_port port3: decoder3.0 reset 2)  mock_decoder_reset: cxl_port port3: decoder3.0: out of order reset, expected decoder3.1     cxl_endpoint_decoder_release: cxl decoder14.0:     [..]     cxld_unregister: cxl decoder7.0: 3)  cxl_region_decode_reset: cxl_region region3:     Oops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0x6b6b6b6b6b6b6bc3: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI     [..]     RIP: 0010:to_cxl_port+0x8/0x60 [cxl_core]     [..]     Call Trace:      &lt;TASK&gt;      cxl_region_decode_reset+0x69/0x190 [cxl_core]      cxl_region_detach+0xe8/0x210 [cxl_core]      cxl_decoder_kill_region+0x27/0x40 [cxl_core]      cxld_unregister+0x5d/0x60 [cxl_core]  At 1) a region has been established with 2 endpoint decoders (7.0 and 14.0). Those endpoints share a common switch-decoder in the topology (3.0). At teardown, 2), decoder14.0 is the first to be removed and hits the &quot;out of order reset case&quot; in the switch decoder. The effect though is that region3 cleanup is aborted leaving it in-tact and referencing decoder14.0. At 3) the second attempt to teardown region3 trips over the stale decoder14.0 object which has long since been deleted.  The fix here is to recognize that the CXL specification places no mandate on in-order shutdown of switch-decoders, the driver enforces in-order allocation, and hardware enforces in-order commit. So, rather than fail and leave objects dangling, always remove them.  In support of making cxl_region_decode_reset() always succeed, cxl_region_invalidate_memregion() failures are turned into warnings. Crashing the kernel is ok there since system integrity is at risk if caches cannot be managed around physical address mutation events like CXL region destruction.  A new device_for_each_child_reverse_from() is added to cleanup port-&gt;commit_end after all dependent decoders have been disabled. In other words if decoders are allocated 0-&gt;1-&gt;2 and disabled 1-&gt;2-&gt;0 then port-&gt;commit_end only decrements from 2 after 2 has been disabled, and it decrements all the way to zero since 1 was disabled previously.(CVE-2024-50226)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix potential deadlock with newly created symlinks  Syzbot reported that page_symlink(), called by nilfs_symlink(), triggers memory reclamation involving the filesystem layer, which can result in circular lock dependencies among the reader/writer semaphore nilfs-&gt;ns_segctor_sem, s_writers percpu_rwsem (intwrite) and the fs_reclaim pseudo lock.  This is because after commit 21fc61c73c39 (&quot;don&apos;t put symlink bodies in pagecache into highmem&quot;), the gfp flags of the page cache for symbolic links are overwritten to GFP_KERNEL via inode_nohighmem().  This is not a problem for symlinks read from the backing device, because the __GFP_FS flag is dropped after inode_nohighmem() is called.  However, when a new symlink is created with nilfs_symlink(), the gfp flags remain overwritten to GFP_KERNEL.  Then, memory allocation called from page_symlink() etc.  triggers memory reclamation including the FS layer, which may call nilfs_evict_inode() or nilfs_dirty_inode().  And these can cause a deadlock if they are called while nilfs-&gt;ns_segctor_sem is held:  Fix this issue by dropping the __GFP_FS flag from the page cache GFP flags of newly created symlinks in the same way that nilfs_new_inode() and __nilfs_read_inode() do, as a workaround until we adopt nofs allocation scope consistently or improve the locking constraints.(CVE-2024-50229)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: cfg80211: clear wdev-&gt;cqm_config pointer on free  When we free wdev-&gt;cqm_config when unregistering, we also need to clear out the pointer since the same wdev/netdev may get re-registered in another network namespace, then destroyed later, running this code again, which results in a double-free.(CVE-2024-50235)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netdevsim: Add trailing zero to terminate the string in nsim_nexthop_bucket_activity_write()  This was found by a static analyzer. We should not forget the trailing zero after copy_from_user() if we will further do some string operations, sscanf() in this case. Adding a trailing zero will ensure that the function performs properly.(CVE-2024-50259)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  macsec: Fix use-after-free while sending the offloading packet  KASAN reports the following UAF. The metadata_dst, which is used to store the SCI value for macsec offload, is already freed by metadata_dst_free() in macsec_free_netdev(), while driver still use it for sending the packet.  To fix this issue, dst_release() is used instead to release metadata_dst. So it is not freed instantly in macsec_free_netdev() if still referenced by skb.

This case isn&apos;t very common, however, so defer it to a workqueue.  The oops looks something like:    BUG: spinlock recursion on CPU#0, krxrpcio/7001/1646    lock: 0xffff888141399b30, .magic: dead4ead, .owner: krxrpcio/7001/1646, .owner_cpu: 0   CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID:
