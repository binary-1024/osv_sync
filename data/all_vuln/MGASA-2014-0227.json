  "summary": "Updated kernel-rt packages fix multiple vulnerabilities",
  "details": "Updated kernel-rt provides upstream 3.12.20 kernel and fixes the\nfollowing security issues:\n\nThe ioapic_deliver function in virt/kvm/ioapic.c in the Linux kernel\nthrough 3.14.1 does not properly validate the kvm_irq_delivery_to_apic\nreturn value, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service\n(host OS crash) via a crafted entry in the redirection table of an I/O\nAPIC. NOTE: the affected code was moved to the ioapic_service function\nbefore the vulnerability was announced. (CVE-2014-0155)\n\nThe n_tty_write function in drivers/tty/n_tty.c in the Linux kernel\nthrough 3.14.3 does not properly manage tty driver access in the\n\"LECHO & !OPOST\" case, which allows local users to cause a denial of\nservice (memory corruption and system crash) or gain privileges by\ntriggering a race condition involving read and write operations with\nlong strings. (CVE-2014-0196)\n\nThe raw_cmd_copyin function in drivers/block/floppy.c in the Linux\nkernel through 3.14.3 does not properly handle error conditions during\nprocessing of an FDRAWCMD ioctl call, which allows local users to trigger\nkfree operations and gain privileges by leveraging write access to a\n/dev/fd device.  (CVE-2014-1737)\n\nThe raw_cmd_copyout function in drivers/block/floppy.c in the Linux\nkernel through 3.14.3 does not properly restrict access to certain\npointers during processing of an FDRAWCMD ioctl call, which allows\nlocal users to obtain sensitive information from kernel heap memory\nby leveraging write access to a /dev/fd device. (CVE-2014-1738)\n\nThe -rt patch has been updated to rt30.\n\nFor other fixes, see the referenced changelogs.\n",
