  "summary": "[TagAwareCipher] - Decryption Failure (Regex Match)",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nVulnerability in **SecureProps** involves a regex failing to detect tags during decryption of encrypted data. \n\nThis occurs when the encrypted data has been encoded with `NullEncoder` and passed to `TagAwareCipher`, and contains special characters such as `\\n`. As a result, the decryption process is skipped since the tags are not detected. This causes the encrypted data to be returned in plain format. \n\nThe vulnerability affects users who implement `TagAwareCipher` with any base cipher that has `NullEncoder` (not default).\n\n### Patches\n\nThe patch for the issue has been released. Users are advised to update to version **1.2.2**.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n**The main recommendation is to update to the latest version as there are no breaking changes.**\n\nIf that's not possible, you can use the default `Base64Encoder` with the base cipher decorated with `TagAwareCipher` to prevent special characters in the encrypted string from interfering with regex tag detection logic. \n\nThis workaround is safe but may involve double encoding since `TagAwareCipher` uses `Base64Encoder` by default.\n \n### References\n\nReported issue: https://github.com/IlicMiljan/Secure-Props/issues/20\nPull request resolving bug: https://github.com/IlicMiljan/Secure-Props/pull/21\n",
