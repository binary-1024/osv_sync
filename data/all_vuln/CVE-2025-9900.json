This vulnerability is a \"write-what-where\" condition, triggered when the library processes a specially crafted TIFF image file.\n\nBy providing an abnormally large image height value in the file's metadata, an attacker can trick the library into writing attacker-controlled color data to an arbitrary memory location. This memory corruption can be exploited to cause a denial of service (application crash) or to achieve arbitrary code execution with the permissions of the user.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:17651"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:17675"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:17710"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:17738"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:17739"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:17740"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/SexyShoelessGodofWar/LibTiff-4.7.0-Write-What-Where?tab=readme-ov-file"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2392784"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-9900"}]}
