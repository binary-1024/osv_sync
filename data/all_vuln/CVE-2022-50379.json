  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix race between quota enable and quota rescan ioctl\n\nWhen enabling quotas, at btrfs_quota_enable(), after committing the\ntransaction, we change fs_info->quota_root to point to the quota root we\ncreated and set BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED at fs_info->flags. Then we try\nto start the qgroup rescan worker, first by initializing it with a call\nto qgroup_rescan_init() - however if that fails we end up freeing the\nquota root but we leave fs_info->quota_root still pointing to it, this\ncan later result in a use-after-free somewhere else.\n\nWe have previously set the flags BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED and\nBTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_FLAG_ON, so we can only fail with -EINPROGRESS at\nbtrfs_quota_enable(), which is possible if someone already called the\nquota rescan ioctl, and therefore started the rescan worker.\n\nSo fix this by ignoring an -EINPROGRESS and asserting we can't get any\nother error.",
