Prior to versions 4.22.0 and 3.3.8, the current rule 922110 has a bug when processing multipart requests with multiple parts. When the first rule in a chain iterates over a collection (like `MULTIPART_PART_HEADERS`), the capture variables (`TX:0`, `TX:1`) get overwritten with each iteration. Only the last captured value is available to the chained rule, which means malicious charsets in earlier parts can be missed if a later part has a legitimate charset.
