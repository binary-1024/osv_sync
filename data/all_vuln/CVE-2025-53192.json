Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.\n\n\nNOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.","references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/2gj8tjl6vz949nnp3yxz3okm9xz2k7sp"}]}
