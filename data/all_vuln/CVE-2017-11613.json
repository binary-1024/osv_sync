A crafted input will lead to a denial of service attack. During the TIFFOpen process, td_imagelength is not checked. The value of td_imagelength can be directly controlled by an input file. In the ChopUpSingleUncompressedStrip function, the _TIFFCheckMalloc function is called based on td_imagelength. If we set the value of td_imagelength close to the amount of system memory, it will hang the system or trigger the OOM killer.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vadz/libtiff","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"4a25fa0efc03a4e71740efc748c24b93152b1807"}]}],"versions":["Pre360","Release-","Release-3-7-0","Release-v3-5-","Release-v3-5-4","Release-v3-5-5","Release-v3-5-7","Release-v3-6-0","Release-v3-6-0beta2","Release-v3-6-1","Release-v3-7-0-alpha","Release-v3-7-0beta","Release-v3-7-0beta2","Release-v3-7-1","Release-v3-7-2","Release-v3-7-3","Release-v3-7-4","Release-v3-8-0","Release-v3-8-1","Release-v3-8-2","Release-v4-0-0","Release-v4-0-0alpha","Release-v4-0-0alpha4","Release-v4-0-0alpha5","Release-v4-0-0alpha6","Release-v4-0-0beta7","Release-v4-0-1","Release-v4-0-2","Release-v4-0-3","Release-v4-0-4","Release-v4-0-4beta","Release-v4-0-5","Release-v4-0-6","Release-v4-0-7","Release-v4-0-8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-11613.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/05/msg00022.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/07/msg00002.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3606-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99977"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://gist.github.com/dazhouzhou/1a3b7400547f23fe316db303ab9b604f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4349"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
