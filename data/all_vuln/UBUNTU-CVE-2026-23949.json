The vulnerability may allow attackers to extract files outside the intended extraction directory when malicious tar archives are processed. The strip_first_component filter splits the path on the first `/` and extracts the second component, while allowing `../` sequences. Paths like `dummy_dir/../../etc/passwd` become `../../etc/passwd`. Note that this suffers from a nested tarball attack as well with multi-level tar files such as `dummy_dir/inner.tar.gz`, where the inner.tar.gz includes a traversal `dummy_dir/../../config/.env` that also gets translated to `../../config/.env`. Version 6.1.0 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"jaraco.context","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.10","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/jaraco.context@6.0.1-1?arch=source&distro=questing"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.0.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"python3-jaraco.context","binary_version":"6.0.1-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2026/UBUNTU-CVE-2026-23949.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2026-23949"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23949"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/jaraco/jaraco.context/security/advisories/GHSA-58pv-8j8x-9vj2"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/jaraco/jaraco.context/blob/main/jaraco/context/__init__.py#L74-L91"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/main/setuptools/_vendor/jaraco/context.py#L55-L76"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
