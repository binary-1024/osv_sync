By wrapping HTTP requests and responses in the simplest way possible, it unifies and distills the API for web servers,  web frameworks, and software in between (the so-called middleware) into  a single method call.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA denial of service vulnerability in the multipart parsing component of Rack fixed in 2.0.9.2, 2.1.4.2, 2.2.4.1 and 3.0.0.1 could allow an attacker tocraft input that can cause RFC2183 multipart boundary parsing in Rack to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a denial of service attack vector. Any applications that parse multipart posts using Rack (virtually all Rails applications) are impacted.(CVE-2022-44572)\r\n\r\nRack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Carefully crafted Range headers can cause a server to respond with an unexpectedly large response. Responding with such large responses could lead to a denial of service issue. Vulnerable applications will use the `Rack::File` middleware or the `Rack::Utils.byte_ranges` methods (this includes Rails applications). The vulnerability is fixed in 3.0.9.1 and 2.2.8.1.(CVE-2024-26141)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"rubygem-rack","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/rubygem-rack&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.2.3.1-5.oe2203sp3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"noarch":["rubygem-rack-2.2.3.1-5.oe2203sp3.noarch.rpm","rubygem-rack-help-2.2.3.1-5.oe2203sp3.noarch.rpm"],"src":["rubygem-rack-2.2.3.1-5.oe2203sp3.src.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-1823.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2024-1823"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-44572"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26141"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
