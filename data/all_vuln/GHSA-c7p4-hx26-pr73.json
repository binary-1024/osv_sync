  "details": "### Overview\nThe authentication tag of encrypted JWEs can be brute forced, which may result in loss of confidentiality for those JWEs and provide ways to craft arbitrary JWEs.\n\n### Impact\n- JWEs can be modified to decrypt to an arbitrary value\n- JWEs can be decrypted by observing parsing differences\n- The GCM internal [GHASH key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode#:~:text=\\)%20is%20the-,hash%20key,-%2C%20a%20string%20of) can be recovered\n\n\n### Am I Affected?\nYou are affected by this vulnerability even if you do not use an `AES-GCM` encryption algorithm for your JWEs.\n\n### Patches\nThe version 1.1.1 fixes the issue by adding the tag length check for the `AES-GCM` algorithm.\n\n**Important:** As the [GHASH key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode#:~:text=\\)%20is%20the-,hash%20key,-%2C%20a%20string%20of) could have leaked, you must rotate the encryption keys after upgrading to version 1.1.1.\n\n### References\n[F\u00e9lix Charette talk at NorthSec 2025 about the issue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IT659uUXfs&t=15830s)",
