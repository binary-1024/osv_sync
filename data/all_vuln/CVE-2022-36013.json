When `mlir::tfg::GraphDefImporter::ConvertNodeDef` tries to convert NodeDefs without an op name, it crashes. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit a0f0b9a21c9270930457095092f558fbad4c03e5. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a0f0b9a21c9270930457095092f558fbad4c03e5"}]}],"versions":["0.12.0-rc0","0.12.0-rc1","0.12.1","0.5.0","0.6.0","v0.10.0","v0.10.0rc0","v0.11.0","v0.11.0rc0","v0.11.0rc1","v0.11.0rc2","v0.12.0","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.8.0rc0","v0.9.0","v0.9.0rc0","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-alpha","v1.0.0-rc0","v1.0.0-rc1","v1.0.0-rc2","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-rc0","v1.1.0-rc1","v1.1.0-rc2","v1.12.0","v1.12.0-rc0","v1.12.0-rc1","v1.12.0-rc2","v1.12.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-rc0","v1.2.0-rc1","v1.2.0-rc2","v1.3.0-rc0","v1.3.0-rc1","v1.5.0","v1.5.0-rc0","v1.5.0-rc1","v1.6.0","v1.6.0-rc0","v1.6.0-rc1","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-rc0","v1.7.0-rc1","v1.8.0","v1.8.0-rc0","v1.8.0-rc1","v1.9.0","v1.9.0-rc0","v1.9.0-rc1","v1.9.0-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-36013.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"51239811436014073280770888671338672626","length":4511},"id":"CVE-2022-36013-bd637f15","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a0f0b9a21c9270930457095092f558fbad4c03e5","target":{"file":"tensorflow/core/ir/importexport/graphdef_import.cc","function":"GraphDefImporter::ConvertNodeDef"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["790659744776829276776556322096194266","232853806435493033202740849310392297552","97307575777347926028949200864640644069","93685877615814527509098508382099768527"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2022-36013-e2de5759","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a0f0b9a21c9270930457095092f558fbad4c03e5","target":{"file":"tensorflow/core/ir/importexport/graphdef_import.cc"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/36xxx/CVE-2022-36013.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/ir/importexport/graphdef_import.cc"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a0f0b9a21c9270930457095092f558fbad4c03e5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-828c-5j5q-vrjq"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36013"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-476"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/36xxx/CVE-2022-36013.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
