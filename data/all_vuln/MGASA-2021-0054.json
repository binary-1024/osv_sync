  "details": "It was discovered that pip did not properly sanitize the filename during pip\ninstall. A remote attacker could possible use this issue to read and write\narbitrary files on the host filesystem as root, resulting in a directory\ntraversal attack (CVE-2019-20916).\n\nurllib3 before 1.25.9 allows CRLF injection if the attacker controls the HTTP\nrequest method, as demonstrated by inserting CR and LF control characters in\nthe first argument of putrequest(). The python-pip package bundles a copy of\npython-urllib3, which was affected by this issue.  The bundled copy was\npatched to fix the issue (CVE-2020-26137).\n",
