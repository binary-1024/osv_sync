But it can be possible that a driver has a bug and did not set some of the fields, which leads to drm_copy_field() attempting to copy a NULL pointer:  [ +10.395966] Unable to handle kernel access to user memory outside uaccess routines at virtual address 0000000000000000 [  +0.010955] Mem abort info: [  +0.002835]   ESR = 0x0000000096000004 [  +0.003872]   EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits [  +0.005395]   SET = 0, FnV = 0 [  +0.003113]   EA = 0, S1PTW = 0 [  +0.003182]   FSC = 0x04: level 0 translation fault [  +0.004964] Data abort info: [  +0.002919]   ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000004 [  +0.003886]   CM = 0, WnR = 0 [  +0.003040] user pgtable: 4k pages, 48-bit VAs, pgdp=0000000115dad000 [  +0.006536] [0000000000000000] pgd=0000000000000000, p4d=0000000000000000 [  +0.006925] Internal error: Oops: 96000004 [#1] SMP ...
