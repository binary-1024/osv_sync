{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2024-47600","published":"2024-12-12T02:03:31.577Z","modified":"2025-11-19T06:21:13.821060Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-47600"],"details":"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read vulnerability has been detected in the format_channel_mask function in gst-discoverer.c. The vulnerability affects the local array position, which is defined with a fixed size of 64 elements. However, the function gst_discoverer_audio_info_get_channels may return a guint channels value greater than 64. This causes the for loop to attempt access beyond the bounds of the position array, resulting in an OOB-read when an index greater than 63 is used. This vulnerability can result in reading unintended bytes from the stack. Additionally, the dereference of value->value_nick after the OOB-read can lead to further memory corruption or undefined behavior. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-base","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gst-plugins-base?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.24.10-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0-r0","1.0.1-r0","1.0.10-r0","1.0.2-r0","1.0.3-r0","1.0.4-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.6-r0","1.0.7-r0","1.0.8-r0","1.0.9-r0","1.10.4-r0","1.10.4-r1","1.12.0-r0","1.12.1-r0","1.12.1-r1","1.12.1-r2","1.12.3-r0","1.12.3-r1","1.14.0-r0","1.14.0-r1","1.14.1-r0","1.14.2-r0","1.14.4-r0","1.16.0-r0","1.16.1-r0","1.16.2-r0","1.16.2-r1","1.16.2-r2","1.16.2-r3","1.18.1-r0","1.18.2-r0","1.18.3-r0","1.18.4-r0","1.18.4-r1","1.18.5-r0","1.18.6-r0","1.2.0-r0","1.2.1-r0","1.2.2-r0","1.2.3-r0","1.2.4-r0","1.20.1-r0","1.20.2-r0","1.20.3-r0","1.20.3-r1","1.20.4-r0","1.20.4-r1","1.20.5-r0","1.22.0-r0","1.22.0-r1","1.22.1-r0","1.22.1-r1","1.22.11-r0","1.22.2-r0","1.22.3-r0","1.22.4-r0","1.22.5-r0","1.22.6-r0","1.22.7-r0","1.22.8-r0","1.24.3-r0","1.24.9-r0","1.4.0-r0","1.4.1-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.4.3-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.6.1-r0","1.6.3-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.8.1-r0","1.8.1-r1","1.8.1-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-47600.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-base","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gst-plugins-base?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.24.10-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0-r0","1.0.1-r0","1.0.10-r0","1.0.2-r0","1.0.3-r0","1.0.4-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.6-r0","1.0.7-r0","1.0.8-r0","1.0.9-r0","1.10.4-r0","1.10.4-r1","1.12.0-r0","1.12.1-r0","1.12.1-r1","1.12.1-r2","1.12.3-r0","1.12.3-r1","1.14.0-r0","1.14.0-r1","1.14.1-r0","1.14.2-r0","1.14.4-r0","1.16.0-r0","1.16.1-r0","1.16.2-r0","1.16.2-r1","1.16.2-r2","1.16.2-r3","1.18.1-r0","1.18.2-r0","1.18.3-r0","1.18.4-r0","1.18.4-r1","1.18.5-r0","1.18.6-r0","1.2.0-r0","1.2.1-r0","1.2.2-r0","1.2.3-r0","1.2.4-r0","1.20.1-r0","1.20.2-r0","1.20.3-r0","1.20.3-r1","1.20.4-r0","1.20.4-r1","1.20.5-r0","1.22.0-r0","1.22.0-r1","1.22.1-r0","1.22.1-r1","1.22.11-r0","1.22.2-r0","1.22.3-r0","1.22.4-r0","1.22.5-r0","1.22.6-r0","1.22.7-r0","1.22.8-r0","1.24.3-r0","1.24.4-r0","1.24.5-r0","1.24.7-r0","1.24.8-r0","1.24.9-r0","1.4.0-r0","1.4.1-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.4.3-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.6.1-r0","1.6.3-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.8.1-r0","1.8.1-r1","1.8.1-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-47600.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gst-plugins-base","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gst-plugins-base?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.24.10-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0-r0","1.0.1-r0","1.0.10-r0","1.0.2-r0","1.0.3-r0","1.0.4-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.6-r0","1.0.7-r0","1.0.8-r0","1.0.9-r0","1.10.4-r0","1.10.4-r1","1.12.0-r0","1.12.1-r0","1.12.1-r1","1.12.1-r2","1.12.3-r0","1.12.3-r1","1.14.0-r0","1.14.0-r1","1.14.1-r0","1.14.2-r0","1.14.4-r0","1.16.0-r0","1.16.1-r0","1.16.2-r0","1.16.2-r1","1.16.2-r2","1.16.2-r3","1.18.1-r0","1.18.2-r0","1.18.3-r0","1.18.4-r0","1.18.4-r1","1.18.5-r0","1.18.6-r0","1.2.0-r0","1.2.1-r0","1.2.2-r0","1.2.3-r0","1.2.4-r0","1.20.1-r0","1.20.2-r0","1.20.3-r0","1.20.3-r1","1.20.4-r0","1.20.4-r1","1.20.5-r0","1.22.0-r0","1.22.0-r1","1.22.1-r0","1.22.1-r1","1.22.11-r0","1.22.2-r0","1.22.3-r0","1.22.4-r0","1.22.5-r0","1.22.6-r0","1.22.7-r0","1.22.8-r0","1.24.3-r0","1.24.4-r0","1.24.5-r0","1.24.7-r0","1.24.8-r0","1.24.9-r0","1.4.0-r0","1.4.1-r0","1.4.2-r0","1.4.3-r0","1.4.4-r0","1.5.2-r0","1.6.1-r0","1.6.3-r0","1.8.0-r0","1.8.1-r0","1.8.1-r1","1.8.1-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-47600.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2024-47600"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"}]}
