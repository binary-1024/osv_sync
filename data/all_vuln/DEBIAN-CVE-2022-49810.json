It *should* call xas_retry() as the first thing inside of the loop and do \"continue\" if it returns true in case the xarray walker passed out a special value indicating that the walk needs to be redone from the root[*].  Fix this by adding the missing retry checks.  [*] I wonder if this should be done inside xas_find(), xas_next_node() and     suchlike, but I'm told that's not an simple change to effect.  This can cause an oops like that below.  Note the faulting address - this is an internal value (|0x2) returned from xarray.  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000402 ...
