  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowercap: arm_scmi: Remove recursion while parsing zones\n\nPowercap zones can be defined as arranged in a hierarchy of trees and when\nregistering a zone with powercap_register_zone(), the kernel powercap\nsubsystem expects this to happen starting from the root zones down to the\nleaves; on the other side, de-registration by powercap_deregister_zone()\nmust begin from the leaf zones.\n\nAvailable SCMI powercap zones are retrieved dynamically from the platform\nat probe time and, while any defined hierarchy between the zones is\ndescribed properly in the zones descriptor, the platform returns the\navailables zones with no particular well-defined order: as a consequence,\nthe trees possibly composing the hierarchy of zones have to be somehow\nwalked properly to register the retrieved zones from the root.\n\nCurrently the ARM SCMI Powercap driver walks the zones using a recursive\nalgorithm; this approach, even though correct and tested can lead to kernel\nstack overflow when processing a returned hierarchy of zones composed by\nparticularly high trees.\n\nAvoid possible kernel stack overflow by substituting the recursive approach\nwith an iterative one supported by a dynamically allocated stack-like data\nstructure.",
