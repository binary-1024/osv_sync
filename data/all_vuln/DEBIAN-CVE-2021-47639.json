{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2021-47639","published":"2025-02-26T06:37:05Z","modified":"2025-10-14T04:01:09Z","upstream":["CVE-2021-47639"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: x86/mmu: Zap _all_ roots when unmapping gfn range in TDP MMU  Zap both valid and invalid roots when zapping/unmapping a gfn range, as KVM must ensure it holds no references to the freed page after returning from the unmap operation.  Most notably, the TDP MMU doesn't zap invalid roots in mmu_notifier callbacks.  This leads to use-after-free and other issues if the mmu_notifier runs to completion while an invalid root zapper yields as KVM fails to honor the requirement that there must be _no_ references to the page after the mmu_notifier returns.  The bug is most easily reproduced by hacking KVM to cause a collision between set_nx_huge_pages() and kvm_mmu_notifier_release(), but the bug exists between kvm_mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_start() and memslot updates as well.  Invalidating a root ensures pages aren't accessible by the guest, and KVM won't read or write page data itself, but KVM will trigger e.g. kvm_set_pfn_dirty() when zapping SPTEs, and thus completing a zap of an invalid root _after_ the mmu_notifier returns is fatal.
