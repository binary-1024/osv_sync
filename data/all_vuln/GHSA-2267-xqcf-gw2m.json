These files are later rendered by the application without sufficient sanitization or content-type enforcement, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution when the file is accessed.\n\nBecause product files uploaded by regular users are visible to administrative users, this vulnerability can be leveraged to execute malicious JavaScript in an administrator’s browser session.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"facturascripts/facturascripts","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/facturascripts/facturascripts"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"2025.4"}]}],"versions":["2018.03","2018.04","2018.05","2018.11","v2018.12","v2018.13","v2018.14","v2018.15","v2018.16","v2020.01","v2020.2","v2020.3","v2020.4","v2020.51","v2020.61","v2020.71","v2020.80","v2021","v2021.1","v2021.2","v2021.4","v2021.51","v2021.71","v2021.81","v2022.06","v2022.08","v2022.2","v2022.4","v2022.51","v2023.03","v2023.08","v2023.16","v2023.21","v2024","v2024.1","v2024.2","v2024.3","v2024.5","v2024.7","v2024.8","v2024.9","v2024.91","v2024.93","v2024.94","v2024.95","v2024.96","v2025","v2025.2","v2025.3","v2025.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-2267-xqcf-gw2m/GHSA-2267-xqcf-gw2m.json"}},{"package":{"name":"facturascripts/facturascripts","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/facturascripts/facturascripts"},"versions":["2025.11"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-2267-xqcf-gw2m/GHSA-2267-xqcf-gw2m.json"}},{"package":{"name":"facturascripts/facturascripts","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/facturascripts/facturascripts"},"versions":["2025.41"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-2267-xqcf-gw2m/GHSA-2267-xqcf-gw2m.json"}},{"package":{"name":"facturascripts/facturascripts","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/facturascripts/facturascripts"},"versions":["2025.43"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-2267-xqcf-gw2m/GHSA-2267-xqcf-gw2m.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/NeoRazorX/facturascripts/security/advisories/GHSA-2267-xqcf-gw2m"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/NeoRazorX/facturascripts/commit/e908ade21c84bdc9d51190057482316730c66146"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/NeoRazorX/facturascripts"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-12-30T20:52:21Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
