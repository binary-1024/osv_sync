{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-24741","published":"2026-01-27T21:11:57.295Z","modified":"2026-01-30T22:49:37.731406Z","aliases":["GHSA-w372-w6cr-45jp"],"summary":"ConvertX Vulnerable to Arbitrary File Deletion via Path Traversal in `POST /delete`","details":"ConvertXis a self-hosted online file converter. In versions prior to 0.17.0, the `POST /delete` endpoint uses a user-controlled `filename` value to construct a filesystem path and deletes it via `unlink` without sufficient validation. By supplying path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`), an attacker can delete arbitrary files outside the intended uploads directory, limited only by the permissions of the server process. Version 0.17.0 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/c4illin/convertx","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6c812b44bb25bfaf00c7ad2c8a1b57a64e8bdc21"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.13.0","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24741.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/C4illin/ConvertX/commit/7a936bdc0463936463616381ca257b13babc5e77"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/C4illin/ConvertX/security/advisories/GHSA-w372-w6cr-45jp"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24741.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24741"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-22"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24741.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H"}]}
