  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxdp: use flags field to disambiguate broadcast redirect\n\nWhen redirecting a packet using XDP, the bpf_redirect_map() helper will set\nup the redirect destination information in struct bpf_redirect_info (using\nthe __bpf_xdp_redirect_map() helper function), and the xdp_do_redirect()\nfunction will read this information after the XDP program returns and pass\nthe frame on to the right redirect destination.\n\nWhen using the BPF_F_BROADCAST flag to do multicast redirect to a whole\nmap, __bpf_xdp_redirect_map() sets the 'map' pointer in struct\nbpf_redirect_info to point to the destination map to be broadcast. And\nxdp_do_redirect() reacts to the value of this map pointer to decide whether\nit's dealing with a broadcast or a single-value redirect. However, if the\ndestination map is being destroyed before xdp_do_redirect() is called, the\nmap pointer will be cleared out (by bpf_clear_redirect_map()) without\nwaiting for any XDP programs to stop running. This causes xdp_do_redirect()\nto think that the redirect was to a single target, but the target pointer\nis also NULL (since broadcast redirects don't have a single target), so\nthis causes a crash when a NULL pointer is passed to dev_map_enqueue().\n\nTo fix this, change xdp_do_redirect() to react directly to the presence of\nthe BPF_F_BROADCAST flag in the 'flags' value in struct bpf_redirect_info\nto disambiguate between a single-target and a broadcast redirect. And only\nread the 'map' pointer if the broadcast flag is set, aborting if that has\nbeen cleared out in the meantime. This prevents the crash, while keeping\nthe atomic (cmpxchg-based) clearing of the map pointer itself, and without\nadding any more checks in the non-broadcast fast path.",
