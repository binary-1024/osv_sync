The next execution in the loop will assign self->code_table[11].extends to c, which will give the value of 10. This will make the loop run infinitely. This bug can, for example, be triggered by calling this function with a GIF image with LZW compression that is crafted in a special way.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gdk-pixbuf","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gdk-pixbuf?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.40.0-r2"}]}],"versions":["2.22.0-r0","2.22.0-r1","2.22.0-r2","2.22.0-r3","2.22.1-r0","2.22.1-r1","2.22.1-r2","2.22.1-r3","2.24.0-r0","2.24.0-r1","2.24.0-r2","2.26.1-r0","2.26.1-r1","2.26.1-r2","2.26.4-r0","2.26.4-r1","2.26.5-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.2-r0","2.28.2-r1","2.30.0-r0","2.30.7-r0","2.31.5-r0","2.32.1-r0","2.32.2-r0","2.34.0-r0","2.34.0-r1","2.34.0-r2","2.36.0-r0","2.36.10-r0","2.36.11-r0","2.36.11-r1","2.36.11-r2","2.36.2-r0","2.36.5-r0","2.36.6-r0","2.36.6-r1","2.36.8-r0","2.38.1-r0","2.38.2-r0","2.40.0-r0","2.40.0-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-29385.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gdk-pixbuf","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gdk-pixbuf?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.40.0-r4"}]}],"versions":["2.22.0-r0","2.22.0-r1","2.22.0-r2","2.22.0-r3","2.22.1-r0","2.22.1-r1","2.22.1-r2","2.22.1-r3","2.24.0-r0","2.24.0-r1","2.24.0-r2","2.26.1-r0","2.26.1-r1","2.26.1-r2","2.26.4-r0","2.26.4-r1","2.26.5-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.2-r0","2.28.2-r1","2.30.0-r0","2.30.7-r0","2.31.5-r0","2.32.1-r0","2.32.2-r0","2.34.0-r0","2.34.0-r1","2.34.0-r2","2.36.0-r0","2.36.10-r0","2.36.11-r0","2.36.11-r1","2.36.11-r2","2.36.2-r0","2.36.5-r0","2.36.6-r0","2.36.6-r1","2.36.8-r0","2.38.1-r0","2.38.2-r0","2.40.0-r0","2.40.0-r1","2.40.0-r2","2.40.0-r3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-29385.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gdk-pixbuf","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gdk-pixbuf?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.42.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.22.0-r0","2.22.0-r1","2.22.0-r2","2.22.0-r3","2.22.1-r0","2.22.1-r1","2.22.1-r2","2.22.1-r3","2.24.0-r0","2.24.0-r1","2.24.0-r2","2.26.1-r0","2.26.1-r1","2.26.1-r2","2.26.4-r0","2.26.4-r1","2.26.5-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.2-r0","2.28.2-r1","2.30.0-r0","2.30.7-r0","2.31.5-r0","2.32.1-r0","2.32.2-r0","2.34.0-r0","2.34.0-r1","2.34.0-r2","2.36.0-r0","2.36.10-r0","2.36.11-r0","2.36.11-r1","2.36.11-r2","2.36.2-r0","2.36.5-r0","2.36.6-r0","2.36.6-r1","2.36.8-r0","2.38.1-r0","2.38.2-r0","2.40.0-r0","2.40.0-r1","2.40.0-r2","2.42.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-29385.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gdk-pixbuf","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gdk-pixbuf?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.42.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.22.0-r0","2.22.0-r1","2.22.0-r2","2.22.0-r3","2.22.1-r0","2.22.1-r1","2.22.1-r2","2.22.1-r3","2.24.0-r0","2.24.0-r1","2.24.0-r2","2.26.1-r0","2.26.1-r1","2.26.1-r2","2.26.4-r0","2.26.4-r1","2.26.5-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.2-r0","2.28.2-r1","2.30.0-r0","2.30.7-r0","2.31.5-r0","2.32.1-r0","2.32.2-r0","2.34.0-r0","2.34.0-r1","2.34.0-r2","2.36.0-r0","2.36.10-r0","2.36.11-r0","2.36.11-r1","2.36.11-r2","2.36.2-r0","2.36.5-r0","2.36.6-r0","2.36.6-r1","2.36.8-r0","2.38.1-r0","2.38.2-r0","2.40.0-r0","2.40.0-r1","2.40.0-r2","2.42.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-29385.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gdk-pixbuf","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gdk-pixbuf?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.42.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.22.0-r0","2.22.0-r1","2.22.0-r2","2.22.0-r3","2.22.1-r0","2.22.1-r1","2.22.1-r2","2.22.1-r3","2.24.0-r0","2.24.0-r1","2.24.0-r2","2.26.1-r0","2.26.1-r1","2.26.1-r2","2.26.4-r0","2.26.4-r1","2.26.5-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.2-r0","2.28.2-r1","2.30.0-r0","2.30.7-r0","2.31.5-r0","2.32.1-r0","2.32.2-r0","2.34.0-r0","2.34.0-r1","2.34.0-r2","2.36.0-r0","2.36.10-r0","2.36.11-r0","2.36.11-r1","2.36.11-r2","2.36.2-r0","2.36.5-r0","2.36.6-r0","2.36.6-r1","2.36.8-r0","2.38.1-r0","2.38.2-r0","2.40.0-r0","2.40.0-r1","2.40.0-r2","2.42.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-29385.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gdk-pixbuf","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/gdk-pixbuf?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.42.2-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.22.0-r0","2.22.0-r1","2.22.0-r2","2.22.0-r3","2.22.1-r0","2.22.1-r1","2.22.1-r2","2.22.1-r3","2.24.0-r0","2.24.0-r1","2.24.0-r2","2.26.1-r0","2.26.1-r1","2.26.1-r2","2.26.4-r0","2.26.4-r1","2.26.5-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.2-r0","2.28.2-r1","2.30.0-r0","2.30.7-r0","2.31.5-r0","2.32.1-r0","2.32.2-r0","2.34.0-r0","2.34.0-r1","2.34.0-r2","2.36.0-r0","2.36.10-r0","2.36.11-r0","2.36.11-r1","2.36.11-r2","2.36.2-r0","2.36.5-r0","2.36.6-r0","2.36.6-r1","2.36.8-r0","2.38.1-r0","2.38.2-r0","2.40.0-r0","2.40.0-r1","2.40.0-r2","2.42.0-r0"],
