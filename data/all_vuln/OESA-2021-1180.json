Views that allow the user to control the default (not found) value of the t and translate helpers could be susceptible to XSS attacks. When an HTML-unsafe string is passed as the default for a missing translation key named html or ending in _html, the default string is incorrectly marked as HTML-safe and not escaped. This is patched in versions 6.0.3.3 and 5.2.4.4. A workaround without upgrading is proposed in the source advisory.(CVE-2020-15169)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"rubygem-actionview","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/rubygem-actionview&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.2.4.4-1.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"noarch":["rubygem-actionview-5.2.4.4-1.oe1.noarch.rpm","rubygem-actionview-doc-5.2.4.4-1.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["rubygem-actionview-5.2.4.4-1.oe1.src.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1180.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1180"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15169"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
