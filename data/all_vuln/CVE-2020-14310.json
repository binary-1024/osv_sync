It expects a font name to be at max UINT32_MAX - 1 length in bytes but it doesn't verify it before proceed with buffer allocation to read the value from the font value. An attacker may leverage that by crafting a malicious font file which has a name with UINT32_MAX, leading to read_section_as_string() to an arithmetic overflow, zero-sized allocation and further heap-based buffer overflow.","references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-08/msg00016.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-08/msg00017.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-14310"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202104-05"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4432-1/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H"}]}
