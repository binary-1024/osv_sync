  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix state management in error path of log writing function  After commit a694291a6211 (\"nilfs2: separate wait function from nilfs_segctor_write\") was applied, the log writing function nilfs_segctor_do_construct() was able to issue I/O requests continuously even if user data blocks were split into multiple logs across segments, but two potential flaws were introduced in its error handling.  First, if nilfs_segctor_begin_construction() fails while creating the second or subsequent logs, the log writing function returns without calling nilfs_segctor_abort_construction(), so the writeback flag set on pages/folios will remain uncleared.  This causes page cache operations to hang waiting for the writeback flag.  For example, truncate_inode_pages_final(), which is called via nilfs_evict_inode() when an inode is evicted from memory, will hang.  Second, the NILFS_I_COLLECTED flag set on normal inodes remain uncleared.  As a result, if the next log write involves checkpoint creation, that's fine, but if a partial log write is performed that does not, inodes with NILFS_I_COLLECTED set are erroneously removed from the \"sc_dirty_files\" list, and their data and b-tree blocks may not be written to the device, corrupting the block mapping.  Fix these issues by uniformly calling nilfs_segctor_abort_construction() on failure of each step in the loop in nilfs_segctor_do_construct(), having it clean up logs and segment usages according to progress, and correcting the conditions for calling nilfs_redirty_inodes() to ensure that the NILFS_I_COLLECTED flag is cleared.",
