  "details": "Wireshark allows you to examine protocol data stored in files or as it is captured from wired or wireless (WiFi or Bluetooth) networks, USB devices, and many other sources.  It supports dozens of protocol capture file formats and understands more than a thousand protocols. It has many powerful features including a rich display filter language and the ability to reassemble multiple protocol packets in order to, for example, view a complete TCP stream, save the contents of a file which was transferred over HTTP or CIFS, or play back an RTP audio stream.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nXRA dissector infinite loop in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.5 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.13 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file(CVE-2023-2952)\n\nDue to failure in validating the length provided by an attacker-crafted MSMMS packet, Wireshark version 4.0.5 and prior, in an unusual configuration, is susceptible to a heap-based buffer overflow, and possibly code execution in the context of the process running Wireshark(CVE-2023-0667)",
