Mainly it wraps the OpenLDAP 2.x libs for that purpose.   Additionally the package contains modules for other LDAP-related stuff   (e.g. processing LDIF, LDAPURLs, LDAPv3 schema, LDAPv3 extended operations   and controls, etc.).\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\npython-ldap is a lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) client API for Python. In versions prior to 3.4.5, ldap.dn.escape_dn_chars() escapes \\x00 incorrectly by emitting a backslash followed by a literal NUL byte instead of the RFC-4514 hex form \\00. Any application that uses this helper to construct DNs from untrusted input can be made to consistently fail before a request is sent to the LDAP server (e.g., AD), resulting in a client-side denial of service. Version 3.4.5 contains a patch for the issue.(CVE-2025-61912)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-ldap","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python-ldap&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.4.4-3.oe2403sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python-ldap-debuginfo-3.4.4-3.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","python-ldap-debugsource-3.4.4-3.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","python3-ldap-3.4.4-3.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["python-ldap-help-3.4.4-3.oe2403sp1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["python-ldap-3.4.4-3.oe2403sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python-ldap-debuginfo-3.4.4-3.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","python-ldap-debugsource-3.4.4-3.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","python3-ldap-3.4.4-3.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2026-1248.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2026-1248"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61912"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
