This update provides the\ncorresponding updates for CVE-2025-68160 for openssl and openssl1.0,\nCVE-2025-69418 for openssl on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS,\nCVE-2025-69419 for openssl on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS,\nCVE-2025-69420 for openssl on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS,\nCVE-2025-69421 for openssl and openssl1.0, CVE-2026-22795 for openssl on\nUbuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, and CVE-2026-22796 for openssl and\nopenssl1.0.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Stanislav Fort, Petr Šimeček, and Hamza discovered that OpenSSL\n incorrectly validated PBMAC1 parameters when doing PKCS#12 MAC\n verification. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL\n to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected\n Ubuntu 25.10. (CVE-2025-11187)\n\n Stanislav Fort discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly parsed CMS\n AuthEnvelopedData messages. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\n cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2025-15467)\n\n Stanislav Fort discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the\n SSL_CIPHER_find() function. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\n cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only\n affected Ubuntu 25.10. (CVE-2025-15468)\n\n Stanislav Fort discovered that the OpenSSL \"openssl dgst\" command line\n tool incorrectly truncated data to 16MB. An attacker could posibly use\n this issue to hide unauthenticated data beyond the 16MB limit. This issue\n only affected Ubuntu 25.10. (CVE-2025-15469)\n\n Tomas Dulka and Stanislav Fort discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled\n memory with TLS 1.3 connections using certificate compression. An attacker\n could possibly use this issue to consume resources, leading to a denial of\n service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 25.10. (CVE-2025-66199)\n\n Petr Simecek and Stanislav Fort discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly\n handled memory when writing large data into a BIO chain. An attacker could\n possibly use this issue to consume resources, leading to a denial of\n service. (CVE-2025-68160)\n\n Stanislav Fort discovered that the OpenSSL OCB API could incorrectly leave\n final partial blocks unencrypted and unauthenticated. An attacker could\n possibly use this issue to read or tamper with the affected final bytes.\n (CVE-2025-69418)\n\n Stanislav Fort discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled the\n PKCS12_get_friendlyname() utf-8 conversion. An attacker could possibly use\n this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n (CVE-2025-69419)\n\n Luigino Camastra discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled ASN1_TYPE\n validation in the TS_RESP_verify_response() function. An attacker could\n possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial\n of service. (CVE-2025-69420)\n\n Luigino Camastra discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the\n PKCS12_item_decrypt_d2i_ex function. An attacker could possibly use this\n issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n (CVE-2025-69421)\n\n Luigino Camastra discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled ASN1_TYPE\n validation in PKCS#12 parsing. An attacker could possibly use this issue\n to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n (CVE-2026-22795)\n\n Luigino Camastra discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled ASN1_TYPE\n validation in the PKCS7_digest_from_attributes() function. An attacker\n could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a\n denial of service.
