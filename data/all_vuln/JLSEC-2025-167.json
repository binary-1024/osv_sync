If a string is already very large, combining it with more input can cause a hidden overflow in the size calculation. This makes the system think it has enough memory when it doesn’t. As a result, data may be written past the end of the allocated memory, leading to crashes or memory corruption.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"Glib_jll","ecosystem":"Julia","purl":"pkg:julia/Glib_jll?uuid=7746bdde-850d-59dc-9ae8-88ece973131d"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"2.76.5+0"},{"fixed":"2.86.0+0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/SecurityAdvisories.jl/tree/generated/osv/2025/JLSEC-2025-167.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-6052"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2372666"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC-BY-4.0","sources":[{"html_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-6052","id":"CVE-2025-6052","imported":"2025-10-19T21:13:26.140Z","modified":"2025-08-20T17:27:24.260Z","published":"2025-06-13T16:15:28.230Z","url":"https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2025-6052"}]}}
