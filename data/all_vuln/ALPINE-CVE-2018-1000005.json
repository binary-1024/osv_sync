{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2018-1000005","published":"2018-01-24T22:29:00.307Z","modified":"2025-11-19T06:12:11.551317Z","upstream":["CVE-2018-1000005"],"details":"libcurl 7.49.0 to and including 7.57.0 contains an out bounds read in code handling HTTP/2 trailers. It was reported (https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231) that reading an HTTP/2 trailer could mess up future trailers since the stored size was one byte less than required. The problem is that the code that creates HTTP/1-like headers from the HTTP/2 trailer data once appended a string like `:` to the target buffer, while this was recently changed to `: ` (a space was added after the colon) but the following math wasn't updated correspondingly. When accessed, the data is read out of bounds and causes either a crash or that the (too large) data gets passed to client write. This could lead to a denial-of-service situation or an information disclosure if someone has a service that echoes back or uses the trailers for something.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.4","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/curl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.58.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["7.19.2-r0","7.19.2-r1","7.19.4-r0","7.19.5-r0","7.19.6-r0","7.19.7-r0","7.19.7-r1","7.20.1-r0","7.20.1-r1","7.21.0-r0","7.21.1-r0","7.21.2-r0","7.21.3-r0","7.21.3-r1","7.21.4-r0","7.21.4-r1","7.21.5-r0","7.21.5-r1","7.21.6-r0","7.21.7-r0","7.21.7-r1","7.21.7-r2","7.22.0-r0","7.23.1-r0","7.24.0-r0","7.25.0-r0","7.26.0-r0","7.27.0-r0","7.27.0-r1","7.28.0-r0","7.28.1-r0","7.29.0-r0","7.30.0-r0","7.31.0-r0","7.32.0-r0","7.33.0-r0","7.33.0-r1","7.34.0-r0","7.34.0-r1","7.35.0-r0","7.36.0-r0","7.37.0-r0","7.37.1-r0","7.38.0-r0","7.39.0-r0","7.40.0-r0","7.41.0-r0","7.42.0-r0","7.42.1-r0","7.42.1-r1","7.43.0-r0","7.44.0-r0","7.45.0-r0","7.45.0-r1","7.46.0-r0","7.46.0-r1","7.46.0-r2","7.47.0-r0","7.47.1-r0","7.48.0-r0","7.49.0-r0","7.49.1-r0","7.50.1-r0","7.50.2-r0","7.50.3-r0","7.51.0-r0","7.52.1-r0","7.52.1-r1","7.52.1-r2","7.55.0-r0","7.55.0-r1","7.55.0-r2","7.57.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-1000005.json"}},{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.5","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/curl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.58.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["7.19.2-r0","7.19.2-r1","7.19.4-r0","7.19.5-r0","7.19.6-r0","7.19.7-r0","7.19.7-r1","7.20.1-r0","7.20.1-r1","7.21.0-r0","7.21.1-r0","7.21.2-r0","7.21.3-r0","7.21.3-r1","7.21.4-r0","7.21.4-r1","7.21.5-r0","7.21.5-r1","7.21.6-r0","7.21.7-r0","7.21.7-r1","7.21.7-r2","7.22.0-r0","7.23.1-r0","7.24.0-r0","7.25.0-r0","7.26.0-r0","7.27.0-r0","7.27.0-r1","7.28.0-r0","7.28.1-r0","7.29.0-r0","7.30.0-r0","7.31.0-r0","7.32.0-r0","7.33.0-r0","7.33.0-r1","7.34.0-r0","7.34.0-r1","7.35.0-r0","7.36.0-r0","7.37.0-r0","7.37.1-r0","7.38.0-r0","7.39.0-r0","7.40.0-r0","7.41.0-r0","7.42.0-r0","7.42.1-r0","7.42.1-r1","7.43.0-r0","7.44.0-r0","7.45.0-r0","7.45.0-r1","7.46.0-r0","7.46.0-r1","7.46.0-r2","7.47.0-r0","7.47.1-r0","7.48.0-r0","7.49.0-r0","7.49.1-r0","7.50.0-r0","7.50.1-r0","7.50.2-r0","7.50.3-r0","7.50.3-r1","7.51.0-r0","7.51.0-r1","7.52.0-r0","7.52.1-r0","7.52.1-r1","7.52.1-r2","7.52.1-r3","7.55.0-r0","7.56.0-r0","7.56.1-r0","7.57.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-1000005.json"}},{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.6","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/curl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.58.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["7.19.2-r0","7.19.2-r1","7.19.4-r0","7.19.5-r0","7.19.6-r0","7.19.7-r0","7.19.7-r1","7.20.1-r0","7.20.1-r1","7.21.0-r0","7.21.1-r0","7.21.2-r0","7.21.3-r0","7.21.3-r1","7.21.4-r0","7.21.4-r1","7.21.5-r0","7.21.5-r1","7.21.6-r0","7.21.7-r0","7.21.7-r1","7.21.7-r2","7.22.0-r0","7.23.1-r0","7.24.0-r0","7.25.0-r0","7.26.0-r0","7.27.0-r0","7.27.0-r1","7.28.0-r0","7.28.1-r0","7.29.0-r0","7.30.0-r0","7.31.0-r0","7.32.0-r0","7.33.0-r0","7.33.0-r1","7.34.0-r0","7.34.0-r1","7.35.0-r0","7.36.0-r0","7.37.0-r0","7.37.1-r0","7.38.0-r0","7.39.0-r0","7.40.0-r0","7.41.0-r0","7.42.0-r0","7.42.1-r0","7.42.1-r1","7.43.0-r0","7.44.0-r0","7.45.0-r0","7.45.0-r1","7.46.0-r0","7.46.0-r1","7.46.0-r2","7.47.0-r0","7.47.1-r0","7.48.0-r0","7.49.0-r0","7.49.1-r0","7.50.0-r0","7.50.1-r0","7.50.2-r0","7.50.3-r0","7.50.3-r1","7.51.0-r0","7.51.0-r1","7.52.0-r0","7.52.1-r0","7.52.1-r1","7.53.0-r0","7.53.1-r0","7.53.1-r1","7.53.1-r2","7.53.1-r3","7.54.0-r0","7.55.0-r0","7.56.0-r0","7.56.1-r0","7.57.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-1000005.json"}},{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.7","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/curl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.58.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["7.19.2-r0","7.19.2-r1","7.19.4-r0","7.19.5-r0","7.19.6-r0","7.19.7-r0","7.19.7-r1","7.20.1-r0","7.20.1-r1","7.21.0-r0","7.21.1-r0","7.21.2-r0","7.21.3-r0","7.21.3-r1","7.21.4-r0","7.21.4-r1","7.21.5-r0","7.21.5-r1","7.21.6-r0","7.21.7-r0","7.21.7-r1","7.21.7-r2","7.22.0-r0","7.23.1-r0","7.24.0-r0","7.25.0-r0","7.26.0-r0","7.27.0-r0","7.27.0-r1","7.28.0-r0","7.28.1-r0","7.29.0-r0","7.30.0-r0","7.31.0-r0","7.32.0-r0","7.33.0-r0","7.33.0-r1","7.34.0-r0","7.34.0-r1","7.35.0-r0","7.36.0-r0","7.37.0-r0","7.37.1-r0","7.38.0-r0","7.39.0-r0","7.40.0-r0","7.41.0-r0","7.42.0-r0","7.42.1-r0","7.42.1-r1","7.43.0-r0","7.44.0-r0","7.45.0-r0","7.45.0-r1","7.46.0-r0","7.46.0-r1","7.46.0-r2","7.47.0-r0","7.47.1-r0","7.48.0-r0","7.49.0-r0","7.49.1-r0","7.50.0-r0","7.50.1-r0","7.50.2-r0","7.50.3-r0","7.50.3-r1","7.51.0-r0","7.51.0-r1","7.52.0-r0","7.52.1-r0","7.52.1-r1","7.53.0-r0","7.53.1-r0","7.53.1-r1","7.53.1-r2","7.53.1-r3","7.54.0-r0","7.54.1-r0","7.55.0-r0","7.55.1-r0","7.56.0-r0","7.56.1-r0","7.56.1-r1","7.57.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https
