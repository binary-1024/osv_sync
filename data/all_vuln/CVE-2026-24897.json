In versions up to and including 0.2.14, an authenticated low-privileged user can upload arbitrary files to any specified location due to insufficient validation of user‑supplied paths when creating shares.\nBy specifying a writable path within the public web root, an attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code on the server, resulting in remote code execution (RCE). This vulnerability allows a low-privileged user to fully compromise the affected Erugo instance. Version 0.2.15 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/erugooss/erugo","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"256bc63831a0b5e9a94cb024a0724e0cd5fa5e38"}]}],"versions":["0.1.1","v0.0.001","v0.0.002","v0.0.003","v0.0.004","v0.0.005","v0.0.005-g","v0.0.005-n","v0.0.006","v0.0.006b","v0.0.007","v0.0.008","v0.0.009","v0.0.010","v0.0.011","v0.2.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24897.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24897.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ErugoOSS/Erugo/commit/256bc63831a0b5e9a94cb024a0724e0cd5fa5e38"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ErugoOSS/Erugo/releases/tag/v0.2.15"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ErugoOSS/Erugo/security/advisories/GHSA-336w-hgpq-6369"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24897"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-22","CWE-434","CWE-94"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24897.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
