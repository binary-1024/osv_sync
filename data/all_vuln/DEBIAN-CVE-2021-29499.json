The `siftool new` command and func siftool.New() produce predictable UUID identifiers due to insecure randomness in the version of the `github.com/satori/go.uuid` module used as a dependency. A patch is available in version >= v1.2.3 of the module. Users are encouraged to upgrade. As a workaround, users passing CreateInfo struct should ensure the `ID` field is generated using a version of `github.com/satori/go.uuid` that is not vulnerable to this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"golang-github-sylabs-sif","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-sylabs-sif?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.9-2.1","2.15.0-1","2.15.1-1","2.15.2-1","2.16.0-1","2.16.0-2","2.17.0-1","2.18.0-1","2.19.1-1","2.19.2-1","2.20.0-1","2.20.0-2","2.20.2-1","2.21.0-1","2.3.1-1","2.3.1-2","2.3.1-3","2.8.3-1","2.8.3-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-29499.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-sylabs-sif","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-sylabs-sif?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.3.1-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-29499.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-sylabs-sif","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-sylabs-sif?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.3.1-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-29499.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang-github-sylabs-sif","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/golang-github-sylabs-sif?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.3.1-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-29499.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-29499"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
