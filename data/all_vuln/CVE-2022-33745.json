To address XSA-401, code was moved inside a function in Xen. This code movement missed a variable changing meaning / value between old and new code positions. The now wrong use of the variable did lead to a wrong TLB flush condition, omitting flushes where such are necessary.","references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/07/26/2"},{"type":"FIX","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/07/26/3"},{"type":"FIX","url":"http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-408.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5272"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-408.txt"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HUFIMNGYP5VQAA6KE3T2I5GW6UP6F7BS/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MYI3OMJ7RIZNL3C6GUWNANNPEUUID6FM/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
