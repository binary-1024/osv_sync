  "details": "he updated packages fix security vulnerabilities and a packaging problem:\n\nAn out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in the way 389-ds-base handled\ncertain LDAP search filters, affecting all versions including 1.4.x. A\nremote, unauthenticated attacker could potentially use this flaw to make\nns-slapd crash via a specially crafted LDAP request, thus resulting in\ndenial of service. (CVE-2018-1054)\n\n389-ds-base before versions 1.3.8.5, 1.4.0.12 is vulnerable to a Cleartext\nStorage of Sensitive Information. By default, when the Replica and/or\nretroChangeLog plugins are enabled, 389-ds-base stores passwords in\nplaintext format in their respective changelog files. An attacker with\nsufficiently high privileges, such as root or Directory Manager, can\nquery these files in order to retrieve plaintext passwords.\n(CVE-2018-10871)\n\nIn 389-ds-base up to version 1.4.1.2, requests are handled by workers\nthreads. Each sockets will be waited by the worker for at most\n'ioblocktimeout' seconds. However this timeout applies only for un-\nencrypted requests. Connections using SSL/TLS are not taking this timeout\ninto account during reads, and may hang longer.An unauthenticated attacker\ncould repeatedly create hanging LDAP requests to hang all the workers,\nresulting in a Denial of Service. (CVE-2019-3883)\n\nA flaw was found in the 'deref' plugin of 389-ds-base where it could use\nthe 'search' permission to display attribute values. In some configurations,\nthis could allow an authenticated attacker to view private attributes, such\nas password hashes. (CVE-2019-14824)\n\nThere were conflicts between files from svrcore and 389-ds-base which\nprevented the installation of 389-ds (mga#25709)\n",
