The remedy is: upgrade to the patched 1.9.9 version.  A workaround is to temporarily switch to the h2o provider until DNSdist has been upgraded to a fixed version.  We would like to thank Charles Howes for bringing this issue to our attention.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"dnsdist","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dnsdist?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.9-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-30194.json"}},{"package":{"name":"dnsdist","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dnsdist?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.9-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-30194.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-30194"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
