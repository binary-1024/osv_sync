A remote attacker can trigger a crash and potentially achieve remote code execution depending on compiler options and runtime memory protections. Exploitation requires the proxy logic to be enabled (i.e., the proxy request handling code path in an application using libcoap).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libcoap3","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libcoap3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.3.1-1","4.3.1-2","4.3.3-1","4.3.4-1","4.3.4-1.1","4.3.4-1.1~exp1","4.3.5-1","4.3.5-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-34468.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libcoap3","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libcoap3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.3.4-1.1","4.3.4-1.1+deb13u1","4.3.4-1.1+deb13u2","4.3.5-1","4.3.5-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-34468.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libcoap3","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libcoap3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.3.4-1.1","4.3.5-1","4.3.5-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-34468.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-34468"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
