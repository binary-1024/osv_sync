Assimp aims to provide a full asset conversion pipeline for use in game engines and real-time rendering systems of any kind, but is not limited to this purpose.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA weakness has been identified in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 6.0.2. This affects the function Q3DImporter::InternReadFile of the file assimp/code/AssetLib/Q3D/Q3DLoader.cpp. Executing manipulation can lead to heap-based buffer overflow. The attack needs to be launched locally. The exploit has been made available to the public and could be exploited.(CVE-2025-11277)\n\nA vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. This issue affects the function Assimp::BaseImporter::ConvertToUTF8 of the file BaseImporter.cpp of the component File Handler. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.(CVE-2025-2152)\n\nA vulnerability classified as problematic was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. This vulnerability affects the function MDLImporter::InternReadFile_Quake1 of the file code/AssetLib/MDL/MDLLoader.cpp. The manipulation of the argument skinwidth/skinheight leads to divide by zero. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The patch is identified as ab66a1674fcfac87aaba4c8b900b315ebc3e7dbd. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.(CVE-2025-2591)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"assimp","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/assimp&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.3.1-11.oe2403sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["assimp-5.3.1-11.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","assimp-debuginfo-5.3.1-11.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","assimp-debugsource-5.3.1-11.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","assimp-devel-5.3.1-11.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["assimp-help-5.3.1-11.oe2403sp1.noarch.rpm","python3-assimp-5.3.1-11.oe2403sp1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["assimp-5.3.1-11.oe2403sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["assimp-5.3.1-11.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","assimp-debuginfo-5.3.1-11.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","assimp-debugsource-5.3.1-11.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","assimp-devel-5.3.1-11.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2026-1084.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2026-1084"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-11277"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-2152"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-2591"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Critical"}}
