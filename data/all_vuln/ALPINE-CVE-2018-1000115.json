This attack appear to be exploitable via network connectivity to port 11211 UDP. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 1.5.6 due to the disabling of the UDP protocol by default.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"memcached","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.4","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/memcached?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.33-r2"}]}],"versions":["1.4.10-r0","1.4.11-r0","1.4.13-r0","1.4.14-r0","1.4.15-r0","1.4.15-r1","1.4.15-r2","1.4.15-r3","1.4.15-r4","1.4.17-r0","1.4.18-r0","1.4.19-r0","1.4.20-r0","1.4.21-r0","1.4.21-r1","1.4.22-r0","1.4.22-r1","1.4.24-r0","1.4.25-r0","1.4.25-r1","1.4.25-r2","1.4.33-r0","1.4.33-r1","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.4.6-r0","1.4.7-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-1000115.json"}},{"package":{"name":"memcached","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.5","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/memcached?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.33-r2"}]}],"versions":["1.4.10-r0","1.4.11-r0","1.4.13-r0","1.4.14-r0","1.4.15-r0","1.4.15-r1","1.4.15-r2","1.4.15-r3","1.4.15-r4","1.4.17-r0","1.4.18-r0","1.4.19-r0","1.4.20-r0","1.4.21-r0","1.4.21-r1","1.4.22-r0","1.4.22-r1","1.4.24-r0","1.4.25-r0","1.4.25-r1","1.4.25-r2","1.4.31-r0","1.4.32-r0","1.4.33-r0","1.4.33-r1","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.4.6-r0","1.4.7-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-1000115.json"}},{"package":{"name":"memcached","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.6","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/memcached?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.36-r2"}]}],"versions":["1.4.10-r0","1.4.11-r0","1.4.13-r0","1.4.14-r0","1.4.15-r0","1.4.15-r1","1.4.15-r2","1.4.15-r3","1.4.15-r4","1.4.17-r0","1.4.18-r0","1.4.19-r0","1.4.20-r0","1.4.21-r0","1.4.21-r1","1.4.22-r0","1.4.22-r1","1.4.24-r0","1.4.25-r0","1.4.25-r1","1.4.25-r2","1.4.31-r0","1.4.32-r0","1.4.33-r0","1.4.34-r0","1.4.34-r1","1.4.35-r0","1.4.36-r0","1.4.36-r1","1.4.5-r0","1.4.5-r1","1.4.6-r0","1.4.7-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2018-1000115.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2018-1000115"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
