  "details": "CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files. CMake generates native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice. CMake is quite sophisticated: it is possible to support complex environments requiring system configuration, preprocessor generation, code generation, and template instantiation.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability was identified in cmake version 4.1.20250725-gb5cce23, affecting the cmForEachFunctionBlocker::ReplayItems function in the cmForEachCommand.cxx file. This vulnerability can lead to a reachable assertion error and requires local access to exploit. The exploit details have been publicly disclosed and may be utilized. It is recommended to apply patch 37e27f71bc356d880c908040cd0cb68fa2c371b8 to mitigate this issue.(CVE-2025-9301)",
