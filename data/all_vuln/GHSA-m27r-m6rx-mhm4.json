Reverb previously passed data from the Redis channel directly into PHP’s `unserialize()` function without restricting which classes could be instantiated.\n\n**Risk:** Remote Code Execution (RCE)\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability is fixed in Laravel Reverb v1.7.0.\n\nUpdate your dependency to `laravel/reverb: ^1.7.0` immediately.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you cannot upgrade to v1.7.0, you should apply the following mitigations:\n\n* Redis Security: Require a strong password for Redis access and ensure the service is only accessible via a private network or local loopback.\n* Disable Scaling: If your environment uses only one Reverb node, set `REVERB_SCALING_ENABLED=false` to bypass the vulnerable logic entirely.\n\n### Credits\nThis vulnerability was discovered and responsibly reported by Mohammad Yaser Abo-Elmaaty @m0h4mmad","affected":[{"package":{"name":"laravel/reverb","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/laravel/reverb"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.7.0"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.0-beta1","v1.0.0-beta10","v1.0.0-beta11","v1.0.0-beta12","v1.0.0-beta13","v1.0.0-beta14","v1.0.0-beta2","v1.0.0-beta3","v1.0.0-beta4","v1.0.0-beta5","v1.0.0-beta6","v1.0.0-beta7","v1.0.0-beta8","v1.0.0-beta9","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.4.6","v1.4.7","v1.4.8","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-m27r-m6rx-mhm4/GHSA-m27r-m6rx-mhm4.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/laravel/reverb/security/advisories/GHSA-m27r-m6rx-mhm4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23524"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/laravel/reverb/commit/9ec26f8ffbb701f84920dd0bb9781a1797591f1a"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/laravel/reverb"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/laravel/reverb/releases/tag/v1.7.0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/reverb#scaling"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://laravel.com/docs/reverb#scaling"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-502"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-21T15:40:24Z","nvd_published_at":"2026-01-21T22:15:50Z","severity":"CRITICAL"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
