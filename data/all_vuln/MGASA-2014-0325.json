  "details": "A flaw in OBJ_obj2txt may cause pretty printing functions such as\nX509_name_oneline, X509_name_print_ex et al. to leak some information from\nthe stack. Applications may be affected if they echo pretty printing output\nto the attacker. OpenSSL SSL/TLS clients and servers themselves are not\naffected (CVE-2014-3508).\n\nThe issue affects OpenSSL clients and allows a malicious server to crash\nthe client with a null pointer dereference (read) by specifying an SRP\nciphersuite even though it was not properly negotiated with the client. This\ncan be exploited through a Denial of Service attack (CVE-2014-5139).\n\nIf a multithreaded client connects to a malicious server using a resumed\nsession and the server sends an ec point format extension it could write up\nto 255 bytes to freed memory (CVE-2014-3509).\n\nAn attacker can force an error condition which causes openssl to crash\nwhilst processing DTLS packets due to memory being freed twice. This can be\nexploited through a Denial of Service attack (CVE-2014-3505).\n\nAn attacker can force openssl to consume large amounts of memory whilst\nprocessing DTLS handshake messages. This can be exploited through a Denial\nof Service attack (CVE-2014-3506).\n\nBy sending carefully crafted DTLS packets an attacker could cause openssl to\nleak memory. This can be exploited through a Denial of Service attack\n(CVE-2014-3507).\n\nOpenSSL DTLS clients enabling anonymous (EC)DH ciphersuites are subject to a\ndenial of service attack. A malicious server can crash the client with a\nnull pointer dereference (read) by specifying an anonymous (EC)DH\nciphersuite and sending carefully crafted handshake messages\n(CVE-2014-3510).\n\nA flaw in the OpenSSL SSL/TLS server code causes the server to negotiate\nTLS 1.0 instead of higher protocol versions when the ClientHello message is\nbadly fragmented. This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to force a\ndowngrade to TLS 1.0 even if both the server and the client support a higher\nprotocol version, by modifying the client's TLS records (CVE-2014-3511).\n\nA malicious client or server can send invalid SRP parameters and overrun\nan internal buffer. Only applications which are explicitly set up for SRP\nuse are affected (CVE-2014-3512).\n",
