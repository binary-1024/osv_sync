  "details": "# tls-extra: certificate validation does not check Basic Constraints\n\n*tls-extra* does not check the Basic Constraints extension of a\ncertificate in certificate chain processing.  Any certificate is\ntreated as a CA certificate.  As a consequence, anyone who has a\nvalid certificate can use it to sign another one (with an arbitrary\nsubject DN/domain name embedded into it) and have it accepted by\n*tls*.  This allows MITM attacks on TLS connections.\n",
