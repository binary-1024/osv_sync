It makes your database the primary location for other systems to use for authentication in a SSO environment.\n\nThe module doesn't sufficiently sanitize user-supplied field values configured to be included as attributes in a CAS server response.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must be authenticated, have the ability to enter XML into a user entity field, and that field be configured as a CAS Attribute source leading to an XML Element Injection vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"drupal/cas_server","ecosystem":"Packagist:https://packages.drupal.org/8","purl":"pkg:composer/drupal/cas_server"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.0.3"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":"<2.0.3"}},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.1.0"},{"fixed":"2.1.2"}],"database_specific":{"constraint":">=2.1.0 <2.1.2"}}],"database_specific":{"affected_versions":"<2.0.3 || >=2.1.0 <2.1.2","source":"https://github.com/DrupalSecurityTeam/drupal-advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/cas_server/DRUPAL-CONTRIB-2026-007.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2026-007"}],"credits":[{"name":"Gaël Gosset (gaëlg)","contact":["https://www.drupal.org/u/ga%C3%ABlg"]}]}
