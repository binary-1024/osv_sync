This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation (bnc#1192045).\n- CVE-2021-20322: Make the ipv4 and ipv6 ICMP exception caches less predictive to avoid information leaks about UDP ports in use. (bsc#1191790)\n- CVE-2021-0935: In ip6_xmit of ip6_output.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a use after free. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. (bsc#1192032)\n",
