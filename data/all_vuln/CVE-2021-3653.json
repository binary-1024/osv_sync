The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the \"int_ctl\" field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.14-rc7.","references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165477/Kernel-Live-Patch-Security-Notice-LSN-0083-1.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1983686"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/10/msg00010.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/12/msg00012.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/08/16/1"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
