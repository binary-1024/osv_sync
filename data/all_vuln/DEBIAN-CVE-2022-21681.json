Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression `inline.reflinkSearch` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a denial of service (DoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"node-marked","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-marked?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.8.0+ds+repack-2","0.8.0+ds+repack-3","4.0.12+ds+~4.0.1-1","4.0.12+ds+~4.0.1-2","4.0.16+ds+~4.0.3-1","4.0.17+ds+~4.0.3-1","4.0.18+ds+~4.0.5-1","4.0.5+ds-1","4.0.5+ds-2","4.0.5+ds-3","4.0.5+ds-4","4.0.5+ds-5","4.0.9+ds+~4.0.1-1","4.0.9+ds+~4.0.1-2","4.1.0+ds+~4.0.6-1","4.1.0+ds+~4.0.6-2","4.2.2+ds+~4.0.7-1","4.2.3+ds+~4.0.7-1","4.2.3+ds+~4.0.7-2","4.2.3+ds+~4.0.7-3","4.2.3+ds+~4.0.7-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-21681.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-marked","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-marked?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.12+ds+~4.0.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-21681.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-marked","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-marked?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.12+ds+~4.0.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-21681.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-marked","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-marked?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.12+ds+~4.0.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-21681.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-21681"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
