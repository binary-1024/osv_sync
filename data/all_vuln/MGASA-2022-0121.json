  "summary": "Updated kernel packages fix security vulnerabilities",
  "details": "This kernel update is based on upstream 5.15.32 and fixes at least the\nfollowing security issues:\n\nAn out-of-bounds (OOB) memory write flaw was found in the Linux kernel\u2019s\nwatch_queue event notification subsystem. This flaw can overwrite parts\nof the kernel state, potentially allowing a local user to gain privileged\naccess or cause a denial of service on the system (CVE-2022-0995).\n\nA flaw use after free in the Linux kernel FUSE filesystem was found in\nthe way user triggers write(). A local user could use this flaw to get\nsome unauthorized access to some data from the FUSE filesystem and as\nresult potentially privilege escalation too (CVE-2022-1011).\n\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel in linux/net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c\nof the netfilter subsystem. This flaw allows a local user to cause an\nout-of-bounds write issue (CVE-2022-1015).\n\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel in net/netfilter/nf_tables_core.c:\nnft_do_chain, which can cause a use-after-free. This issue needs to handle\n'return' with proper preconditions, as it can lead to a kernel information\nleak problem caused by a local, unprivileged attacker (CVE-2022-1016).\n\nA use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel\u2019s sound subsystem in\nthe way a user triggers concurrent calls of PCM hw_params. The hw_free\nioctls or similar race condition happens inside ALSA PCM for other ioctls.\nThis flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their\nprivileges on the system (CVE-2022-1048).\n\nst21nfca_connectivity_event_received in drivers/nfc/st21nfca/se.c has\nEVT_TRANSACTION buffer overflows because of untrusted length parameters\n(CVE-2022-26490).\n\nThere is a buffer overflow in ESP transformation in net/ipv4/esp4.c and\nnet/ipv6/esp6.c via a large message. In some configurations, local users\ncan gain privileges by overwriting kernel heap objects (CVE-2022-27666).\n\nA refcount leak bug was found in net/llc/af_llc.c (CVE-2022-28356).\n\nOther fixes in this update:\n- locking/lockdep: Avoid potential access of invalid memory in lock_class\n- mm: kfence: fix missing objcg housekeeping for SLAB\n- net: ipv6: fix skb_over_panic in __ip6_append_data\n- rtw88: Add support for Realtek 8821CE RFE Type 6\n- revert: \"swiotlb: rework 'fix info leak with DMA_FROM_DEVICE'\" as it\n  breaks atleast ath9k\n\nFor other upstream fixes, see the referenced changelogs.\n",
