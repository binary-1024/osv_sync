When the kubeconfig file does not configure custom CA to verify certs, kubeclient ends up accepting any certificate (it wrongly returns VERIFY_NONE). Ruby applications that leverage kubeclient to parse kubeconfig files are susceptible to Man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ruby-kubeclient","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ruby-kubeclient?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.11.0-1","4.11.0-2","4.12.0-1","4.9.1-2","4.9.2-1","4.9.2-1~bpo11+2","4.9.2-2","4.9.3-1","4.9.3-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-0759.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ruby-kubeclient","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ruby-kubeclient?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.9.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-0759.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ruby-kubeclient","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ruby-kubeclient?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.9.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-0759.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ruby-kubeclient","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ruby-kubeclient?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.9.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-0759.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0759"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
