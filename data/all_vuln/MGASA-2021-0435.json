This\ncopy is most used on Windows and macOS.\n\nbpo-43124: Made the internal putcmd function in smtplib sanitize input for\npresence of \\r and \\n characters to avoid (unlikely) command injection.\n\nbpo-36384: ipaddress module no longer accepts any leading zeros in IPv4\naddress strings. Leading zeros are ambiguous and interpreted as octal\nnotation by some libraries. For example the legacy function\nsocket.inet_aton() treats leading zeros as octal notation. glibc\nimplementation of modern inet_pton() does not accept any leading zeros.\nFor a while the ipaddress module used to accept ambiguous leading zeros.\n\nIt was discovered that Python incorrectly handled certain RFCs.\nAn attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\nThis issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 ESM. (CVE-2021-3733)\n\nIt was discovered that Python incorrectly handled certain\nserver responses. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\ncause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3737)\n",
