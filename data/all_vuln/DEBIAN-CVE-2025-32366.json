Consequently, *rdlen may be larger than the amount of remaining packet data in the current state of parsing. Values of stack memory locations may be sent over the network in a response.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"connman","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/connman?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.36-2.2","1.36-2.2+deb11u1","1.36-2.2+deb11u2","1.36-2.3","1.36-2.4","1.37+repack-1","1.41-1","1.41-2","1.41-3","1.42-1","1.42-2","1.42-3","1.42-4","1.42-5","1.43-1","1.44-1","1.44-2","1.44-3","1.45-1","1.45-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-32366.json"}},{"package":{"name":"connman","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/connman?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.41-3","1.42-1","1.42-2","1.42-3","1.42-4","1.42-5","1.43-1","1.44-1","1.44-2","1.44-3","1.45-1","1.45-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-32366.json"}},{"package":{"name":"connman","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/connman?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.44-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-32366.json"}},{"package":{"name":"connman","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/connman?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.44-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-32366.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-32366"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L"}]}
