We should use RB_CLEAR_NODE() set the erased node to EMPTY, then pde_subdir_next() will return NULL to avoid uaf access.  We found an uaf issue while using stress-ng testing, need to run testcase getdent and tun in the same time.  The steps of the issue is as follows:  1) use getdent to traverse dir /proc/pid/net/dev_snmp6/, and current    pde is tun3;  2) in the [time windows] unregister netdevice tun3 and tun2, and erase    them from rbtree.  erase tun3 first, and then erase tun2.  the    pde(tun2) will be released to slab;  3) continue to getdent process, then pde_subdir_next() will return    pde(tun2) which is released, it will case uaf access.
