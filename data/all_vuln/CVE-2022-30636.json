{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-30636","published":"2024-07-02T20:15:05Z","modified":"2025-08-09T19:01:27Z","aliases":["GO-2024-2961"],"details":"httpTokenCacheKey uses path.Base to extract the expected HTTP-01 token value to lookup in the DirCache implementation. On Windows, path.Base acts differently to filepath.Base, since Windows uses a different path separator (\\ vs. /), allowing a user to provide a relative path, i.e. .well-known/acme-challenge/..\\..\\asd becomes ..\\..\\asd. The extracted path is then suffixed with +http-01, joined with the cache directory, and opened. Since the controlled path is suffixed with +http-01 before opening, the impact of this is significantly limited, since it only allows reading arbitrary files on the system if and only if they have this suffix.","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://go.dev/cl/408694"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://go.dev/issue/53082"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2961"}]}
