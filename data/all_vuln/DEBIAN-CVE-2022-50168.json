{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-50168","published":"2025-06-18T11:15:47Z","modified":"2025-09-25T03:22:52.214717Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-50168"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf, x86: fix freeing of not-finalized bpf_prog_pack  syzbot reported a few issues with bpf_prog_pack [1], [2]. This only happens with multiple subprogs. In jit_subprogs(), we first call bpf_int_jit_compile() on each sub program. And then, we call it on each sub program again. jit_data is not freed in the first call of bpf_int_jit_compile(). Similarly we don't call bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() in the first call of bpf_int_jit_compile().  If bpf_int_jit_compile() failed for one sub program, we will call bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() for this sub program. However, we don't have a chance to call it for other sub programs. Then we will hit \"goto out_free\" in jit_subprogs(), and call bpf_jit_free on some subprograms that haven't got bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() yet.  At this point, bpf_jit_binary_pack_free() is called and the whole 2MB page is freed erroneously.  Fix this with a custom bpf_jit_free() for x86_64, which calls bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() if necessary. Also, with custom bpf_jit_free(), bpf_prog_aux->use_bpf_prog_pack is not needed any more, remove it.
