{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-23622","published":"2026-01-15T19:28:58.369Z","modified":"2026-01-16T02:47:27.194081Z","aliases":["GHSA-54v4-4685-vwrj"],"summary":"CSRF Protection Bypass: Sensitive endpoints accept GET requests, enabling admin account takeover","details":"Easy!Appointments is a self hosted appointment scheduler. In 1.5.2 and earlier, application/core/EA_Security.php::csrf_verify() only enforces CSRF for POST requests and returns early for non-POST methods. Several application endpoints perform state-changing operations while accepting parameters from GET (or $_REQUEST), so an attacker can perform CSRF by forcing a victim's browser to issue a crafted GET request. Impact: creation of admin accounts, modification of admin email/password, and full admin account takeover.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/alextselegidis/easyappointments","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"48d32686b0f40fc782c2bdf1bde4baafa4dbeea4"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1.5.2"}]}}],"versions":["1.1.0","1.1.0-beta.1","1.1.0-beta.2","1.1.1","1.2.0","1.2.0-alpha.1","1.2.0-beta.1","1.2.1","1.3.0","1.3.0-alpha.1","1.3.0-beta.1","1.3.0-beta.2","1.3.1","1.3.1-beta.1","1.3.2","1.3.2-beta.1","1.4.0","1.4.0-beta.1","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.4.2-beta.1","1.4.3","1.4.3-beta.1","1.5.0","1.5.0-alpha.1","1.5.0-beta.1","1.5.0-dev.1","1.5.0-dev.2","1.5.0-dev.3","1.5.0-dev.4","1.5.1","1.5.1-beta.1","1.5.2","1.5.2-beta.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23622.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23622.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/alextselegidis/easyappointments/security/advisories/GHSA-54v4-4685-vwrj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23622"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-352"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23622.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
