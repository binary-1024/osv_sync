This issue makes the RSA implementation with 2048 bit private keys incorrect on such machines and memory corruption will happen during the computation. As a consequence of the memory corruption an attacker may be able to trigger a remote code execution on the machine performing the computation. SSL/TLS servers or other servers using 2048 bit RSA private keys running on machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86_64 architecture are affected by this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"openssl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/openssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-2274.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openssl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/openssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-2274.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openssl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/openssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-2274.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openssl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/openssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-2274.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openssl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/openssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-2274.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openssl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/openssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-2274.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2022-2274"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
