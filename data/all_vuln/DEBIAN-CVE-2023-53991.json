To prevent this from happening, where null-pointer dereferences typically result in a hard-to-debug platform lockup, num_blks shouldn't increase past NULL blocks and will print an error and break instead. After all, max_blks represents the static size of the maximum number of blocks whereas the actual amount varies per platform.  ^1: which can happen after a git rebase ended up moving additions to _dpu_cfg to a different struct which has the same patch context.
