{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68793","published":"2026-01-13T16:16:01.197Z","modified":"2026-01-14T11:11:00.620710Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-68793"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amdgpu: fix a job->pasid access race in gpu recovery  Avoid a possible UAF in GPU recovery due to a race between the sched timeout callback and the tdr work queue.  The gpu recovery function calls drm_sched_stop() and later drm_sched_start().  drm_sched_start() restarts the tdr queue which will eventually free the job.  If the tdr queue frees the job before time out callback completes, the job will be freed and we'll get a UAF when accessing the pasid.  Cache it early to avoid the UAF.
