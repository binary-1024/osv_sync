Prior to 3.6.2, an Open Redirect vulnerability was identified in the /WeGIA/controle/control.php endpoint of the WeGIA application, specifically through the nextPage parameter when combined with metodo=listarTodos and nomeClasse=ProdutoControle. The application fails to validate or restrict the nextPage parameter, allowing attackers to redirect users to arbitrary external websites. This can be abused for phishing attacks, credential theft, malware distribution, and social engineering using the trusted WeGIA domain. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.6.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/labredescefetrj/wegia","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"650e84448985b3fb44276b6def5544bd9478ee45"}]}],"versions":["0.9.4-beta","3.3.0","3.3.1","3.3.2","3.3.3","3.4.0","3.4.1","3.4.10","3.4.11","3.4.12","3.4.2","3.4.3","3.4.4","3.4.5","3.4.6","3.4.7","3.4.8","3.4.9","3.5.0","3.5.1","3.5.2","3.5.3","3.5.4","3.5.5","3.6.0","3.6.1","v1.0","v2.0","v2.0-beta","v3.0","v3.1","v3.2.0","v3.2.10","v3.2.11","v3.2.12","v3.2.13","v3.2.14","v3.2.15","v3.2.16","v3.2.17","v3.2.6","v3.2.7","v3.2.8","v3.2.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23730.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23730.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/LabRedesCefetRJ/WeGIA/pull/1333"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/LabRedesCefetRJ/WeGIA/releases/tag/3.6.2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/LabRedesCefetRJ/WeGIA/security/advisories/GHSA-6gx4-6gwv-cxc3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23730"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-601"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23730.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:A/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N"}]}
