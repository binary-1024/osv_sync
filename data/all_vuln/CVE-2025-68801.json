A reference is only\ntaken when the neighbour is used by a nexthop.\n\nFix by simplifying the reference counting scheme. Always take a\nreference when storing a neighbour pointer in a neighbour entry. Avoid\ntaking a referencing when the neighbour is used by a nexthop as the\nneighbour entry associated with the nexthop already holds a reference.\n\nTested by running the test that uncovered the problem over 300 times.\nWithout this patch the problem was reproduced after a handful of\niterations.\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in mlxsw_sp_neigh_entry_update+0x2d4/0x310\nRead of size
