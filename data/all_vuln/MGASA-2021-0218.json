  "details": "An infinite loop in SMLLexer in Pygments versions 1.5 to 2.7.3 may lead to denial of service when performing syntax highlighting of a Standard ML (SML) source file, as demonstrated by input that only contains the \"exception\" keyword (CVE-2021-20270).\n\nA deadlock vulnerability was found in 'github.com/containers/storage' in versions before 1.28.1. When a container image is processed, each layer is unpacked using `tar`. If one of those layers is not a valid `tar` archive this causes an error leading to an unexpected situation where the code indefinitely waits for the tar unpacked stream, which never finishes. An attacker could use this vulnerability to craft a malicious image, which when downloaded and stored by an application using containers/storage, would then cause a deadlock leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) (CVE-2021-27291).\n\nAn issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.31.13 and 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.2. When using the MediaWiki API to \"protect\" a page, a user is currently able to protect to a higher level than they currently have permissions for (CVE-2021-30152).\n\nAn issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.31.12 and 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.2. ContentModelChange does not check if a user has correct permissions to create and set the content model of a nonexistent page (CVE-2021-30155).\n\nAn issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.31.12 and 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.2. Blocked users are unable to use Special:ResetTokens. This has security relevance because a blocked user might have accidentally shared a token, or might know that a token has been compromised, and yet is not able to block any potential future use of the token by an unauthorized party\n(CVE-2021-30158).\n\nAn issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.31.12 and 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.2. Users can bypass intended restrictions on deleting pages in certain \"fast double move\" situations. MovePage::isValidMoveTarget() uses FOR UPDATE, but it's only called if Title::getArticleID() returns non-zero with no special flags. Next, MovePage::moveToInternal() will delete the page if getArticleID(READ_LATEST) is non-zero. Therefore, if the page is missing in the replica DB, isValidMove() will return true, and then moveToInternal() will unconditionally delete the page if it can be found in the master (CVE-2021-30159).\n",
