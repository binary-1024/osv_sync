  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/i8259: Mark legacy PIC interrupts with IRQ_LEVEL\n\nBaoquan reported that after triggering a crash the subsequent crash-kernel\nfails to boot about half of the time. It triggers a NULL pointer\ndereference in the periodic tick code.\n\nThis happens because the legacy timer interrupt (IRQ0) is resent in\nsoftware which happens in soft interrupt (tasklet) context. In this context\nget_irq_regs() returns NULL which leads to the NULL pointer dereference.\n\nThe reason for the resend is a spurious APIC interrupt on the IRQ0 vector\nwhich is captured and leads to a resend when the legacy timer interrupt is\nenabled. This is wrong because the legacy PIC interrupts are level\ntriggered and therefore should never be resent in software, but nothing\never sets the IRQ_LEVEL flag on those interrupts, so the core code does not\nknow about their trigger type.\n\nEnsure that IRQ_LEVEL is set when the legacy PCI interrupts are set up.",
