This can lead to confusion, including the bug\nidentified by syzbot (two descriptors with matching endpoint numbers\nand directions, where one was interrupt and the other was bulk).\r\n\r\nTo fix the bug, we will clear the reserved bits in bEndpointAddress\nwhen we parse the descriptor.

Firstly, the removed (u64) cast\nfrom the multiplication will introduce a multiplication overflow on 32-bit\narchs if wb_thresh * bg_thresh &gt;= 1&lt;&lt;32 (which is actually common - the\ndefault settings with 4GB of RAM will trigger this).  Secondly, the\ndiv64_u64() is unnecessarily expensive on 32-bit archs.  We have\ndiv64_ul() in case we want to be safe &amp; cheap.  Thirdly, if dirty\nthresholds are larger than 1&lt;&lt;32 pages, then dirty balancing is going to\nblow up in many other spectacular ways anyway so trying to fix one\npossible overflow is just moot.(CVE-2024-42102)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nnilfs2: fix inode number range checks\r\n\r\nPatch series &quot;nilfs2: fix potential issues related to reserved inodes&quot;.\r\n\r\nThis series fixes one use-after-free issue reported by syzbot, caused by\nnilfs2&apos;s internal inode being exposed in the namespace on a corrupted\nfilesystem, and a couple of flaws that cause problems if the starting\nnumber of non-reserved inodes written in the on-disk super block is\nintentionally (or corruptly) changed from its default value.  \r\n\r\n\nThis patch (of 3):\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation of nilfs2, &quot;nilfs-&gt;ns_first_ino&quot;, which\ngives the first non-reserved inode number, is read from the superblock,\nbut its lower limit is not checked.\r\n\r\nAs a result, if a number that overlaps with the inode number range of\nreserved inodes such as the root directory or metadata files is set in the\nsuper block parameter, the inode number test macros (NILFS_MDT_INODE and\nNILFS_VALID_INODE) will not function properly.\r\n\r\nIn addition, these test macros use left bit-shift calculations using with\nthe inode number as the shift count via the BIT macro, but the result of a\nshift calculation that exceeds the bit width of an integer is undefined in\nthe C specification, so if &quot;ns_first_ino&quot; is set to a large value other\nthan the default value NILFS_USER_INO (=11), the macros may potentially\nmalfunction depending on the environment.\r\n\r\nFix these issues by checking the lower bound of &quot;nilfs-&gt;ns_first_ino&quot; and\nby preventing bit shifts equal to or greater than the NILFS_USER_INO\nconstant in the inode number test macros.\r\n\r\nAlso, change the type of &quot;ns_first_ino&quot; from signed integer to unsigned\ninteger to avoid the need for type casting in comparisons such as the\nlower bound check introduced this time.(CVE-2024-42105)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\norangefs: fix out-of-bounds fsid access\r\n\r\nArnd Bergmann sent a patch to fsdevel, he says:\r\n\r\n&quot;orangefs_statfs() copies two consecutive fields of the superblock into\nthe statfs structure, which triggers a warning from the string fortification\nhelpers&quot;\r\n\r\nJan Kara suggested an alternate way to do the patch to make it more readable.\r\n\r\nI ran both ideas through xfstests and both seem fine.

Below is the part of this explanation that it important\nfor this patch\r\n\r\n/*\n  * The total number of L2 queues, MSIX vectors and HW contexts (CIDs) is\n  * control by the number of fast-path status blocks supported by the\n  * device (HW/FW). Each fast-path status block (FP-SB) aka non-default\n  * status block represents an independent interrupts context that can\n  * serve a regular L2 networking queue. However special L2 queues such\n  * as the FCoE queue do not require a FP-SB and other components like\n  * the CNIC may consume FP-SB reducing the number of possible L2 queues\n  *\n  * If the maximum number of FP-SB available is X then:\n  * a. If CNIC is supported it consumes 1 FP-SB thus the max number of\n  *    regular L2 queues is Y=X-1\n  * b. In MF mode the actual number of L2 queues is Y= (X-1/MF_factor)\n  * c. If the FCoE L2 queue is supported the actual number of L2 queues\n  *    is Y+1\n  * d. The number of irqs (MSIX vectors) is either Y+1 (one extra for\n  *    slow-path interrupts) or Y+2 if CNIC is supported (one additional\n  *    FP interrupt context for the CNIC).\n  * e. The number of HW context (CID count) is always X or X+1 if FCoE\n  *    L2 queue is supported. The cid for the FCoE L2 queue is always X.\n  */\r\n\r\nHowever this driver also supports NICs that use the E2 controller which can\nhandle more queues due to having more FP-SB represented by FP_SB_MAX_E2.\nLooking at the commits when the E2 support was added, it was originally\nusing the E1x parameters: commit f2e0899f0f27 (&quot;bnx2x: Add 57712 support&quot;).\nBack then FP_SB_MAX_E2 was set to 16 the same as E1x. However the driver\nwas later updated to take full advantage of the E2 instead of having it be\nlimited to the capabilities of the E1x. But as far as we can tell, the\narray &quot;stats_query_entry query&quot; was still limited to using the FP-SB\navailable to the E1x cards as part of an oversignt when the driver was\nupdated to take full advantage of the E2, and now with the driver being\naware of the greater queue size supported by E2 NICs, it causes the UBSAN\nwarnings seen in the stack traces below.\r\n\r\nThis patch increases the size of the &quot;stats_query_entry query&quot; array by\nreplacing FP_SB_MAX_E1x with FP_SB_MAX_E2 to be large enough to handle\nboth types of NICs.\r\n\r\nStack traces:\r\n\r\nUBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in\n       drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/bnx2x_stats.c:1529:11\nindex 20 is out of range for type &apos;stats_query_entry [19]&apos;\nCPU: 12 PID: 858 Comm: systemd-network Not tainted 6.9.0-060900rc7-generic\n\t     #202405052133\nHardware name: HP ProLiant DL360 Gen9/ProLiant DL360 \n---truncated---(CVE-2024-42148)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\ntcp_metrics: validate source addr length\r\n\r\nI don&apos;t see anything checking that TCP_METRICS_ATTR_SADDR_IPV4\nis at least 4 bytes long, and the policy doesn&apos;t have an entry\nfor this attribute at all (neither does it for IPv6 but v6 is\nmanually validated).(CVE-2024-42154)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\ns390/pkey: Wipe sensitive data on failure\r\n\r\nWipe sensitive data from stack also if the copy_to_user() fails.(CVE-2024-42157)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nf2fs: check validation of fault attrs in f2fs_build_fault_attr()\r\n\r\n- It missed to check validation of fault attrs in parse_options(),\nlet&apos;s fix to add check condition in f2fs_build_fault_attr().\n- Use f2fs_build_fault_attr() in __sbi_store() to clean up code.(CVE-2024-42160)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nmedia: dvb-frontends: tda10048: Fix integer overflow\r\n\r\nstate-&gt;xtal_hz can be up to 16M, so it can overflow a 32 bit integer\nwhen multiplied by pll_mfactor.\r\n\r\nCreate a new 64 bit variable to hold the calculations.(CVE-2024-42223)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nUSB: serial: mos7840: fix crash on resume\r\n\r\nSince commit c49cfa917025 (&quot;USB: serial: use generic method if no\nalternative is provided in usb serial layer&quot;), USB serial core calls the\ngeneric resume implementation when the driver has not provided one.\r\n\r\nThis can trigger a crash on resume with mos7840 since support for\nmultiple read URBs was added back in 2011.
