In versions prior to 4.1.0 a command Injection vulnerability existed in the gitserver service, present in all Sourcegraph deployments. This vulnerability was caused by a lack of input validation on the host parameter of the `/list-gitolite` endpoint. It was possible to send a crafted request to gitserver that would execute commands inside the container. Successful exploitation requires the ability to send local requests to gitserver. The issue is patched in version 4.1.0.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-41942.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.1.0"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/security/advisories/GHSA-pfm3-23mh-6xjp"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/42553"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
