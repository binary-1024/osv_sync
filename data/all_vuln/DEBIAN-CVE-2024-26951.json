{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-26951","published":"2024-05-01T06:15:11Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:18:17.233007Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-26951"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wireguard: netlink: check for dangling peer via is_dead instead of empty list  If all peers are removed via wg_peer_remove_all(), rather than setting peer_list to empty, the peer is added to a temporary list with a head on the stack of wg_peer_remove_all(). If a netlink dump is resumed and the cursored peer is one that has been removed via wg_peer_remove_all(), it will iterate from that peer and then attempt to dump freed peers.  Fix this by instead checking peer->is_dead, which was explictly created for this purpose. Also move up the device_update_lock lockdep assertion, since reading is_dead relies on that.  It can be reproduced by a small script like:      echo \"Setting config...\"     ip link add dev wg0 type wireguard     wg setconf wg0 /big-config     (             while true; do                     echo \"Showing config...\"                     wg showconf wg0 > /dev/null             done     ) &     sleep 4     wg setconf wg0 <(printf \"[Peer]\\nPublicKey=$(wg genkey)\\n\")  Resulting in:      BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in __lock_acquire+0x182a/0x1b20     Read of size 8 at addr ffff88811956ec70 by task wg/59     CPU: 2 PID: 59 Comm: wg Not tainted 6.8.0-rc2-debug+ #5     Call Trace:      <TASK>      dump_stack_lvl+0x47/0x70      print_address_description.constprop.0+0x2c/0x380      print_report+0xab/0x250      kasan_report+0xba/0xf0      __lock_acquire+0x182a/0x1b20      lock_acquire+0x191/0x4b0      down_read+0x80/0x440      get_peer+0x140/0xcb0      wg_get_device_dump+0x471/0x1130","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.216-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.103-1","5.10.103-1~bpo10+1","5.10.106-1","5.10.113-1","5.10.120-1","5.10.120-1~bpo10+1","5.10.127-1","5.10.127-2","5.10.127-2~bpo10+1","5.10.136-1","5.10.140-1","5.10.148-1","5.10.149-1","5.10.149-2","5.10.158-1","5.10.158-2","5.10.162-1","5.10.178-1","5.10.178-2","5.10.178-3","5.10.179-1","5.10.179-2","5.10.179-3","5.10.179-4","5.10.179-5","5.10.191-1","5.10.197-1","5.10.205-1","5.10.205-2","5.10.209-1","5.10.209-2","5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1","5.10.92-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-26951.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.85-1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.27-1","6.1.37-1","6.1.38-1","6.1.38-2","6.1.38-2~bpo11+1","6.1.38-3","6.1.38-4","6.1.38-4~bpo11+1","6.1.52-1","6.1.55-1","6.1.55-1~bpo11+1","6.1.64-1","6.1.66-1","6.1.67-1","6.1.69-1","6.1.69-1~bpo11+1","6.1.76-1","6.1.76-1~bpo11+1","6.1.82-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-26951.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.7.12-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-26951.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.7.12-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-26951.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-26951"}]}
