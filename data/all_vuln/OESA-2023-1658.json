  "details": "Mosquitto is an open source message broker that implements the MQ Telemetry Transport protocol version 3.1 and 3.1.1 MQTT provides a lightweight method of carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe model. This makes it suitable for &quot;machine to machine&quot; messaging such as with low power sensors or mobile devices such as phones, embedded computers or micro-controllers like the Arduino.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nThe broker in Eclipse Mosquitto 1.3.2 through 2.x before 2.0.16 has a memory leak that can be abused remotely when a client sends many QoS 2 messages with duplicate message IDs, and fails to respond to PUBREC commands. This occurs because of mishandling of EAGAIN from the libc send function.(CVE-2023-28366)",
