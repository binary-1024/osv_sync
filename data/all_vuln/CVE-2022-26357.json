VT-d hardware may allow for only less than 15 bits to hold a domain ID associating a physical device with a particular domain. Therefore internally Xen domain IDs are mapped to the smaller value range. The cleaning up of the housekeeping structures has a race, allowing for VT-d domain IDs to be leaked and flushes to be bypassed.","references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/05/2"},{"type":"FIX","url":"http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-399.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-07"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5117"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-399.txt"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6ETPM2OVZZ6KOS2L7QO7SIW6XWT5OW3F/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UHFSRVLM2JUCPDC2KGB7ETPQYJLCGBLD/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
