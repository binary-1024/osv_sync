This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 140, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.25, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.12, Thunderbird &lt; 140, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.12.(CVE-2025-6424)\n\nAn attacker who enumerated resources from the WebCompat extension could have obtained a persistent UUID that identified the browser, and persisted between containers and normal/private browsing mode, but not profiles. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 140, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.25, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.12, Thunderbird &lt; 140, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.12.(CVE-2025-6425)\n\nFirefox could have incorrectly parsed a URL and rewritten it to the youtube.com domain when parsing the URL specified in an `embed` tag.  This could have bypassed website security checks that restricted which domains users were allowed to embed. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 140, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.12, Thunderbird &lt; 140, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.12.(CVE-2025-6429)\n\nWhen a file download is specified via the `Content-Disposition` header, that directive would be ignored if the file was included via a `&amp;lt;embed&amp;gt;` or `&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;` tag, potentially making a website vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 140 and Firefox ESR &lt; 128.12.(CVE-2025-6430)",
