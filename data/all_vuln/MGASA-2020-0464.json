  "details": "A heap-buffer overwrites error was discovered in lib/openjp2/mqc.c in OpenJPEG\n2.3.1. The vulnerability causes an out-of-bounds write, which may lead to\nremote denial of service or possibly remote code execution (CVE-2020-27814).\n\nA flaw was found in OpenJPEG\u2019s encoder. This flaw allows an attacker to pass\nspecially crafted x,y offset input to OpenJPEG to use during encoding. The\nhighest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as\nwell as system availability (CVE-2020-27823).\n\nThere is a flaw in openjpeg's encoder in the opj_dwt_calc_explicit_stepsizes()\nfunction. An attacker who is able to supply crafted input to decomposition\nlevels could cause a buffer overflow, potentially causing an impact to\napplication availability (CVE-2020-27824).\n",
