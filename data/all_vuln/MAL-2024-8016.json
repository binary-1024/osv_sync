It has a limited risk.\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (bd94b5883ce5258e0025cb6a9984dad056352272a60019b3ca1aeee5e613f8aa)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'artifact-lab-3-package-f0727516' @ 0.1.0 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"artifact-lab-3-package-f0727516","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-f0727516"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/blob/main/osv/malicious/pypi/artifact-lab-3-package-f0727516/MAL-2024-8016.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/pypi/package/artifact-lab-3-package-f0727516"}],"database_specific":{"malicious-packages-origins":[{"import_time":"2024-08-11T09:33:59.423795412Z","modified_time":"2024-08-11T09:15:42Z","sha256":"bd94b5883ce5258e0025cb6a9984dad056352272a60019b3ca1aeee5e613f8aa","source":"ossf-package-analysis","versions":["0.1.0"]},{"id":"pypi/2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell/artifact-lab-3-package-f0727516","import_time":"2025-12-02T22:30:54.937828362Z","modified_time":"2024-08-10T23:05:21Z","ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"}],"type":"ECOSYSTEM"}],"sha256":"946be8a22c399d824a7af75b3bcb46223a15bb54d5bca8b6b5fb06be0e3d8744","source":"kam193"}]},"credits":[{"name":"Kamil Mańkowski (kam193)","contact":["https://github.com/kam193","https://bad-packages.kam193.eu/"]},{"name":"OpenSSF: Package Analysis","contact":["https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis","https://openssf.slack.com/channels/package_analysis"],"type":"FINDER"}]}
