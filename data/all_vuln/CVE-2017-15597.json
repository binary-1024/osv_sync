Grant copying code made an implication that any grant pin would be accompanied by a suitable page reference. Other portions of code, however, did not match up with that assumption. When such a grant copy operation is being done on a grant of a dying domain, the assumption turns out wrong. A malicious guest administrator can cause hypervisor memory corruption, most likely resulting in host crash and a Denial of Service. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out.","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/10/24/3"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101564"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039653"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-236.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX229057"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-4050"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/10/msg00009.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
