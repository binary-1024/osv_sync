However, the documentation says this API call: \"Generates private and public Diffie-Hellman key values\".  The documented behavior is very different from the actual behavior, and this difference could easily lead to security issues in applications that use these APIs as the DiffieHellman may be used as the basis for application-level security, implications are consequently broad.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nodejs","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nodejs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"12.22.12~dfsg-1~deb11u5"}]}],"versions":["12.21.0~dfsg-5","12.22.10~dfsg-1","12.22.10~dfsg-2","12.22.12~dfsg-1~deb11u1","12.22.12~dfsg-1~deb11u2","12.22.12~dfsg-1~deb11u3","12.22.12~dfsg-1~deb11u4","12.22.4~dfsg-1","12.22.5~dfsg-1","12.22.5~dfsg-2","12.22.5~dfsg-2~11u1","12.22.5~dfsg-3","12.22.5~dfsg-4","12.22.5~dfsg-5","12.22.5~dfsg-6","12.22.5~dfsg-7","12.22.7~dfsg-1","12.22.7~dfsg-2","12.22.9~dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-30590.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nodejs","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nodejs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"18.19.0+dfsg-6~deb12u1"}]}],"versions":["18.13.0+dfsg1-1","18.13.0+dfsg1-1.1","18.19.0+dfsg-1","18.19.0+dfsg-2","18.19.0+dfsg-3","18.19.0+dfsg-4","18.19.0+dfsg-5"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-30590.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nodejs","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nodejs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"18.13.0+dfsg1-1.1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-30590.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nodejs","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nodejs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"18.13.0+dfsg1-1.1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-30590.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-30590"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
