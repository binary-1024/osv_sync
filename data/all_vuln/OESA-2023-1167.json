Specifically, systemd does not set LESSSECURE to 1, and thus other programs may be launched from the less program. This presents a substantial security risk when running systemctl from Sudo, because less executes as root when the terminal size is too small to show the complete systemctl output.(CVE-2023-26604)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"systemd","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/systemd&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"243-60.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["systemd-debugsource-243-60.oe1.aarch64.rpm","systemd-devel-243-60.oe1.aarch64.rpm","systemd-libs-243-60.oe1.aarch64.rpm","systemd-udev-243-60.oe1.aarch64.rpm","systemd-journal-remote-243-60.oe1.aarch64.rpm","systemd-udev-compat-243-60.oe1.aarch64.rpm","systemd-container-243-60.oe1.aarch64.rpm","systemd-debuginfo-243-60.oe1.aarch64.rpm","systemd-243-60.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["systemd-help-243-60.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["systemd-243-60.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["systemd-debugsource-243-60.oe1.x86_64.rpm","systemd-libs-243-60.oe1.x86_64.rpm","systemd-container-243-60.oe1.x86_64.rpm","systemd-udev-compat-243-60.oe1.x86_64.rpm","systemd-243-60.oe1.x86_64.rpm","systemd-journal-remote-243-60.oe1.x86_64.rpm","systemd-udev-243-60.oe1.x86_64.rpm","systemd-devel-243-60.oe1.x86_64.rpm","systemd-debuginfo-243-60.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2023-1167.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2023-1167"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26604"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
