When resolving dependencies in versions before 9.3.0, some exceptions were not treated as fatal errors and would not cause a repository to be disabled. If a build encountered one of these exceptions, Gradle would continue to the next repository in the list and potentially resolve dependencies from a different repository. An exception like NoHttpResponseException can indicate transient errors. If the errors persist after a maximum number of retries, Gradle would continue to the next repository. This behavior could allow an attacker to disrupt the service of a repository and leverage another repository to serve malicious artifacts. This attack requires the attacker to have control over a repository after the disrupted repository. Gradle has introduced a change in behavior in Gradle 9.3.0 to stop searching other repositories when encountering these errors.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gradle","ecosystem":"Bitnami","purl":"pkg:bitnami/gradle"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.3.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/bitnami/vulndb/tree/main/data/gradle/BIT-gradle-2026-22865.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:H/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/gradle/gradle/security/advisories/GHSA-mqwm-5m85-gmcv"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22865"}],"database_specific":{"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:gradle:gradle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"severity":"High"}}
