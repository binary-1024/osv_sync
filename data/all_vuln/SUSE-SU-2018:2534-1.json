  "details": "This update for compat-openssl097g fixes the following issues:\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2018-0732: During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based\n  ciphersuite a malicious server could have sent a very large prime value to the\n  client. This caused the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time\n  generating a key for this prime resulting in a hang until the client has\n  finished. This could be exploited in a Denial Of Service attack (bsc#1097158)\n- CVE-2018-0739: Constructed ASN.1 types with a recursive definition (such as\n  can be found in PKCS7) could eventually exceed the stack given malicious input\n  with excessive recursion. This could have resulted in DoS (bsc#1087102)\n\nThis non-security issue was fixed:\n\n- Fixed crash in DES_fcrypt (bsc#1065363)\n",
