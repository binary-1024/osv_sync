We read rle_raw_size from the input file at [0], we decompress and decode into the buffer td->rle_raw_data of size rle_raw_size at [1], and then at [2] we will access entries in this buffer up to (td->xsize - 1) * (td->ysize - 1) + rle_raw_size / 2, which may exceed rle_raw_size.     We recommend upgrading to version 8.0 or beyond.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ffmpeg","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ffmpeg?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["7:4.3.2-0+deb11u2","7:4.3.2-1","7:4.3.2-2","7:4.3.3-0+deb11u1","7:4.3.4-0+deb11u1","7:4.3.5-0+deb11u1","7:4.3.6-0+deb11u1","7:4.3.7-0+deb11u1","7:4.3.8-0+deb11u1","7:4.3.8-0+deb11u2","7:4.3.8-0+deb11u3","7:4.3.9-0+deb11u1","7:4.4-1","7:4.4-2","7:4.4-3","7:4.4-4","7:4.4-5","7:4.4-6","7:4.4.1-1","7:4.4.1-2","7:4.4.1-2+ports","7:4.4.1-3","7:4.4.2-1","7:5.0-1","7:5.0-2","7:5.0-3","7:5.0.1-1","7:5.0.1-2","7:5.0.1-3","7:5.1-1","7:5.1-2","7:5.1-2.1","7:5.1-3","7:5.1.1-1","7:5.1.1-2","7:5.1.1-2+m68k","7:5.1.2-1","7:5.1.2-2","7:5.1.2-3","7:5.1.3-1","7:5.1.3-2","7:6.0-1","7:6.0-2","7:6.0-3","7:6.0-4","7:6.0-5","7:6.0-6","7:6.0-7","7:6.0-8","7:6.0-9","7:6.1-1","7:6.1-2","7:6.1-3","7:6.1-4","7:6.1-5","7:6.1.1-1","7:6.1.1-2","7:6.1.1-3","7:6.1.1-4","7:6.1.1-5","7:7.0-1","7:7.0.1-1","7:7.0.1-2","7:7.0.1-3","7:7.0.1-4","7:7.0.1-5","7:7.0.2-1","7:7.0.2-2","7:7.0.2-3","7:7.1-1","7:7.1-2","7:7.1-3","7:7.1-4","7:7.1.1-1","7:7.1.2-1","7:8.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-59731.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ffmpeg","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ffmpeg?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7:5.1.7-0+deb12u1"}]}],"versions":["7:5.1.3-1","7:5.1.3-2","7:5.1.4-0+deb12u1","7:5.1.5-0+deb12u1","7:5.1.6-0+deb12u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-59731.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ffmpeg","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ffmpeg?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7:7.1.2-0+deb13u1"}]}],"versions":["7:7.1.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-59731.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ffmpeg","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ffmpeg?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7:7.1.2-1"}]}],"versions":["7:7.1.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-59731.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-59731"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:H/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
