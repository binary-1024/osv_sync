For example, this can be triggered by an unrelated self-signed CA certificate sent by an initiator. Remote code execution cannot occur.(CVE-2021-41990)\r\n\r\nThe in-memory certificate cache in strongSwan before 5.9.4 has a remote integer overflow upon receiving many requests with different certificates to fill the cache and later trigger the replacement of cache entries. The code attempts to select a less-often-used cache entry by means of a random number generator, but this is not done correctly.
