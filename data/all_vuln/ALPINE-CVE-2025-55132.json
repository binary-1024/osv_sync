Unlike `utimes()`, `futimes()` does not apply the expected write-permission checks, which means file metadata can be modified in read-only directories. This behavior could be used to alter timestamps in ways that obscure activity, reducing the reliability of logs. This vulnerability affects users of the permission model on Node.js v20,  v22,  v24, and v25.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nodejs","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.23","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nodejs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"24.13.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["22.11.0-r0","22.11.0-r1","22.11.0-r2","22.13.1-r0","22.13.1-r1","22.13.1-r2","22.13.1-r3","22.13.1-r4","22.13.1-r5","22.16.0-r0","22.16.0-r1","22.16.0-r2","22.16.0-r3","22.19.0-r3","22.19.0-r4","22.21.0-r0","24.11.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-55132.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2025-55132"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
