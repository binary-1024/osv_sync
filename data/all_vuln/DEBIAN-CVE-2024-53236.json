  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xsk: Free skb when TX metadata options are invalid  When a new skb is allocated for transmitting an xsk descriptor, i.e., for every non-multibuf descriptor or the first frag of a multibuf descriptor, but the descriptor is later found to have invalid options set for the TX metadata, the new skb is never freed. This can leak skbs until the send buffer is full which makes sending more packets impossible.  Fix this by freeing the skb in the error path if we are currently dealing with the first frag, i.e., an skb allocated in this iteration of xsk_build_skb.",
