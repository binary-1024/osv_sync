This issue could allow a privileged guest user to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service.(CVE-2023-3019)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the QEMU built-in VNC server while processing ClientCutText messages. The qemu_clipboard_request() function can be reached before vnc_server_cut_text_caps() was called and had the chance to initialize the clipboard peer, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. This could allow a malicious authenticated VNC client to crash QEMU and trigger a denial of service.(CVE-2023-6683)\r\n\r\nA stack based buffer overflow was found in the virtio-net device of QEMU. This issue occurs when flushing TX in the virtio_net_flush_tx function if guest features VIRTIO_NET_F_HASH_REPORT, VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1 and VIRTIO_NET_F_MRG_RXBUF are enabled. This could allow a malicious user to overwrite local variables allocated on the stack. Specifically, the `out_sg` variable could be used to read a part of process memory and send it to the wire, causing an information leak.(CVE-2023-6693)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"qemu","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/qemu&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["qemu-debuginfo-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-block-curl-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-block-ssh-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-block-iscsi-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-block-rbd-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-debugsource-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-system-riscv-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-img-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-system-aarch64-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-hw-usb-host-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-system-arm-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-guest-agent-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-system-x86_64-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["qemu-help-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["qemu-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["qemu-block-ssh-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-system-aarch64-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-system-arm-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-block-curl-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-block-iscsi-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-guest-agent-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-seabios-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-debugsource-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-system-riscv-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-hw-usb-host-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-img-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-block-rbd-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-system-x86_64-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-debuginfo-6.2.0-89.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-1312.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2024-1312"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3019"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-6683"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-6693"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
