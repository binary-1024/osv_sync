  "details": "### Overview\nA security review of the Cattown identified multiple weaknesses that could potentially impact its stability and security.\n\n### Affected Versions\n- All versions below 1.0.2\n\n### Description of Vulnerabilities\n1. CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\nThe package used regular expressions with inefficient, potentially exponential worst-case complexity. This can cause excessive CPU usage due to excessive backtracking on crafted inputs, potentially leading to denial of service.\n2. CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (Resource Exhaustion)\nThe package was vulnerable to resource exhaustion, where processing malicious inputs could cause high CPU or memory usage, potentially leading to denial of service.\n\n### Impact\n- Trigger excessive CPU consumption leading to denial of service\n- Cause resource exhaustion affecting service availability\n- Bypass protection mechanisms causing unexpected or insecure behavior\n\n### Resolution\nThese vulnerabilities have been fixed in version 1.0.2 of the Cattown. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to this version to mitigate the risks.\n\n### Recommendations\n- Upgrade to Cattown version 1.0.2 or later as soon as possible.\n- Review and restrict input sources if untrusted inputs are processed.\n\n### Acknowledgments\nThe issues were proactively identified through CodeQL static analysis.",
