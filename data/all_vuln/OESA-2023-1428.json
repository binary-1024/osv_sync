To achieve a successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection.(CVE-2022-4304)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"edk2","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/edk2&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"202002-17.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["edk2-debugsource-202002-17.oe1.aarch64.rpm","edk2-devel-202002-17.oe1.aarch64.rpm","edk2-debuginfo-202002-17.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["python3-edk2-devel-202002-17.oe1.noarch.rpm","edk2-aarch64-202002-17.oe1.noarch.rpm","edk2-ovmf-202002-17.oe1.noarch.rpm","edk2-help-202002-17.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["edk2-202002-17.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["edk2-debugsource-202002-17.oe1.x86_64.rpm","edk2-debuginfo-202002-17.oe1.x86_64.rpm","edk2-devel-202002-17.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2023-1428.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2023-1428"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4304"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
