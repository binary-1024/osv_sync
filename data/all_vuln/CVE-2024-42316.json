  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/mglru: fix div-by-zero in vmpressure_calc_level()\n\nevict_folios() uses a second pass to reclaim folios that have gone through\npage writeback and become clean before it finishes the first pass, since\nfolio_rotate_reclaimable() cannot handle those folios due to the\nisolation.\n\nThe second pass tries to avoid potential double counting by deducting\nscan_control->nr_scanned.  However, this can result in underflow of\nnr_scanned, under a condition where shrink_folio_list() does not increment\nnr_scanned, i.e., when folio_trylock() fails.\n\nThe underflow can cause the divisor, i.e., scale=scanned+reclaimed in\nvmpressure_calc_level(), to become zero, resulting in the following crash:\n\n  [exception RIP: vmpressure_work_fn+101]\n  process_one_work at ffffffffa3313f2b\n\nSince scan_control->nr_scanned has no established semantics, the potential\ndouble counting has minimal risks.  Therefore, fix the problem by not\ndeducting scan_control->nr_scanned in evict_folios().",
