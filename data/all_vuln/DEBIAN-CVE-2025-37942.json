  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: pidff: Make sure to fetch pool before checking SIMULTANEOUS_MAX  As noted by Anssi some 20 years ago, pool report is sometimes messed up. This worked fine on many devices but casued oops on VRS DirectForce PRO.  Here, we're making sure pool report is refetched before trying to access any of it's fields. While loop was replaced with a for loop + exit conditions were moved aroud to decrease the possibility of creating an infinite loop scenario.",
