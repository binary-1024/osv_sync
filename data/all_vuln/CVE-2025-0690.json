During this process, with a line big enough it's possible to make this variable to overflow leading to a out-of-bounds write in the heap based buffer. This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grub's internal critical data and secure boot bypass is not discarded as consequence.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:6990"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2346123"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-0690"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2025-02/msg00024.html"}]}
