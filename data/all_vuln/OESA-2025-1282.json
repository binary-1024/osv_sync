However,\ngiven the &apos;static&apos; scope of nvidia_setup_i2c_bus() it looks\nlike that can&apos;t happen after examiniing the call sites.\n\nCID 19036 (#1 of 1): Copy into fixed size buffer (STRING_OVERFLOW)\n1. fixed_size_dest: You might overrun the 48-character fixed-size string\n  chan-&gt;adapter.name by copying name without checking the length.\n2. parameter_as_source: Note: This defect has an elevated risk because the\n  source argument is a parameter of the current function.\n 89        strcpy(chan-&gt;adapter.name, name);\n\nFix this warning by using strscpy() which will silence the warning and\nprevent any future buffer overflows should the names used to identify the\nchannel become much longer.(CVE-2021-47642)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm integrity: fix memory corruption when tag_size is less than digest size\n\nIt is possible to set up dm-integrity in such a way that the\n&quot;tag_size&quot; parameter is less than the actual digest size. In this\nsituation, a part of the digest beyond tag_size is ignored.\n\nIn this case, dm-integrity would write beyond the end of the\nic-&gt;recalc_tags array and corrupt memory. The corruption happened in\nintegrity_recalc-&gt;integrity_sector_checksum-&gt;crypto_shash_final.\n\nFix this corruption by increasing the tags array so that it has enough\npadding at the end to accomodate the loop in integrity_recalc() being\nable to write a full digest size for the last member of the tags\narray.(CVE-2022-49044)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdkfd: Check for potential null return of kmalloc_array()\n\nAs the kmalloc_array() may return null, the &apos;event_waiters[i].wait&apos; would lead to null-pointer dereference.\nTherefore, it is better to check the return value of kmalloc_array() to avoid this confusion.(CVE-2022-49055)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: libfc: Fix use after free in fc_exch_abts_resp()\n\nfc_exch_release(ep) will decrease the ep&apos;s reference count. When the\nreference count reaches zero, it is freed. But ep is still used in the\nfollowing code, which will lead to a use after free.\n\nReturn after the fc_exch_release() call to avoid use after free.(CVE-2022-49114)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_cs: fix refcount leak of a dma_fence obj\n\nThis issue takes place in an error path in\namdgpu_cs_fence_to_handle_ioctl(). When `info-&gt;in.what` falls into\ndefault case, the function simply returns -EINVAL, forgetting to\ndecrement the reference count of a dma_fence obj, which is bumped\nearlier by amdgpu_cs_get_fence(). This may result in reference count\nleaks.\n\nFix it by decreasing the refcount of specific object before returning\nthe error code.(CVE-2022-49137)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: usb: go7007: s2250-board: fix leak in probe()\n\nCall i2c_unregister_device(audio) on this error path.(CVE-2022-49253)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nextcon: Modify extcon device to be created after driver data is set\n\nCurrently, someone can invoke the sysfs such as state_show()\nintermittently before dev_set_drvdata() is done.\nAnd it can be a cause of kernel Oops because of edev is Null at that time.\nSo modified the driver registration to after setting drviver data.\n\n- Oops&apos;s backtrace.\n\nBacktrace:\n[&lt;c067865c&gt;] (state_show) from [&lt;c05222e8&gt;] (dev_attr_show)\n[&lt;c05222c0&gt;] (dev_attr_show) from [&lt;c02c66e0&gt;] (sysfs_kf_seq_show)\n[&lt;c02c6648&gt;] (sysfs_kf_seq_show) from [&lt;c02c496c&gt;] (kernfs_seq_show)\n[&lt;c02c4938&gt;] (kernfs_seq_show) from [&lt;c025e2a0&gt;] (seq_read)\n[&lt;c025e11c&gt;] (seq_read) from [&lt;c02c50a0&gt;] (kernfs_fop_read)\n[&lt;c02c5064&gt;] (kernfs_fop_read) from [&lt;c0231cac&gt;] (__vfs_read)\n[&lt;c0231c5c&gt;] (__vfs_read) from [&lt;c0231ee0&gt;] (vfs_read)\n[&lt;c0231e34&gt;] (vfs_read) from [&lt;c0232464&gt;] (ksys_read)\n[&lt;c02323f0&gt;] (ksys_read) from [&lt;c02324fc&gt;] (sys_read)\n[&lt;c02324e4&gt;] (sys_read) from [&lt;c00091d0&gt;] (__sys_trace_return)(CVE-2022-49308)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrtl818x: Prevent using not initialized queues\n\nUsing not existing queues can panic the kernel with rtl8180/rtl8185 cards.\nIgnore the skb priority for those cards, they only have one tx queue. Pierre\nAsselin (pa@panix.com) reported the kernel crash in the Gentoo forum:\n\nhttps://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1147832-postdays-0-postorder-asc-start-25.html\n\nHe also confirmed that this patch fixes the issue. In summary this happened:\n\nAfter updating wpa_supplicant from 2.9 to 2.10 the kernel crashed with a\n&quot;divide error: 0000&quot; when connecting to an AP. Control port tx now tries to\nuse IEEE80211_AC_VO for the priority, which wpa_supplicants starts to use in\n2.10.\n\nSince only the rtl8187se part of the driver supports QoS, the priority\nof the skb is set to IEEE80211_AC_BE (2) by mac80211 for rtl8180/rtl8185\ncards.\n\nrtl8180 is then unconditionally reading out the priority and finally crashes on\ndrivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtl818x/rtl8180/dev.c line 544 without this\npatch:\n\tidx = (ring-&gt;idx + skb_queue_len(&amp;ring-&gt;queue)) % ring-&gt;entries\n\n&quot;ring-&gt;entries&quot; is zero for rtl8180/rtl8185 cards, tx_ring[2] never got\ninitialized.(CVE-2022-49326)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf, arm64: Clear prog-&gt;jited_len along prog-&gt;jited\n\nsyzbot reported an illegal copy_to_user() attempt\nfrom bpf_prog_get_info_by_fd() [1]\n\nThere was no repro yet on this bug, but I think\nthat commit 0aef499f3172 (&quot;mm/usercopy: Detect vmalloc overruns&quot;)\nis exposing a prior bug in bpf arm64.\n\nbpf_prog_get_info_by_fd() looks at prog-&gt;jited_len\nto determine if the JIT image can be copied out to user space.\n\nMy theory is that syzbot managed to get a prog where prog-&gt;jited_len\nhas been set to 43, while prog-&gt;bpf_func has ben cleared.\n\nIt is not clear why copy_to_user(uinsns, NULL, ulen) is triggering\nthis particular warning.\n\nI thought find_vma_area(NULL) would not find a vm_struct.\nAs we do not hold vmap_area_lock spinlock, it might be possible\nthat the found vm_struct was garbage.\n\n[1]\nusercopy: Kernel memory exposure attempt detected from vmalloc (offset 792633534417210172, size 43)!\nkernel BUG at mm/usercopy.c:101!\nInternal error: Oops - BUG: 0 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 0 PID: 25002 Comm: syz-executor.1 Not tainted 5.18.0-syzkaller-10139-g8291eaafed36 #0\nHardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)\npstate: 60400009 (nZCv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)\npc : usercopy_abort+0x90/0x94 mm/usercopy.c:101\nlr : usercopy_abort+0x90/0x94 mm/usercopy.c:89\nsp : ffff80000b773a20\nx29: ffff80000b773a30 x28: faff80000b745000 x27: ffff80000b773b48\nx26: 0000000000000000 x25: 000000000000002b x24: 0000000000000000\nx23: 00000000000000e0 x22: ffff80000b75db67 x21: 0000000000000001\nx20: 000000000000002b x19: ffff80000b75db3c x18: 00000000fffffffd\nx17: 2820636f6c6c616d x16: 76206d6f72662064 x15: 6574636574656420\nx14: 74706d6574746120 x13: 2129333420657a69 x12: 73202c3237313031\nx11: 3237313434333533 x10: 3336323937207465 x9 : 657275736f707865\nx8 : ffff80000a30c550 x7 : ffff80000b773830 x6 : ffff80000b773830\nx5 : 0000000000000000 x4 : ffff00007fbbaa10 x3 : 0000000000000000\nx2 : 0000000000000000 x1 : f7ff000028fc0000 x0 : 0000000000000064\nCall trace:\n usercopy_abort+0x90/0x94 mm/usercopy.c:89\n check_heap_object mm/usercopy.c:186 [inline]\n __check_object_size mm/usercopy.c:252 [inline]\n __check_object_size+0x198/0x36c mm/usercopy.c:214\n check_object_size include/linux/thread_info.h:199 [inline]\n check_copy_size include/linux/thread_info.h:235 [inline]\n copy_to_user include/linux/uaccess.h:159 [inline]\n bpf_prog_get_info_by_fd.isra.0+0xf14/0xfdc kernel/bpf/syscall.c:3993\n bpf_obj_get_info_by_fd+0x12c/0x510 kernel/bpf/syscall.c:4253\n __sys_bpf+0x900/0x2150 kernel/bpf/syscall.c:4956\n __do_sys_bpf kernel/bpf/syscall.c:5021 [inline]\n __se_sys_bpf kernel/bpf/syscall.c:5019 [inline]\n __arm64_sys_bpf+0x28/0x40 kernel/bpf/syscall.c:5019\n __invoke_syscall arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:38 [inline]\n invoke_syscall+0x48/0x114 arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:52\n el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0x44/0xec arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:142\n do_el0_svc+0xa0/0xc0 arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:206\n el0_svc+0x44/0xb0 arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c:624\n el0t_64_sync_handler+0x1ac/0x1b0 arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c:642\n el0t_64_sync+0x198/0x19c arch/arm64/kernel/entry.S:581\nCode: aa0003e3 d00038c0 91248000 97fff65f (d4210000)(CVE-2022-49341)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: altera: Fix refcount leak in altera_tse_mdio_create\n\nEvery iteration of for_each_child_of_node() decrements\nthe reference count of the previous node.\nWhen break from a for_each_child_of_node() loop,\nwe need to explicitly call of_node_put() on the child node when\nnot need anymore.\nAdd missing of_node_put() to avoid refcount leak.(CVE-2022-49351)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/hfi1: Fix potential integer multiplication overflow errors\n\nWhen multiplying of different types, an overflow is possible even when\nstoring the result in a larger type.

As a result, this may be leaking DMA memory that&apos;s\nbeen used by the driver.\n\nThis commit is an adaptation of the techniques found in the esd_usb2\ndriver where a similar design pattern led to a memory leak. It\nexplicitly frees the RX URBs and their DMA memory via a call to\nusb_free_coherent(). Since the RX URBs were allocated in the\ngs_can_open(), we remove them in gs_can_close() rather than in the\ndisconnect function as was done in esd_usb2.\n\nFor more information, see the 928150fad41b (&quot;can: esd_usb2: fix memory\nleak&quot;).(CVE-2022-49661)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: trigger: sysfs: fix use-after-free on remove\n\nEnsure that the irq_work has completed before the trigger is freed.\n\n ==================================================================\n BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in irq_work_run_list\n Read of size 8 at addr 0000000064702248 by task python3/25\n\n Call Trace:\n  irq_work_run_list\n  irq_work_tick\n  update_process_times\n  tick_sched_handle\n  tick_sched_timer\n  __hrtimer_run_queues\n  hrtimer_interrupt\n\n Allocated by task 25:\n  kmem_cache_alloc_trace\n  iio_sysfs_trig_add\n  dev_attr_store\n  sysfs_kf_write\n  kernfs_fop_write_iter\n  new_sync_write\n  vfs_write\n  ksys_write\n  sys_write\n\n Freed by task 25:\n  kfree\n  iio_sysfs_trig_remove\n  dev_attr_store\n  sysfs_kf_write\n  kernfs_fop_write_iter\n  new_sync_write\n  vfs_write\n  ksys_write\n  sys_write\n\n ==================================================================(CVE-2022-49685)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncifs: Fix UAF in cifs_demultiplex_thread()\n\nThere is a UAF when xfstests on cifs:\n\n  BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in smb2_is_network_name_deleted+0x27/0x160\n  Read of size 4 at addr ffff88810103fc08 by task cifsd/923\n\n  CPU: 1 PID: 923 Comm: cifsd Not tainted 6.1.0-rc4+ #45\n  ...\n  Call Trace:\n   &lt;TASK&gt;\n   dump_stack_lvl+0x34/0x44\n   print_report+0x171/0x472\n   kasan_report+0xad/0x130\n   kasan_check_range+0x145/0x1a0\n   smb2_is_network_name_deleted+0x27/0x160\n   cifs_demultiplex_thread.cold+0x172/0x5a4\n   kthread+0x165/0x1a0\n   ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30\n   &lt;/TASK&gt;\n\n  Allocated by task 923:\n   kasan_save_stack+0x1e/0x40\n   kasan_set_track+0x21/0x30\n   __kasan_slab_alloc+0x54/0x60\n   kmem_cache_alloc+0x147/0x320\n   mempool_alloc+0xe1/0x260\n   cifs_small_buf_get+0x24/0x60\n   allocate_buffers+0xa1/0x1c0\n   cifs_demultiplex_thread+0x199/0x10d0\n   kthread+0x165/0x1a0\n   ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30\n\n  Freed by task 921:\n   kasan_save_stack+0x1e/0x40\n   kasan_set_track+0x21/0x30\n   kasan_save_free_info+0x2a/0x40\n   ____kasan_slab_free+0x143/0x1b0\n   kmem_cache_free+0xe3/0x4d0\n   cifs_small_buf_release+0x29/0x90\n   SMB2_negotiate+0x8b7/0x1c60\n   smb2_negotiate+0x51/0x70\n   cifs_negotiate_protocol+0xf0/0x160\n   cifs_get_smb_ses+0x5fa/0x13c0\n   mount_get_conns+0x7a/0x750\n   cifs_mount+0x103/0xd00\n   cifs_smb3_do_mount+0x1dd/0xcb0\n   smb3_get_tree+0x1d5/0x300\n   vfs_get_tree+0x41/0xf0\n   path_mount+0x9b3/0xdd0\n   __x64_sys_mount+0x190/0x1d0\n   do_syscall_64+0x35/0x80\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x46/0xb0\n\nThe UAF is because:\n\n mount(pid: 921)               | cifsd(pid: 923)\n-------------------------------|-------------------------------\n                               | cifs_demultiplex_thread\nSMB2_negotiate                 |\n cifs_send_recv                |\n  compound_send_recv           |\n   smb_send_rqst               |\n    wait_for_response          |\n     wait_event_state      [1] |\n                               |  standard_receive3\n                               |   cifs_handle_standard\n                               |    handle_mid\n                               |     mid-&gt;resp_buf = buf;  [2]\n                               |     dequeue_mid           [3]\n     KILL the process      [4] |\n    resp_iov[i].iov_base = buf |\n free_rsp_buf              [5] |\n                               |   is_network_name_deleted [6]\n                               |   callback\n\n1.

And net/ implementations\nseem to base their user vs kernel space operations on it.\n\ne.g. upon TCP socket close, the TCP timers are not cleared because\nsk-&gt;sk_net_refcnt=1:\n(cf. commit 151c9c724d05 (&quot;tcp: properly terminate timers for kernel sockets&quot;))\n\nnet/ipv4/tcp.c:\n    void tcp_close(struct sock *sk, long timeout)\n    {\n    \tlock_sock(sk);\n    \t__tcp_close(sk, timeout);\n    \trelease_sock(sk);\n    \tif (!sk-&gt;sk_net_refcnt)\n    \t\tinet_csk_clear_xmit_timers_sync(sk);\n    \tsock_put(sk);\n    }\n\nWhich will throw a lockdep warning and then, as expected, deadlock on\ntcp_write_timer().\n\nA way to reproduce this is by running the reproducer from ef7134c7fc48\nand then &apos;rmmod cifs&apos;.  A few seconds later, the deadlock/lockdep\nwarning shows up.\n\nFix:\nWe shouldn&apos;t mess with socket internals ourselves, so do not set\nsk_net_refcnt manually.\n\nAlso change __sock_create() to sock_create_kern() for explicitness.\n\nAs for non-init_net network namespaces, we deal with it the best way\nwe can -- hold an extra netns reference for server-&gt;ssocket and drop it\nwhen it&apos;s released.  This ensures that the netns still exists whenever\nwe need to create/destroy server-&gt;ssocket, but is not directly tied to\nit.(CVE-2024-54680)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhfsplus: don&apos;t query the device logical block size multiple times\n\nDevices block sizes may change. One of these cases is a loop device by\nusing ioctl LOOP_SET_BLOCK_SIZE.\n\nWhile this may cause other issues like IO being rejected, in the case of\nhfsplus, it will allocate a block by using that size and potentially write\nout-of-bounds when hfsplus_read_wrapper calls hfsplus_submit_bio and the\nlatter function reads a different io_size.\n\nUsing a new min_io_size initally set to sb_min_blocksize works for the\npurposes of the original fix, since it will be set to the max between\nHFSPLUS_SECTOR_SIZE and the first seen logical block size. We still use the\nmax between HFSPLUS_SECTOR_SIZE and min_io_size in case the latter is not\ninitialized.\n\nTested by mounting an hfsplus filesystem with loop block sizes 512, 1024\nand 4096.\n\nThe produced KASAN report before the fix looks like this:\n\n[  419.944641] ==================================================================\n[  419.945655] BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.946703] Read of size 2 at addr ffff88800721fc00 by task repro/10678\n[  419.947612]\n[  419.947846] CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 10678 Comm: repro Not tainted 6.12.0-rc5-00008-gdf56e0f2f3ca #84\n[  419.949007] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.15.0-1 04/01/2014\n[  419.950035] Call Trace:\n[  419.950384]  &lt;TASK&gt;\n[  419.950676]  dump_stack_lvl+0x57/0x78\n[  419.951212]  ? hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.951830]  print_report+0x14c/0x49e\n[  419.952361]  ? __virt_addr_valid+0x267/0x278\n[  419.952979]  ? kmem_cache_debug_flags+0xc/0x1d\n[  419.953561]  ? hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.954231]  kasan_report+0x89/0xb0\n[  419.954748]  ? hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.955367]  hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.955948]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x10/0x10\n[  419.956618]  ? do_raw_spin_unlock+0x59/0x1a9\n[  419.957214]  ? _raw_spin_unlock+0x1a/0x2e\n[  419.957772]  hfsplus_fill_super+0x348/0x1590\n[  419.958355]  ? hlock_class+0x4c/0x109\n[  419.958867]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_fill_super+0x10/0x10\n[  419.959499]  ? __pfx_string+0x10/0x10\n[  419.960006]  ? lock_acquire+0x3e2/0x454\n[  419.960532]  ? bdev_name.constprop.0+0xce/0x243\n[  419.961129]  ? __pfx_bdev_name.constprop.0+0x10/0x10\n[  419.961799]  ? pointer+0x3f0/0x62f\n[  419.962277]  ? __pfx_pointer+0x10/0x10\n[  419.962761]  ? vsnprintf+0x6c4/0xfba\n[  419.963178]  ? __pfx_vsnprintf+0x10/0x10\n[  419.963621]  ? setup_bdev_super+0x376/0x3b3\n[  419.964029]  ? snprintf+0x9d/0xd2\n[  419.964344]  ? __pfx_snprintf+0x10/0x10\n[  419.964675]  ? lock_acquired+0x45c/0x5e9\n[  419.965016]  ? set_blocksize+0x139/0x1c1\n[  419.965381]  ? sb_set_blocksize+0x6d/0xae\n[  419.965742]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_fill_super+0x10/0x10\n[  419.966179]  mount_bdev+0x12f/0x1bf\n[  419.966512]  ? __pfx_mount_bdev+0x10/0x10\n[  419.966886]  ? vfs_parse_fs_string+0xce/0x111\n[  419.967293]  ? __pfx_vfs_parse_fs_string+0x10/0x10\n[  419.967702]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_mount+0x10/0x10\n[  419.968073]  legacy_get_tree+0x104/0x178\n[  419.968414]  vfs_get_tree+0x86/0x296\n[  419.968751]  path_mount+0xba3/0xd0b\n[  419.969157]  ? __pfx_path_mount+0x10/0x10\n[  419.969594]  ? kmem_cache_free+0x1e2/0x260\n[  419.970311]  do_mount+0x99/0xe0\n[  419.970630]  ? __pfx_do_mount+0x10/0x10\n[  419.971008]  __do_sys_mount+0x199/0x1c9\n[  419.971397]  do_syscall_64+0xd0/0x135\n[  419.971761]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n[  419.972233] RIP: 0033:0x7c3cb812972e\n[  419.972564] Code: 48 8b 0d f5 46 0d 00 f7 d8 64 89 01 48 83 c8 ff c3 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 90 f3 0f 1e fa 49 89 ca b8 a5 00 00 00 0f 05 &lt;48&gt; 3d 01 f0 ff ff 73 01 c3 48 8b 0d c2 46 0d 00 f7 d8 64 89 01 48\n[  419.974371] RSP: 002b:00007ffe30632548 EFLAGS: 00000286 ORIG_RAX: 00000000000000a5\n[  419.975048] RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007ffe306328d8 RCX: 00007c3cb812972e\n[  419.975701] RDX: 0000000020000000 RSI: 0000000020000c80 RDI:\n---truncated---(CVE-2024-56548)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naf_packet: avoid erroring out after sock_init_data() in packet_create()\n\nAfter sock_init_data() the allocated sk object is attached to the provided\nsock object.

Finally, pfifo_tail_enqueue() return\n`NET_XMIT_CN` status code.\n\nWeird behaviour:\nIn case we set `sch-&gt;limit == 0` and trigger pfifo_tail_enqueue() on a\nscheduler that has no packet, the &apos;drop a packet&apos; step will do nothing.\nThis means the scheduler&apos;s qlen still has value equal 0.\nThen, we continue to enqueue new packet and increase scheduler&apos;s qlen by\none. In summary, we can leverage pfifo_tail_enqueue() to increase qlen by\none and return `NET_XMIT_CN` status code.\n\nThe problem is:\nLet&apos;s say we have two qdiscs: Qdisc_A and Qdisc_B.\n - Qdisc_A&apos;s type must have &apos;-&gt;graft()&apos; function to create parent/child relationship.\n   Let&apos;s say Qdisc_A&apos;s type is `hfsc`. Enqueue packet to this qdisc will trigger `hfsc_enqueue`.\n - Qdisc_B&apos;s type is pfifo_head_drop. Enqueue packet to this qdisc will trigger `pfifo_tail_enqueue`.\n - Qdisc_B is configured to have `sch-&gt;limit == 0`.\n - Qdisc_A is configured to route the enqueued&apos;s packet to Qdisc_B.\n\nEnqueue packet through Qdisc_A will lead to:\n - hfsc_enqueue(Qdisc_A) -&gt; pfifo_tail_enqueue(Qdisc_B)\n - Qdisc_B-&gt;q.qlen += 1\n - pfifo_tail_enqueue() return `NET_XMIT_CN`\n - hfsc_enqueue() check for `NET_XMIT_SUCCESS` and see `NET_XMIT_CN` =&gt; hfsc_enqueue() don&apos;t increase qlen of Qdisc_A.\n\nThe whole process lead to a situation where Qdisc_A-&gt;q.qlen == 0 and Qdisc_B-&gt;q.qlen == 1.\nReplace &apos;hfsc&apos; with other type (for example: &apos;drr&apos;) still lead to the same problem.\nThis violate the design where parent&apos;s qlen should equal to the sum of its childrens&apos;qlen.\n\nBug impact: This issue can be used for user-&gt;kernel privilege escalation when it is reachable.(CVE-2025-21702)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kernel","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/kernel&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["bpftool-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["kernel-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["bpftool-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2503.3.0.0319.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1282.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-1282"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-47631"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-47642"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49044"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49055"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49114"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49137"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49253"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49308"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49326"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49341"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49351"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49404"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49433"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49439"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49447"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49526"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49564"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49620"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49648"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49661"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49685"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52572"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-54680"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56548"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56606"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21700"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21702"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
