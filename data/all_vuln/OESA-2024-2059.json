This mishandling could leave a client connection in an invalid state, where the next request sent on the connection will fail. An attacker sending a request to a net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy proxy can exploit this mishandling to cause a denial of service by sending &quot;Expect: 100-continue&quot; requests which elicit a non-informational response from the backend. Each such request leaves the proxy with an invalid connection, and causes one subsequent request using that connection to fail.(CVE-2024-24791)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"golang","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/golang&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.17.3-35.oe2203sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["golang-1.17.3-35.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["golang-devel-1.17.3-35.oe2203sp4.noarch.rpm","golang-help-1.17.3-35.oe2203sp4.noarch.rpm"],"src":["golang-1.17.3-35.oe2203sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["golang-1.17.3-35.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-2059.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2024-2059"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24791"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
