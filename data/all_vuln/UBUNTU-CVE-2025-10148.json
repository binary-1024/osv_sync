Instead it used a fixed mask that persisted and was used throughout the entire connection. A predictable mask pattern allows for a malicious server to induce traffic between the two communicating parties that could be interpreted by an involved proxy (configured or transparent) as genuine, real, HTTP traffic with content and thereby poison its cache. That cached poisoned content could then be served to all users of that proxy.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/curl@8.5.0-2ubuntu10.6?arch=source&distro=noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["8.2.1-1ubuntu3","8.2.1-1ubuntu3.1","8.4.0-2ubuntu1","8.5.0-2ubuntu1","8.5.0-2ubuntu2","8.5.0-2ubuntu8","8.5.0-2ubuntu9","8.5.0-2ubuntu10","8.5.0-2ubuntu10.1","8.5.0-2ubuntu10.2","8.5.0-2ubuntu10.3","8.5.0-2ubuntu10.4","8.5.0-2ubuntu10.5","8.5.0-2ubuntu10.6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"curl","binary_version":"8.5.0-2ubuntu10.6"},{"binary_name":"libcurl3t64-gnutls","binary_version":"8.5.0-2ubuntu10.6"},{"binary_name":"libcurl4-gnutls-dev","binary_version":"8.5.0-2ubuntu10.6"},{"binary_name":"libcurl4-openssl-dev","binary_version":"8.5.0-2ubuntu10.6"},{"binary_name":"libcurl4t64","binary_version":"8.5.0-2ubuntu10.6"}],"priority_reason":"Curl developers have rated this as being low severity"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-10148.json"}},{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.10","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/curl@8.14.1-2ubuntu1?arch=source&distro=questing"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["8.12.1-3ubuntu1","8.13.0-5ubuntu1","8.14.1-1ubuntu2","8.14.1-1ubuntu3","8.14.1-2ubuntu1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"curl","binary_version":"8.14.1-2ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"libcurl3t64-gnutls","binary_version":"8.14.1-2ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"libcurl4-gnutls-dev","binary_version":"8.14.1-2ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"libcurl4-openssl-dev","binary_version":"8.14.1-2ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"libcurl4t64","binary_version":"8.14.1-2ubuntu1"}],"priority_reason":"Curl developers have rated this as being low severity"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-10148.json"}},{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.04","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/curl@8.12.1-3ubuntu1?arch=source&distro=plucky"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["8.9.1-2ubuntu2","8.9.1-2ubuntu3","8.11.0-1ubuntu2","8.11.1-1ubuntu1","8.12.0+git20250209.89ed161+ds-1ubuntu1","8.12.1-2ubuntu1","8.12.1-3ubuntu1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"curl","binary_version":"8.12.1-3ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"libcurl3t64-gnutls","binary_version":"8.12.1-3ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"libcurl4-gnutls-dev","binary_version":"8.12.1-3ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"libcurl4-openssl-dev","binary_version":"8.12.1-3ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"libcurl4t64","binary_version":"8.12.1-3ubuntu1"}],"priority_reason":"Curl developers have rated this as being low severity"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-10148.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-10148"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10148"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2025-10148.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"low"}]}
