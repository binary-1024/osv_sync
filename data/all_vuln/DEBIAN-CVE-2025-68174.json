{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68174","published":"2025-12-16T14:15:49.323Z","modified":"2025-12-17T11:12:05.986772Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-68174"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  amd/amdkfd: enhance kfd process check in switch partition  current switch partition only check if kfd_processes_table is empty. kfd_prcesses_table entry is deleted in kfd_process_notifier_release, but kfd_process tear down is in kfd_process_wq_release.  consider two processes:  Process A (workqueue) -> kfd_process_wq_release -> Access kfd_node member Process B switch partition -> amdgpu_xcp_pre_partition_switch -> amdgpu_amdkfd_device_fini_sw -> kfd_node tear down.  Process A and B may trigger a race as shown in dmesg log.  This patch is to resolve the race by adding an atomic kfd_process counter kfd_processes_count, it increment as create kfd process, decrement as finish kfd_process_wq_release.  v2: Put kfd_processes_count per kfd_dev, move decrement to kfd_process_destroy_pdds and bug fix.
