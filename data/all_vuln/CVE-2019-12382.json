There is an unchecked kstrdup of fwstr, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash). NOTE: The vendor disputes this issues as not being a vulnerability because kstrdup() returning NULL is handled sufficiently and there is no chance for a NULL pointer dereference","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108474"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://cgit.freedesktop.org/drm/drm-misc/commit/?id=9f1f1a2dab38d4ce87a13565cf4dc1b73bef3a5f"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/5/24/843"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-06/msg00039.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-06/msg00040.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-06/msg00048.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/J36BIJTKEPUOZKJNHQBUZA47RQONUKOI/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KLGWJKLMTBBB53D5QLS4HOY2EH246WBE/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/87o93u7d3s.fsf%40intel.com/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://salsa.debian.org/kernel-team/kernel-sec/blob/master/retired/CVE-2019-12382"}],"database_specific":{"isDisputed":true},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
