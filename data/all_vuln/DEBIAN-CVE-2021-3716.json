A MitM attacker could use this flaw to inject a plaintext NBD_OPT_STRUCTURED_REPLY before proxying everything else a client sends to the server, potentially leading the client to terminate the NBD session. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nbdkit","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nbdkit?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.24.1-2","1.26.3-1","1.26.5-1","1.26.6-1","1.26.6-2","1.28.3-1","1.28.3-2","1.28.4-1","1.28.5-1","1.30.0-1","1.30.2-1","1.30.3-1","1.30.4-1","1.30.6-1","1.30.7-1","1.30.8-1","1.30.9-1","1.32.2-1","1.32.2-2","1.32.2-3","1.32.3-1","1.32.4-1","1.32.5-1","1.34.0-1","1.34.1-1","1.34.2-1","1.34.2-10","1.34.2-2","1.34.2-3","1.34.2-4","1.34.2-5","1.34.2-6","1.34.2-7","1.34.2-8","1.34.2-9","1.34.3-1","1.34.4-1","1.36.0-1","1.36.1-1","1.36.2-1","1.36.3-1","1.38.0-1","1.38.1-1","1.38.2-1","1.38.2-2","1.38.3-1","1.40.0-1","1.40.2-1","1.40.2-2","1.40.3-1","1.40.4-1","1.40.4-10","1.40.4-11","1.40.4-2","1.40.4-3","1.40.4-4","1.40.4-5","1.40.4-6","1.40.4-7","1.40.4-8","1.40.4-9","1.40.5-1","1.42.0-1","1.42.1-1","1.42.2-1","1.42.3-1","1.42.4-1","1.42.6-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-3716.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nbdkit","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nbdkit?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.26.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-3716.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nbdkit","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nbdkit?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.26.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-3716.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nbdkit","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nbdkit?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.26.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-3716.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3716"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
