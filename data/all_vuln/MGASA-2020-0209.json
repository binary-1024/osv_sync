  "details": "Updated thunderbird packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nA buffer overflow could occur when parsing and validating SCTP chunks\nin WebRTC. This could have led to memory corruption and a potentially\nexploitable crash (CVE-2020-6831).\n\nA race condition when running shutdown code for Web Worker led to a\nuse-after-free vulnerability. This resulted in a potentially exploitable\ncrash (CVE-2020-12387).\n\nThe 'Copy as cURL' feature of Devtools' network tab did not properly escape\nthe HTTP POST data of a request, which can be controlled by the website.\nIf a user used the 'Copy as cURL' feature and pasted the command into a\nterminal, it could have resulted in the disclosure of local files\n(CVE-2020-12392).\n\nMozilla developers and community members Alexandru Michis, Jason Kratzer,\nphilipp, Ted Campbell, Bas Schouten, Andr\u00e9 Bargull, and Karl Tomlinson\nreported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird ESR 68.7. Some of these\nbugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough\neffort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code\n(CVE-2020-12395).\n\nBy encoding Unicode whitespace characters within the From email header,\nan attacker can spoof the sender email address that Thunderbird displays\n(CVE-2020-12397).\n",
