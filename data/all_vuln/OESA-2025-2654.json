This package includes the components to operate a DNS server.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nUnder certain circumstances, BIND is too lenient when accepting records from answers, allowing an attacker to inject forged data into the cache. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.11.0 through 9.16.50, 9.18.0 through 9.18.39, 9.20.0 through 9.20.13, 9.21.0 through 9.21.12, 9.11.3-S1 through 9.16.50-S1, 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.39-S1, and 9.20.9-S1 through 9.20.13-S1.(CVE-2025-40778)\n\nIn specific circumstances, due to a weakness in the Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) that is used, it is possible for an attacker to predict the source port and query ID that BIND will use. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.0 through 9.16.50, 9.18.0 through 9.18.39, 9.20.0 through 9.20.13, 9.21.0 through 9.21.12, 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.50-S1, 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.39-S1, and 9.20.9-S1 through 9.20.13-S1.(CVE-2025-40780)\n\nQuerying for records within a specially crafted zone containing certain malformed DNSKEY records can lead to CPU exhaustion. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.18.0 through 9.18.39, 9.20.0 through 9.20.13, 9.21.0 through 9.21.12, 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.39-S1, and 9.20.9-S1 through 9.20.13-S1.(CVE-2025-8677)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"bind","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/bind&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.18.21-5.oe2403sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["bind-9.18.21-5.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","bind-chroot-9.18.21-5.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","bind-debuginfo-9.18.21-5.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","bind-debugsource-9.18.21-5.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","bind-devel-9.18.21-5.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","bind-dnssec-utils-9.18.21-5.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","bind-libs-9.18.21-5.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","bind-utils-9.18.21-5.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["bind-dnssec-doc-9.18.21-5.oe2403sp1.noarch.rpm","bind-license-9.18.21-5.oe2403sp1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["bind-9.18.21-5.oe2403sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["bind-9.18.21-5.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","bind-chroot-9.18.21-5.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","bind-debuginfo-9.18.21-5.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","bind-debugsource-9.18.21-5.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","bind-devel-9.18.21-5.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","bind-dnssec-utils-9.18.21-5.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","bind-libs-9.18.21-5.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","bind-utils-9.18.21-5.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2654.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2654"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40778"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40780"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-8677"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
