If an ICMPv4 error packet is received as the first packet on a flow in the to_client direction, it confuses the rule grouping lookup logic.

This can lead to missed detection.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"suricata","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/suricata@3.0-1?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.8-1build1","2.0.9-1","2.0.10-1","2.0.10-2","2.0.11-1","3.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"suricata","binary_version":"3.0-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2016/UBUNTU-CVE-2016-10728.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2016-10728"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/kirillwow/ids_bypass"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/1880"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://suricata-ids.org/2016/09/07/suricata-3-1-2-released/"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-10728"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
