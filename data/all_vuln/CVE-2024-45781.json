When reading a symbolic link's name from a UFS filesystem, grub2 fails to validate the string length taken as an input. The lack of validation may lead to a heap out-of-bounds write, causing data integrity issues and eventually allowing an attacker to circumvent secure boot protections.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:16154"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:6990"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2345857"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-45781"}]}
