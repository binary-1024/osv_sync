The -gp (glyph pattern) command-line option is used directly as the format string for sprintf() with only a single argument supplied. If an attacker provides additional format specifiers, egg-mkfont may read unintended stack values and write the formatted output into generated .egg and .png files, resulting in disclosure of stack-resident memory and pointer values.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"e560eb8da370d86b096d6cb65eafd9ab40879b9a"}]}],"versions":["v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.10","v1.10.11","v1.10.12","v1.10.13","v1.10.14","v1.10.15","v1.10.16","v1.10.2","v1.10.3","v1.10.4","v1.10.4.1","v1.10.5","v1.10.6","v1.10.7","v1.10.8","v1.10.9","v1.8.0","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v1.9.3","v1.9.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22190.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.panda3d.org/"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2026/Jan/11"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/panda3d-egg-mkfont-format-string-information-disclosure"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
