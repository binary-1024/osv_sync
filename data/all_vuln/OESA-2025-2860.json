The main ones are: ld - the GNU linker. as - the GNU assembler. addr2line - Converts addresses into filenames and line numbers. ar - A utility for creating, modifying and extracting from archives. c++filt - Filter to demangle encoded C++ symbols. dlltool - Creates files for building and using DLLs. gold - A new, faster, ELF only linker, still in beta test. gprof - Displays profiling information. nlmconv - Converts object code into an NLM. nm - Lists symbols from object files. objcopy - Copies and translates object files. objdump - Displays information from object files. ranlib - Generates an index to the contents of an archive. readelf - Displays information from any ELF format object file. size - Lists the section sizes of an object or archive file. strings - Lists printable strings from files. trip - Discards symbols. windmc - A Windows compatible message compiler. windres - A compiler for Windows resource files.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability has been found in GNU Binutils 2.45. This impacts the function bfd_elf_gc_record_vtentry of the file bfd/elflink.c of the component Linker. The manipulation leads to out-of-bounds read. Local access is required to approach this attack. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier of the patch is 047435dd988a3975d40c6626a8f739a0b2e154bc. To fix this issue, it is recommended to deploy a patch.(CVE-2025-11412)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"binutils","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/binutils&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.41-28.oe2403sp2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["binutils-2.41-28.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","binutils-debuginfo-2.41-28.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","binutils-debugsource-2.41-28.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","binutils-devel-2.41-28.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","binutils-help-2.41-28.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["binutils-2.41-28.oe2403sp2.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["binutils-2.41-28.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","binutils-debuginfo-2.41-28.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","binutils-debugsource-2.41-28.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","binutils-devel-2.41-28.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","binutils-help-2.41-28.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2860.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2860"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-11412"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
