  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/ttm: Fix a NULL pointer dereference\n\nThe LRU mechanism may look up a resource in the process of being removed\nfrom an object. The locking rules here are a bit unclear but it looks\ncurrently like res->bo assignment is protected by the LRU lock, whereas\nbo->resource is protected by the object lock, while *clearing* of\nbo->resource is also protected by the LRU lock. This means that if\nwe check that bo->resource points to the LRU resource under the LRU\nlock we should be safe.\nSo perform that check before deciding to swap out a bo. That avoids\ndereferencing a NULL bo->resource in ttm_bo_swapout().",
