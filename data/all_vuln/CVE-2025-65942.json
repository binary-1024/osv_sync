In versions from 1.0.0 to before 1.110.23, from 1.111.0 to before 1.122.8, and from 1.123.0 to before 1.129.1, affected versions are vulnerable to DoS attacks because the snappy decoder ignored VictoriaMetrics request size limits allowing malformed blocks to trigger excessive memory use. This could lead to OOM errors and service instability. The fix enforces block-size checks based on MaxRequest limits. This issue has been patched in versions 1.110.23, 1.122.8, and 1.129.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/victoriametrics/victoriametrics","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"51b44afd34d2c9a392d4ebedeeb5b4a7f5beca24"},{"fixed":"6661154b41a26b6fd538fa767c657f119d060410"},{"fixed":"780cb1bf05a341c2fb72aeb6f48a43a73f25bc21"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0-victorialogs","v0.10.0-victorialogs","v0.11.0-victorialogs","v0.12.0-victorialogs","v0.12.1-victorialogs","v0.13.0-victorialogs","v0.14.0-victorialogs","v0.15.0-victorialogs","v0.16.0-victorialogs","v0.17.0-victorialogs","v0.18.0-victorialogs","v0.19.0-victorialogs","v0.2.0-victorialogs","v0.20.0-victorialogs","v0.20.1-victorialogs","v0.20.2-victorialogs","v0.21.0-victorialogs","v0.22.0-victorialogs","v0.23.0-victorialogs","v0.24.0-victorialogs","v0.25.0-victorialogs","v0.26.0-victorialogs","v0.26.1-victorialogs","v0.27.0-victorialogs","v0.27.1-victorialogs","v0.28.0-victorialogs","v0.29.0-victorialogs","v0.3.0-victorialogs","v0.30.0-victorialogs","v0.30.1-victorialogs","v0.31.0-victorialogs","v0.32.0-victorialogs","v0.32.1-victorialogs","v0.33.0-victorialogs","v0.34.0-victorialogs","v0.35.0-victorialogs","v0.36.0-victorialogs","v0.37.0-victorialogs","v0.38.0-victorialogs","v0.39.0-victorialogs","v0.4.0-victorialogs","v0.4.2-victorialogs","v0.40.0-victorialogs","v0.41.0-victorialogs","v0.42.0-victorialogs","v0.5.0-victorialogs","v0.5.1-victorialogs","v0.5.2-victorialogs","v0.6.0-victorialogs","v0.6.1-victorialogs","v0.7.0-victorialogs","v0.8.0-victorialogs","v0.9.0-victorialogs","v0.9.1-victorialogs","v1.0.0-victorialogs","v1.1.0-victorialogs","v1.10.0","v1.10.0-victorialogs","v1.10.1","v1.10.1-victorialogs","v1.100.0","v1.100.0-cluster","v1.100.1","v1.100.1-cluster","v1.101.0","v1.101.0-cluster","v1.102.0","v1.102.0-cluster","v1.102.0-rc1","v1.102.0-rc1-cluster","v1.102.0-rc2","v1.102.0-rc2-cluster","v1.102.1","v1.102.1-cluster","v1.102.10","v1.102.11","v1.102.12","v1.102.13","v1.102.14","v1.102.15","v1.102.16","v1.102.17","v1.102.18","v1.102.19","v1.102.2","v1.102.20","v1.102.21","v1.102.22","v1.102.23","v1.102.24","v1.102.25","v1.102.26","v1.102.3","v1.102.4","v1.102.5","v1.102.6","v1.102.7","v1.102.8","v1.102.9","v1.103.0","v1.103.0-cluster","v1.104.0","v1.104.0-cluster","v1.105.0","v1.105.0-cluster","v1.106.0","v1.106.0-cluster","v1.106.1","v1.106.1-cluster","v1.108.1","v1.108.1-cluster","v1.109.0","v1.109.0-cluster","v1.109.1","v1.109.1-cluster","v1.11.0","v1.11.0-victorialogs","v1.11.1","v1.11.2","v1.11.3","v1.11.4","v1.110.1","v1.110.10","v1.110.11","v1.110.12","v1.110.13","v1.110.14","v1.110.15","v1.110.16","v1.110.17","v1.110.18","v1.110.19","v1.110.2","v1.110.20","v1.110.21","v1.110.22","v1.110.3","v1.110.4","v1.110.5","v1.110.6","v1.110.7","v1.110.8","v1.110.9","v1.111.0","v1.111.0-cluster","v1.113.0","v1.113.0-cluster","v1.114.0","v1.114.0-cluster","v1.115.0","v1.115.0-cluster","v1.117.0","v1.117.0-cluster","v1.117.1","v1.117.1-cluster","v1.118.0","v1.118.0-cluster","v1.119.0","v1.119.0-cluster","v1.12.0","v1.12.0-victorialogs","v1.12.1","v1.12.2","v1.12.3","v1.12.4","v1.12.5","v1.12.6","v1.120.0","v1.120.0-cluster","v1.121.0","v1.121.0-cluster","v1.122.0","v1.122.0-cluster","v1.122.1","v1.122.2","v1.122.3","v1.122.4","v1.122.5","v1.122.6","v1.122.7","v1.123.0","v1.123.0-cluster","v1.124.0","v1.124.0-cluster","v1.125.0","v1.125.0-cluster","v1.125.1","v1.125.1-cluster","v1.126.0","v1.126.0-cluster","v1.127.0","v1.127.0-cluster","v1.128.0","v1.128.0-cluster","v1.129.0","v1.129.0-cluster","v1.13.0","v1.13.0-victorialogs","v1.13.1","v1.14.0","v1.14.0-victorialogs","v1.14.1","v1.14.2","v1.15.0","v1.15.0-victorialogs","v1.15.1","v1.15.2","v1.16.0","v1.16.0-victorialogs","v1.17.0","v1.17.0-victorialogs","v1.17.1","v1.17.2","v1.17.3","v1.17.4","v1.17.5","v1.18.0","v1.18.0-victorialogs","v1.18.1","v1.18.10","v1.18.11","v1.18.3","v1.18.4","v1.18.5","v1.18.6","v1.18.7","v1.18.8","v1.18.9","v1.19.0","v1.19.0-victorialogs","v1.19.1","v1.19.2","v1.19.3","v1.19.4","v1.2.0-victorialogs","v1.2.1","v1.20.0","v1.20.0-victorialogs","v1.20.1","v1.20.2","v1.20.3","v1.20.4","v1.20.5","v1.20.6","v1.20.7","v1.21.0","v1.21.0-victorialogs","v1.21.1","v1.21.2","v1.22.0","v1.22.0-victorialogs","v1.22.1","v1.22.1-victorialogs","v1.22.2","v1.22.2-victorialogs","v1.23.0","v1.23.0-cluster","v1.23.0-victorialogs","v1.23.1","v1.23.1-cluster","v1.23.1-victorialogs","v1.23.2-victorialogs","v1.23.3-victorialogs","v1.24.0","v1.24.0-cluster","v1.24.0-victorialogs","v1.24.1","v1.24.1-cluster","v1.25.0","v1.25.0-cluster","v1.25.1","v1.25.1-cluster","v1.25.2","v1.25.2-cluster","v1.26.0","v1.26.0-cluster","v1.27.0","v1.27.0-cluster","v1.27.1","v1.27.1-cluster","v1.27.2","v1.27.2-cluster","v1.27.3","v1.27.3-cluster","v1.28.0","v1.28.0-beta1","v1.28.0-beta2","v1.28.0-beta3","v1.28.0-beta4","v1.28.0-beta5","v1.28.0-beta6","v1.28.0-cluster","v1.28.0-cluster-beta1","v1.28.0-cluster-beta2","v1.28.0-cluster-beta3","v1.28.0-cluster-beta4","v1.28.0-cluster-beta5","v1.28.0-cluster-beta6","v1.28.1","v1.28.1-cluster","v1.28.2","v1.28.2-c
