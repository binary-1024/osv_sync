It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++ (or other languages, depending on the chosen implementation). Python is also usable as an extension language for applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use scripting or automation interfaces.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nThe  zipfile  module in CPython would not check the validity of the ZIP64 End of Central Directory (EOCD) Locator record offset value. This offset value was not used to locate the ZIP64 EOCD record; instead, the ZIP64 EOCD record was assumed to be the previous record in the ZIP archive. This could be abused to create ZIP archives that are handled differently by the  zipfile  module compared to other ZIP implementations. Remediation maintains this behavior but checks that the offset specified in the ZIP64 EOCD Locator record matches the expected value.(CVE-2025-8291)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python3&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.11.6-16.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python3-3.11.6-16.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","python3-debug-3.11.6-16.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.11.6-16.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.11.6-16.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","python3-devel-3.11.6-16.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","python3-tkinter-3.11.6-16.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","python3-unversioned-command-3.11.6-16.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["python3-help-3.11.6-16.oe2403.noarch.rpm"],"src":["python3-3.11.6-16.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python3-3.11.6-16.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","python3-debug-3.11.6-16.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.11.6-16.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.11.6-16.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","python3-devel-3.11.6-16.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","python3-tkinter-3.11.6-16.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","python3-unversioned-command-3.11.6-16.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2577.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2577"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-8291"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
