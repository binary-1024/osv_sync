  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Handle dml allocation failure to avoid crash\n\n[Why]\nIn the case where a dml allocation fails for any reason, the\ncurrent state's dml contexts would no longer be valid. Then\nsubsequent calls dc_state_copy_internal would shallow copy\ninvalid memory and if the new state was released, a double\nfree would occur.\n\n[How]\nReset dml pointers in new_state to NULL and avoid invalid\npointer\n\n(cherry picked from commit bcafdc61529a48f6f06355d78eb41b3aeda5296c)",
