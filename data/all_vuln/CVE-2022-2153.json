This issue makes it possible for a misbehaving VMM to write to SYNIC/STIMER MSRs, causing a NULL pointer dereference. This flaw allows an unprivileged local attacker on the host to issue specific ioctl calls, causing a kernel oops condition that results in a denial of service.","references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2069736"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/00b5f37189d24ac3ed46cb7f11742094778c46ce"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/7ec37d1cbe17d8189d9562178d8b29167fe1c31a"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/b1e34d325397a33d97d845e312d7cf2a8b646b44"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/10/msg00000.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00001.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/06/22/1"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
