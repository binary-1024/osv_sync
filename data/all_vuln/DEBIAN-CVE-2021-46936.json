  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: fix use-after-free in tw_timer_handler  A real world panic issue was found as follow in Linux 5.4.      BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffde49a863de28     PGD 7e6fe62067 P4D 7e6fe62067 PUD 7e6fe63067 PMD f51e064067 PTE 0     RIP: 0010:tw_timer_handler+0x20/0x40     Call Trace:      <IRQ>      call_timer_fn+0x2b/0x120      run_timer_softirq+0x1ef/0x450      __do_softirq+0x10d/0x2b8      irq_exit+0xc7/0xd0      smp_apic_timer_interrupt+0x68/0x120      apic_timer_interrupt+0xf/0x20  This issue was also reported since 2017 in the thread [1], unfortunately, the issue was still can be reproduced after fixing DCCP.  The ipv4_mib_exit_net is called before tcp_sk_exit_batch when a net namespace is destroyed since tcp_sk_ops is registered befrore ipv4_mib_ops, which means tcp_sk_ops is in the front of ipv4_mib_ops in the list of pernet_list. There will be a use-after-free on net->mib.net_statistics in tw_timer_handler after ipv4_mib_exit_net if there are some inflight time-wait timers.  This bug is not introduced by commit f2bf415cfed7 (\"mib: add net to NET_ADD_STATS_BH\") since the net_statistics is a global variable instead of dynamic allocation and freeing. Actually, commit 61a7e26028b9 (\"mib: put net statistics on struct net\") introduces the bug since it put net statistics on struct net and free it when net namespace is destroyed.  Moving init_ipv4_mibs() to the front of tcp_init() to fix this bug and replace pr_crit() with panic() since continuing is meaningless when init_ipv4_mibs() fails.
