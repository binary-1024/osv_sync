In versions on the 4.x branch prior to version 4.0.5, when parsing compact JWS or JWE input, Go JOSE could use excessive memory. The code used strings.Split(token, &quot;.&quot;) to split JWT tokens, which is vulnerable to excessive memory consumption when processing maliciously crafted tokens with a large number of `.` characters.  An attacker could exploit this by sending numerous malformed tokens, leading to memory exhaustion and a Denial of Service. Version 4.0.5 fixes this issue. As a workaround, applications could pre-validate that payloads passed to Go JOSE do not contain an excessive number of `.` characters.(CVE-2025-27144)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"buildah","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/buildah&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.34.1-7.oe2403sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["buildah-1.34.1-7.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","buildah-debuginfo-1.34.1-7.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","buildah-debugsource-1.34.1-7.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","buildah-tests-1.34.1-7.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["buildah-1.34.1-7.oe2403sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["buildah-1.34.1-7.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","buildah-debuginfo-1.34.1-7.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","buildah-debugsource-1.34.1-7.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","buildah-tests-1.34.1-7.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2176.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2176"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27144"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
