The next execution in the loop will assign self->code_table[11].extends to c, which will give the value of 10. This will make the loop run infinitely. This bug can, for example, be triggered by calling this function with a GIF image with LZW compression that is crafted in a special way.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gdk-pixbuf","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:20.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/gdk-pixbuf@2.40.0+dfsg-3ubuntu0.1?arch=source&distro=focal"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.40.0+dfsg-3ubuntu0.1"}]}],"versions":["2.40.0+dfsg-1build1","2.40.0+dfsg-1ubuntu1","2.40.0+dfsg-2","2.40.0+dfsg-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"gir1.2-gdkpixbuf-2.0","binary_version":"2.40.0+dfsg-3ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0","binary_version":"2.40.0+dfsg-3ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"libgdk-pixbuf2.0-bin","binary_version":"2.40.0+dfsg-3ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"libgdk-pixbuf2.0-common","binary_version":"2.40.0+dfsg-3ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev","binary_version":"2.40.0+dfsg-3ubuntu0.1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2020/UBUNTU-CVE-2020-29385.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-29385"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://mail.gnome.org/archives/distributor-list/2020-December/msg00000.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4663-1"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-29385"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
