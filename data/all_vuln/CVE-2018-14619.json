The \"null skcipher\" was being dropped when each af_alg_ctx was freed instead of when the aead_tfm was freed. This can cause the null skcipher to be freed while it is still in use leading to a local user being able to crash the system or possibly escalate privileges.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105200"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2948"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2018-14619"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=b32a7dc8aef1882fbf983eb354837488cc9d54dc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2018-0013"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
