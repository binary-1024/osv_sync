There is a blocking operation when a task is in !TASK_RUNNING. In dvb_frontend_get_event, wait_event_interruptible is called; the condition is dvb_frontend_test_event(fepriv,events). In dvb_frontend_test_event, down(&fepriv->sem) is called. However, wait_event_interruptible would put the process to sleep, and down(&fepriv->sem) may block the process.","references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/07/msg00030.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00027.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230929-0003/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5448"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5480"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=b8c75e4a1b325ea0a9433fa8834be97b5836b946"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6HIEOLEOURP4BJZMIL7UGGPYRRB44UDN/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AOATNX5UFL7V7W2QDIQKOHFFHYKWFP4W/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lore.kernel.org/all/CA+UBctCu7fXn4q41O_3=id1+OdyQ85tZY1x+TkT-6OVBL6KAUw%40mail.gmail.com/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
