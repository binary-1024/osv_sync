NOTE: third-party analysis reports \"This is not a security issue in my view. The conversion surely is truncating the double into a long value, but there is no impact as the value is one of the RGB components.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libcroco","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libcroco?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.6.13-r1"}]}],"versions":["0.6.11-r0","0.6.11-r1","0.6.12-r0","0.6.12-r1","0.6.13-r0","0.6.2-r0","0.6.2-r1","0.6.2-r2","0.6.2-r3","0.6.2-r4","0.6.2-r5","0.6.3-r0","0.6.4-r0","0.6.4-r1","0.6.5-r0","0.6.8-r0","0.6.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-7961.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libcroco","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libcroco?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.6.13-r1"}]}],"versions":["0.6.11-r0","0.6.11-r1","0.6.12-r0","0.6.12-r1","0.6.13-r0","0.6.2-r0","0.6.2-r1","0.6.2-r2","0.6.2-r3","0.6.2-r4","0.6.2-r5","0.6.3-r0","0.6.4-r0","0.6.4-r1","0.6.5-r0","0.6.8-r0","0.6.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-7961.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libcroco","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.7","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libcroco?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.6.12-r1"}]}],"versions":["0.6.11-r0","0.6.11-r1","0.6.12-r0","0.6.2-r0","0.6.2-r1","0.6.2-r2","0.6.2-r3","0.6.2-r4","0.6.2-r5","0.6.3-r0","0.6.4-r0","0.6.4-r1","0.6.5-r0","0.6.8-r0","0.6.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-7961.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libcroco","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.8","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libcroco?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.6.12-r2"}]}],"versions":["0.6.11-r0","0.6.11-r1","0.6.12-r0","0.6.12-r1","0.6.2-r0","0.6.2-r1","0.6.2-r2","0.6.2-r3","0.6.2-r4","0.6.2-r5","0.6.3-r0","0.6.4-r0","0.6.4-r1","0.6.5-r0","0.6.8-r0","0.6.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-7961.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libcroco","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.9","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libcroco?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.6.12-r2"}]}],"versions":["0.6.11-r0","0.6.11-r1","0.6.12-r0","0.6.12-r1","0.6.2-r0","0.6.2-r1","0.6.2-r2","0.6.2-r3","0.6.2-r4","0.6.2-r5","0.6.3-r0","0.6.4-r0","0.6.4-r1","0.6.5-r0","0.6.8-r0","0.6.9-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2017-7961.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2017-7961"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
