  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: bridge: replace physindev with physinif in nf_bridge_info  An skb can be added to a neigh->arp_queue while waiting for an arp reply. Where original skb's skb->dev can be different to neigh's neigh->dev. For instance in case of bridging dnated skb from one veth to another, the skb would be added to a neigh->arp_queue of the bridge.  As skb->dev can be reset back to nf_bridge->physindev and used, and as there is no explicit mechanism that prevents this physindev from been freed under us (for instance neigh_flush_dev doesn't cleanup skbs from different device's neigh queue) we can crash on e.g. this stack:  arp_process   neigh_update     skb = __skb_dequeue(&neigh->arp_queue)       neigh_resolve_output(..., skb)         ...           br_nf_dev_xmit             br_nf_pre_routing_finish_bridge_slow               skb->dev = nf_bridge->physindev               br_handle_frame_finish  Let's use plain ifindex instead of net_device link. To peek into the original net_device we will use dev_get_by_index_rcu(). Thus either we get device and are safe to use it or we don't get it and drop skb.",
