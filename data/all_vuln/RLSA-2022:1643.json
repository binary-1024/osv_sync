  "details": "XML-RPC is a remote procedure call (RPC) protocol that uses XML to encode its calls and HTTP as a transport mechanism. The xmlrpc-c packages provide a network protocol to allow a client program to make a simple RPC (remote procedure call) over the Internet. It converts an RPC into an XML document, sends it to a remote server using HTTP, and gets back the response in XML.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* expat: Malformed 2- and 3-byte UTF-8 sequences can lead to arbitrary code execution (CVE-2022-25235)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.",
