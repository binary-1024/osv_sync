  "details": "Versions of `jquery.json-viewer` prior to 1.3.0 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The package insufficiently sanitizes user input when creating links, and concatenates the user input in an `<a>` tag. This allows attackers to create malicious links with JSON payloads such as: \n```\n{\n  \"foo\": \"https://bar.com\\\" onmouseover=alert('xss') \\\"\"\n}\n```\n\nThis may lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution in a victim's browser.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 1.3.0 or later.",
