{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-24803","published":"2025-02-05T18:41:30.040Z","modified":"2025-12-15T14:34:31.249003Z","aliases":["GHSA-cxqq-w3x5-7ph3"],"summary":"Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in MobSF","details":"Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is an automated, all-in-one mobile application (Android/iOS/Windows) pen-testing, malware analysis and security assessment framework. According to Apple's documentation for bundle ID's, it must contain only alphanumeric characters (A–Z, a–z, and 0–9), hyphens (-), and periods (.). However, an attacker can manually modify this value in the `Info.plist` file and add special characters to the `<key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>` value. The `dynamic_analysis.html` file does not sanitize the received bundle value from Corellium and as a result, it is possible to break the HTML context and achieve Stored XSS. This issue has been addressed in version 4.3.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-24803.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/cfbundleidentifier"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/24xxx/CVE-2025-24803.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/commit/05206e72cae35b311615a70e51e1a946955c5e83"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/security/advisories/GHSA-cxqq-w3x5-7ph3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24803"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/24xxx/CVE-2025-24803.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
