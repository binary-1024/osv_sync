This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-257685302References: Upstream kernel(CVE-2023-20938)\r\n\r\nThere is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel which can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. To reach the vulnerability kernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLS or CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCP has to be configured, but the operation does not require any privilege. There is a use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_data of a struct inet_connection_sock. When CONFIG_TLS is enabled, user can install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this socket is disconnected and reused as a listener. If a new socket is created from the listener, the context is inherited and vulnerable. The setsockopt TCP_ULP operation does not require any privilege. We recommend upgrading past commit 2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c(CVE-2023-0461)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel 6.0.8, there is an out-of-bounds read in ntfs_attr_find in fs/ntfs/attrib.c.(CVE-2023-26607)\r\n\r\nA flaw in the Linux Kernel found. The tls_is_tx_ready() incorrectly checks for list emptiness, potentially accessing a type confused entry to the list_head, leaking the last byte of the confused field that overlaps with rec-&gt;tx_ready.\r\n\r\n\nReference:\nhttps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=ffe2a22562444720b05bdfeb999c03e810d84cbb(CVE-2023-1075)\r\n\r\nA flaw found in the Linux Kernel in RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) protocol. The rds_rm_zerocopy_callback() uses list_entry() on the head of a list causing a type confusion. Local user can trigger this with rds_message_put(). Type confusion leads to `struct rds_msg_zcopy_info *info` actually points to something else that is potentially controlled by local user.\nIt is known how to trigger this, which causes an OOB access, and a lock corruption.\r\n\r\nReference:\nhttps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=f753a68980cf4b59a80fe677619da2b1804f526d(CVE-2023-1078)\r\n\r\nA flaw found in the Linux Kernel. The tun/tap sockets have their socket UID hardcoded to 0 due to a type confusion in their initialization function.\nWhile it will be often correct, as tuntap devices require CAP_NET_ADMIN, it may not always be the case, e.g., a non-root user only having that capability.\nThis would make tun/tap sockets being incorrectly treated in filtering/routing decisions, possibly bypassing network filters.\r\n\r\nReferences:\nhttps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=66b2c338adce580dfce2199591e65e2bab889cff\nhttps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=a096ccca6e503a5c575717ff8a36ace27510ab0a(CVE-2023-1076)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel before 5.17, an error path in dwc3_qcom_acpi_register_core in drivers/usb/dwc3/dwc3-qcom.c lacks certain platform_device_put and kfree calls.(CVE-2023-22995)\r\n\r\nA flaw use after free in the Linux kernel integrated infrared receiver/transceiver driver was found in the way user detaching rc device.
