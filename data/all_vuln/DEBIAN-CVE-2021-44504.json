Using crafted input, an attacker can cause a size variable, stored as an signed int, to equal an extremely large value, which is interpreted as a negative value during a check. This value is then used in a memcpy call on the stack, causing a memory segmentation fault.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"fis-gtm","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/fis-gtm?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.3-014-3","7.0-002-1","7.0-002-2","7.0-002-3","7.0-004-1","7.0-004-2","7.0-005-1","7.0-005-2","7.0-005-2.1","7.1-005-1","7.1-006-1","7.1-008-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-44504.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fis-gtm","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/fis-gtm?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["7.0-005-1","7.0-005-2","7.0-005-2.1","7.1-005-1","7.1-006-1","7.1-008-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-44504.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fis-gtm","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/fis-gtm?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.1-006-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-44504.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fis-gtm","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/fis-gtm?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.1-006-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-44504.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-44504"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
