{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68212","published":"2025-12-16T13:57:08.327Z","modified":"2026-01-17T19:51:44.362678Z","summary":"fs: Fix uninitialized 'offp' in statmount_string()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs: Fix uninitialized 'offp' in statmount_string()\n\nIn statmount_string(), most flags assign an output offset pointer (offp)\nwhich is later updated with the string offset. However, the\nSTATMOUNT_MNT_UIDMAP and STATMOUNT_MNT_GIDMAP cases directly set the\nstruct fields instead of using offp. This leaves offp uninitialized,\nleading to a possible uninitialized dereference when *offp is updated.\n\nFix it by assigning offp for UIDMAP and GIDMAP as well, keeping the code\npath consistent.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"37c4a9590e1efcae7749682239fc22a330d2d325"},{"fixed":"acfde9400e611c8d2668f1c70053c4a1d6ecfc36"},{"fixed":"0778ac7df5137d5041783fadfc201f8fd55a1d9b"}]}],"versions":["v6.14","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.17.8","v6.17.9","v6.18-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68212.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.15.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68212.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0778ac7df5137d5041783fadfc201f8fd55a1d9b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/acfde9400e611c8d2668f1c70053c4a1d6ecfc36"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68212.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68212"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68212.json"}}
