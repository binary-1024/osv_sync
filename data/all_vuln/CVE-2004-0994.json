NOTE: CVE-2004-0994 and CVE-2004-1095 identify sets of bugs that only partially overlap, despite having the same developer.  Therefore, they should be regarded as distinct.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.debian.org/security/2004/dsa-614"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=110297198402077&w=2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://rus.members.beeb.net/xzgv-0.8-integer-overflow-fix.diff"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/18454"}]}
