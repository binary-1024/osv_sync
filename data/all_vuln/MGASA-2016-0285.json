  "summary": "Updated curl packages fix security vulnerability",
  "details": "libcurl before 7.50.1 would attempt to resume a TLS session even if the\nclient certificate had changed. That is unacceptable since a server by\nspecification is allowed to skip the client certificate check on resume,\nand may instead use the old identity which was established by the previous\ncertificate (or no certificate) (CVE-2016-5419).\n\nIn libcurl before 7.50.1, when using a client certificate for a connection\nthat was then put into the connection pool, that connection could then\nwrongly get reused in a subsequent request to that same server. This\nmistakenly using the wrong connection could lead to applications sending\nrequests to the wrong realms of the server using authentication that it\nwasn't supposed to have for those operations (CVE-2016-5420).\n\nlibcurl before 7.50.1 is vulnerable to a use-after-free flaw in\ncurl_easy_perform() (CVE-2016-5421).\n",
