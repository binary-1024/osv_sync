{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-71162","published":"2026-01-25T15:15:53.947Z","modified":"2026-01-26T11:16:06.973910Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-71162"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dmaengine: tegra-adma: Fix use-after-free  A use-after-free bug exists in the Tegra ADMA driver when audio streams are terminated, particularly during XRUN conditions. The issue occurs when the DMA buffer is freed by tegra_adma_terminate_all() before the vchan completion tasklet finishes accessing it.  The race condition follows this sequence:    1. DMA transfer completes, triggering an interrupt that schedules the      completion tasklet (tasklet has not executed yet)   2. Audio playback stops, calling tegra_adma_terminate_all() which      frees the DMA buffer memory via kfree()   3. The scheduled tasklet finally executes, calling vchan_complete()      which attempts to access the already-freed memory  Since tasklets can execute at any time after being scheduled, there is no guarantee that the buffer will remain valid when vchan_complete() runs.  Fix this by properly synchronizing the virtual channel completion:  - Calling vchan_terminate_vdesc() in tegra_adma_stop() to mark the    descriptors as terminated instead of freeing the descriptor.  - Add the callback tegra_adma_synchronize() that calls    vchan_synchronize() which kills any pending tasklets and frees any    terminated descriptors.
