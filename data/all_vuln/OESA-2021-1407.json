The Wi-Fi implementation does not verify the Message Integrity Check (authenticity) of fragmented TKIP frames. An adversary can abuse this to inject and possibly decrypt packets in WPA or WPA2 networks that support the TKIP data-confidentiality protocol.(CVE-2020-26141)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered on Samsung Galaxy S3 i9305 4.4.4 devices. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations accept second (or subsequent) broadcast fragments even when sent in plaintext and process them as full unfragmented frames. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets independent of the network configuration.(CVE-2020-26145)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in aspeed_lpc_ctrl_mmap in drivers/soc/aspeed/aspeed-lpc-ctrl.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.6. Local attackers able to access the Aspeed LPC control interface could overwrite memory in the kernel and potentially execute privileges, aka CID-b49a0e69a7b1. This occurs because a certain comparison uses values that are not memory sizes.(CVE-2021-42252)\n\nThe firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt mishandles bounds checking.(CVE-2021-42739)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kernel","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/kernel&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["perf-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["kernel-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["bpftool-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1407.json"}},{"package":{"name":"kernel","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/kernel&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["perf-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["kernel-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["bpftool-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2110.8.0.0120.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1407.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1407"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26141"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26145"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42252"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42739"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
