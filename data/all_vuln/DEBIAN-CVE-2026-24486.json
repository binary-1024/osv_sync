Prior to version 0.0.22, a Path Traversal vulnerability exists when using non-default configuration options `UPLOAD_DIR` and `UPLOAD_KEEP_FILENAME=True`. An attacker can write uploaded files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem by crafting a malicious filename. Users should upgrade to version 0.0.22 to receive a patch or, as a workaround, avoid using `UPLOAD_KEEP_FILENAME=True` in project configurations.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-multipart","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-multipart?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.0.17-1","0.0.17-2","0.0.17-3","0.0.17-4","0.0.17-5","0.0.20-1","0.0.5-2","0.0.5-3","0.0.6-1","0.0.9-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-24486.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-multipart","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-multipart?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.0.17-1","0.0.17-2","0.0.17-3","0.0.17-4","0.0.17-5","0.0.20-1","0.0.5-3","0.0.6-1","0.0.9-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-24486.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-multipart","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-multipart?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.0.20-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-24486.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-multipart","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-multipart?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.0.20-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-24486.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2026-24486"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L"}]}
