  "details": "Updated squid packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nDue to improper input validation Squid is vulnerable to an HTTP Request\nSmuggling attack. This problem allows a trusted client to perform HTTP\nRequest Smuggling and access services otherwise forbidden by Squid\nsecurity controls (CVE-2020-25097).\n\nJoshua Rogers discovered that Squid incorrectly handled requests with the\nurn: scheme. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to causeSquid\nto consume resources, leading to a denial of service (CVE-2021-28651).\n\nJoshua Rogers discovered that Squid incorrectly handled requests to the Cache\nManager API. A remote attacker with access privileges could possibly use this\nissue to cause Squid to consume resources, leading to a denial of service\n(CVE-2021-28652).\n\nJoshua Rogers discovered that Squid incorrectly handled certain response\nheaders. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Squid to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service (CVE-2021-28662).\n\nJoshua Rogers discovered that Squid incorrectly handled range request\nprocessing. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Squid to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service (CVE-2021-31806, CVE-2021-31807,\nCVE-2021-31808).\n\nJoshua Rogers discovered that Squid incorrectly handled certain HTTP\nresponses. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Squid to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service (CVE-2021-33620).\n\nThe squid package has been updated to version 4.15, fixing theese issues and\nother bugs.\n",
