  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  macvlan: add forgotten nla_policy for IFLA_MACVLAN_BC_CUTOFF  The previous commit 954d1fa1ac93 (\"macvlan: Add netlink attribute for broadcast cutoff\") added one additional attribute named IFLA_MACVLAN_BC_CUTOFF to allow broadcast cutfoff.  However, it forgot to describe the nla_policy at macvlan_policy (drivers/net/macvlan.c). Hence, this suppose NLA_S32 (4 bytes) integer can be faked as empty (0 bytes) by a malicious user, which could leads to OOB in heap just like CVE-2023-3773.  To fix it, this commit just completes the nla_policy description for IFLA_MACVLAN_BC_CUTOFF. This enforces the length check and avoids the potential OOB read.",
