This happened when a server responded to a ClientHello containing psk_dhe_ke without a key_share extension. The re-use of an authenticated PSK connection that on the clients side unexpectedly did not have PFS, reduces the security of the connection.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wolfssl","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/wolfssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.6.0+p1-0+deb11u1","4.6.0+p1-0+deb11u2","4.6.0-3","5.0.0-1","5.0.0-1~bpo11+1","5.1.1-1","5.1.1-1~bpo11+1","5.2.0-1","5.2.0-2","5.2.0-2~bpo11+1","5.5.3-1","5.5.3-2","5.5.3-3","5.5.3-3~bpo11+1","5.5.4-1","5.5.4-2","5.5.4-2.1","5.5.4-2~bpo11+1","5.6.4-1","5.6.4-2","5.6.6-1","5.6.6-1.1","5.6.6-1.2","5.6.6-1.3","5.6.6-1.3~exp1","5.7.0-0.1","5.7.0-0.2","5.7.0-0.3","5.7.2-0.1","5.7.2-0.2","5.7.2-0.3","5.7.2-0.4","5.8.2-1","5.8.2-1.1","5.8.2-1.2","5.8.4-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-11935.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wolfssl","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/wolfssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.5.4-2","5.5.4-2+deb12u1","5.5.4-2+deb12u2","5.5.4-2.1","5.6.4-1","5.6.4-2","5.6.6-1","5.6.6-1.1","5.6.6-1.2","5.6.6-1.3","5.6.6-1.3~exp1","5.7.0-0.1","5.7.0-0.2","5.7.0-0.3","5.7.2-0.1","5.7.2-0.2","5.7.2-0.3","5.7.2-0.4","5.8.2-1","5.8.2-1.1","5.8.2-1.2","5.8.4-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-11935.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wolfssl","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/wolfssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.7.2-0.1","5.7.2-0.1+deb13u1","5.7.2-0.2","5.7.2-0.3","5.7.2-0.4","5.8.2-1","5.8.2-1.1","5.8.2-1.2","5.8.4-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-11935.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wolfssl","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/wolfssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.7.2-0.1","5.7.2-0.2","5.7.2-0.3","5.7.2-0.4","5.8.2-1","5.8.2-1.1","5.8.2-1.2","5.8.4-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-11935.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-11935"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
