NOTE: the discoverer and vendor disagree on whether Moodle customers have a reasonable expectation that anyone authenticated as a Teacher can be trusted with the ability to add arbitrary JavaScript (this ability is not documented on Moodle's Teacher_role page). Because the vendor has this expectation, they have stated \"this report has been closed as a false positive, and not a bug.\"","affected":[{"package":{"name":"moodle","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/moodle@3.0.3+dfsg-0ubuntu1?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.7.9+dfsg-1","2.7.10+dfsg-1","2.7.11+dfsg-1","2.7.11+dfsg-2","2.7.12+dfsg-1","3.0.3+dfsg-0ubuntu1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"moodle","binary_version":"3.0.3+dfsg-0ubuntu1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2019/UBUNTU-CVE-2019-18210.json"}},{"package":{"name":"moodle","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/moodle@3.0.3+dfsg-0ubuntu1?arch=source&distro=bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.0.3+dfsg-0ubuntu1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"moodle","binary_version":"3.0.3+dfsg-0ubuntu1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2019/UBUNTU-CVE-2019-18210.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-18210"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/Teacher_role"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://gist.github.com/Danbardo/4a6b0fe8cb21ec6d7c54e6ac951bdb0a"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-18210"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"low"}]}
