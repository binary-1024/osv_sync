Prior to version 4.2.0, the sigstore-python OAuth authentication flow is susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery. `_OAuthSession` creates a unique \"state\" and sends it as a parameter in the authentication request but the \"state\" in the server response seems not not be cross-checked with this value. Version 4.2.0 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"94818e43224db2aed78f3cf066a561cf95982051"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1-pre.1","v0.0.1-pre.3","v0.1.0","v0.10.0","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.6.5","v0.6.6","v0.6.7","v0.6.8","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.9.0","v1.0.0","v1.0.0rc1","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.1rc1","v1.1.2","v1.1.2rc1","v2.0.0","v2.0.0rc1","v2.0.0rc2","v2.0.0rc3","v2.0.1","v2.1.0","v3.0.0","v3.0.0rc1","v3.0.0rc2","v3.1.0","v3.2.0","v3.3.0","v3.4.0","v3.5.0","v3.5.1","v3.6.0","v3.6.1","v3.6.2","v4.0.0","v4.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24408.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24408.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/commit/5e77497fe8f0b202bdd118949074ec2f20da69aa"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/releases/tag/v4.2.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/security/advisories/GHSA-hm8f-75xx-w2vr"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24408"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-352"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24408.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N"}]}
