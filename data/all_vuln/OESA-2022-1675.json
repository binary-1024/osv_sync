However, several TLS and SSH settings were left out from the configuration match checks, making them match too easily.(CVE-2022-27782)\n\nA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs due to an erroneous function. A malicious server could make curl within Network Security Services (NSS) get stuck in a never-ending busy loop when trying to retrieve that information.
