  "details": "A vulnerability in the endpoint software of Cisco AMP for Endpoints and Clam\nAntiVirus could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause the running\nsoftware to delete arbitrary files on the system. The vulnerability is due to a\nrace condition that could occur when scanning malicious files. An attacker with\nlocal shell access could exploit this vulnerability by executing a script that\ncould trigger the race condition. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\nto delete arbitrary files on the system that the attacker would not normally\nhave privileges to delete, producing system instability or causing the endpoint\nsoftware to stop working. (CVE-2020-3350)\n\nA vulnerability in the EGG archive parsing module in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV)\nSoftware versions 0.102.0 - 0.102.3 could allow an unauthenticated, remote\nattacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The\nvulnerability is due to a null pointer dereference. An attacker could exploit\nthis vulnerability by sending a crafted EGG file to an affected device. An\nexploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process crash,\nresulting in a denial of service condition. (CVE-2020-3481)\n",
