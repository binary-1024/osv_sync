  "details": "keepalived before version 2.0.9 didn't check for pathnames with symlinks\nwhen writing data to a temporary file upon a call to PrintData or\nPrintStats. This allowed local users to overwrite arbitrary files if\nfs.protected_symlinks is set to 0, as demonstrated by a symlink from\n/tmp/keepalived.data or /tmp/keepalived.stats to /etc/passwd\n(CVE-2018-19044).\n\nkeepalived before version 2.0.9 used mode 0666 when creating new\ntemporary files upon a call to PrintData or PrintStats, potentially\nleaking sensitive information (CVE-2018-19045).\n\nkeepalived before version 2.0.10 didn't check for existing plain files\nwhen writing data to a temporary file upon a call to PrintData or\nPrintStats. If a local attacker had previously created a file with the\nexpected name (e.g., /tmp/keepalived.data or /tmp/keepalived.stats),\nwith read access for the attacker and write access for the keepalived\nprocess, then this potentially leaked sensitive information\n(CVE-2018-19046).\n\nkeepalived before version 2.0.9 has a heap-based buffer overflow when\nparsing HTTP status codes resulting in DoS or possibly unspecified other\nimpact, because extract_status_code in lib/html.c has no validation of\nthe status code and instead writes an unlimited amount of data to the\nheap (CVE-2018-19115).\n",
