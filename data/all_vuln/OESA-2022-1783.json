  "details": "The Go Programming Language\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nWhen httputil.ReverseProxy.ServeHTTP was called with a Request.Header map containing a nil value for the X-Forwarded-For header, ReverseProxy would set the client IP as the value of the X-Forwarded-For header, contrary to its documentation. In the more usual case where a Director function set the X-Forwarded-For header value to nil, ReverseProxy would leave the header unmodified as expected.(CVE-2022-32148)\n\nCalling Decoder.Decode on a message which contains deeply nested structures can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.(CVE-2022-30635)\n\nInfinite loop in Read in crypto/rand before Go 1.17.11 and Go 1.18.3 on Windows allows attacker to cause an indefinite hang by passing a buffer larger than 1 &lt;&lt; 32 - 1 bytes. (CVE-2022-30634)\n\nCalling Unmarshal on a XML document into a Go struct which has a nested field that uses the any field tag can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.(CVE-2022-30633)\n\nCalling Glob on a path which contains a large number of path separators can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.(CVE-2022-30632)\n\nCalling Reader.Read on an archive containing a large number of concatenated 0-length compressed files can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.(CVE-2022-30631)\n\nAs required by RFC 8446, section 4.6.1, ticket_age_add now holds arandom 32-bit value. Before this change, this value was always setto 0.(CVE-2022-30629)\n\nCalling Decoder.Skip when parsing a deeply nested XML document can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.(CVE-2022-28131)\n\nCalling any of the Parse functions on Go source code which contains deeply nested types or declarations can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.(CVE-2022-1962)\n\nThe HTTP/1 client accepted some invalid Transfer-Encoding headers as indicating a chunked encoding. This could potentially allow for request smuggling, but only if combined with an intermediate server that also improperly failed to reject the header as invalid.(CVE-2022-1705)",
