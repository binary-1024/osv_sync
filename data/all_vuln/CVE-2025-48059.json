In com.powsybl:powsybl-iidm-criteria versions 6.3.0 to before 6.7.2 and com.powsybl:powsybl-contingency-api versions 5.0.0 to before 6.3.0, there is a a potential polynomial Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the RegexCriterion class. This class compiles and evaluates an unvalidated, user-supplied regular expression against the identifier of an Identifiable object via Pattern.compile(regex).matcher(id).find(). If successfully exploited, a malicious actor can cause significant CPU exhaustion through repeated or recursive filter(...) calls — especially if performed over large network models or filtering operations.
