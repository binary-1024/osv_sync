  "details": "The Linux Kernel, the operating system core itself.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nIn binder_transaction_buffer_release of binder.c, there is a possible use after free due to improper input validation. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-257685302References: Upstream kernel(CVE-2023-20938)\r\n\r\nThere is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel which can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. To reach the vulnerability kernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLS or CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCP has to be configured, but the operation does not require any privilege. There is a use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_data of a struct inet_connection_sock. When CONFIG_TLS is enabled, user can install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this socket is disconnected and reused as a listener. If a new socket is created from the listener, the context is inherited and vulnerable. The setsockopt TCP_ULP operation does not require any privilege. We recommend upgrading past commit 2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c(CVE-2023-0461)\r\n\r\nA flaw in the Linux Kernel found. Fail if no bound addresses can be used for a given scope. A type confusion can happen in inet_diag_msg_sctpasoc_fill() in net/sctp/diag.c, which uses a type confused pointer to return information to userspace when issuing a list_entry() on asoc-&gt;base.bind_addr.address_list.next when the list is empty.\r\n\r\nReferences:\nhttps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=458e279f861d3f61796894cd158b780765a1569f\nhttps://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/01/23/1(CVE-2023-1074)\r\n\r\nA flaw found in the Linux Kernel in RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) protocol. The rds_rm_zerocopy_callback() uses list_entry() on the head of a list causing a type confusion. Local user can trigger this with rds_message_put(). Type confusion leads to `struct rds_msg_zcopy_info *info` actually points to something else that is potentially controlled by local user.\nIt is known how to trigger this, which causes an OOB access, and a lock corruption.\r\n\r\nReference:\nhttps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=f753a68980cf4b59a80fe677619da2b1804f526d(CVE-2023-1078)\r\n\r\nA flaw found in the Linux Kernel. The tun/tap sockets have their socket UID hardcoded to 0 due to a type confusion in their initialization function.\nWhile it will be often correct, as tuntap devices require CAP_NET_ADMIN, it may not always be the case, e.g., a non-root user only having that capability.\nThis would make tun/tap sockets being incorrectly treated in filtering/routing decisions, possibly bypassing network filters.\r\n\r\nReferences:\nhttps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=66b2c338adce580dfce2199591e65e2bab889cff\nhttps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=a096ccca6e503a5c575717ff8a36ace27510ab0a(CVE-2023-1076)\r\n\r\nA flaw use after free in the Linux kernel integrated infrared receiver/transceiver driver was found in the way user detaching rc device. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2023-1118)\n\nIn the Linux kernel before 6.1.13, there is a double free in net/mpls/af_mpls.c upon an allocation failure (for registering the sysctl table under a new location) during the renaming of a device.(CVE-2023-26545)",
