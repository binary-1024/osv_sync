  "summary": "Updated tomcat packages fix security vulnerabilities",
  "details": "When responding to new h2c connection requests, Apache Tomcat versions \n9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.41 could duplicate request headers and a limited amount of\nrequest body from one request to another meaning user A and user B could both\nsee the results of user A's request (CVE-2021-25122).\n\nThe fix for CVE-2020-9484 was incomplete. When using Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to\n9.0.41 with a configuration edge case that was highly unlikely to be used, the\nTomcat instance was still vulnerable to CVE-2020-9494 (CVE-2021-25329).\n",
