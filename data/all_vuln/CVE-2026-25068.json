{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-25068","published":"2026-01-29T20:16:10.623Z","modified":"2026-01-30T22:51:12.434554Z","details":"alsa-lib versions 1.2.2 up to and including 1.2.15.2, prior to commit 5f7fe33, contain a heap-based buffer overflow in the topology mixer control decoder. The tplg_decode_control_mixer1() function reads the num_channels field from untrusted .tplg data and uses it as a loop bound without validating it against the fixed-size channel array (SND_TPLG_MAX_CHAN). A crafted topology file with an excessive num_channels value can cause out-of-bounds heap writes, leading to a crash.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/alsa-project/alsa-lib","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5f7fe33002d2d98d84f72e381ec2cccc0d5d3d40"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.10","v1.0.10rc1","v1.0.10rc2","v1.0.10rc3","v1.0.11","v1.0.11rc1","v1.0.11rc2","v1.0.11rc3","v1.0.11rc4","v1.0.11rc5","v1.0.12","v1.0.12rc1","v1.0.12rc2","v1.0.13","v1.0.13rc1","v1.0.13rc2","v1.0.13rc3","v1.0.14","v1.0.14a","v1.0.14rc1","v1.0.14rc2","v1.0.14rc3","v1.0.14rc4","v1.0.15","v1.0.15rc1","v1.0.15rc2","v1.0.15rc3","v1.0.16","v1.0.16rc1","v1.0.16rc2","v1.0.17","v1.0.17a","v1.0.17rc1","v1.0.17rc2","v1.0.18","v1.0.18rc3","v1.0.19","v1.0.20","v1.0.21","v1.0.21a","v1.0.22","v1.0.23","v1.0.24","v1.0.24.1","v1.0.25","v1.0.26","v1.0.27","v1.0.27.1","v1.0.27.2","v1.0.28","v1.0.29","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v1.0.7","v1.0.8","v1.0.9","v1.0.9rc1","v1.0.9rc2","v1.0.9rc3","v1.0.9rc4","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.4.1","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.1.7","v1.1.8","v1.1.9","v1.2.1","v1.2.1.1","v1.2.1.2","v1.2.10","v1.2.11","v1.2.12","v1.2.13","v1.2.14","v1.2.15","v1.2.15.1","v1.2.15.2","v1.2.15.3","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.3.1","v1.2.3.2","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.6.1","v1.2.7","v1.2.7.1","v1.2.7.2","v1.2.8","v1.2.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-25068.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["40889492823950341381219997890138818637","215537673880048521820366870348777685505","319064719151019657717276530282089549044","301499185625432265915833169725067162728"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2026-25068-04f3a047","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/alsa-project/alsa-lib/commit/5f7fe33002d2d98d84f72e381ec2cccc0d5d3d40","target":{"file":"src/topology/ctl.c"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"207084074088684355095339922975343511881","length":2444},"id":"CVE-2026-25068-0cbbd58c","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/alsa-project/alsa-lib/commit/5f7fe33002d2d98d84f72e381ec2cccc0d5d3d40","target":{"file":"src/topology/ctl.c","function":"tplg_decode_control_mixer1"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/alsa-lib-topology-decoder-heap-based-buffer-overflow"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/alsa-project/alsa-lib/commit/5f7fe33002d2d98d84f72e381ec2cccc0d5d3d40"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
