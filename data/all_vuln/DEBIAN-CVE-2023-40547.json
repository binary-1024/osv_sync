The Shim boot support trusts attacker-controlled values when parsing an HTTP response. This flaw allows an attacker to craft a specific malicious HTTP request, leading to a completely controlled out-of-bounds write primitive and complete system compromise. This flaw is only exploitable during the early boot phase, an attacker needs to perform a Man-in-the-Middle or compromise the boot server to be able to exploit this vulnerability successfully.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"shim","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/shim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"15.8-1~deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["15.4-7","15.6-1","15.6-1~deb10u1","15.6-1~deb11u1","15.7-1","15.7-1~deb10u1","15.7-1~deb11u1","15.8-1~deb10u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-40547.json"}},{"package":{"name":"shim","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/shim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"15.8-1~deb12u1"}]}],"versions":["15.7-1","15.8-1~deb10u1","15.8-1~deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-40547.json"}},{"package":{"name":"shim","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/shim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"15.8-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-40547.json"}},{"package":{"name":"shim","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/shim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"15.8-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-40547.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-40547"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
