The function hid_ishtp_cl_deinit() is called before ishtp_hid_remove(), which can lead to accessing freed memory or resources during the removal process.  Call Trace:  ? ishtp_cl_send+0x168/0x220 [intel_ishtp]  ? hid_output_report+0xe3/0x150 [hid]  hid_ishtp_set_feature+0xb5/0x120 [intel_ishtp_hid]  ishtp_hid_request+0x7b/0xb0 [intel_ishtp_hid]  hid_hw_request+0x1f/0x40 [hid]  sensor_hub_set_feature+0x11f/0x190 [hid_sensor_hub]  _hid_sensor_power_state+0x147/0x1e0 [hid_sensor_trigger]  hid_sensor_runtime_resume+0x22/0x30 [hid_sensor_trigger]  sensor_hub_remove+0xa8/0xe0 [hid_sensor_hub]  hid_device_remove+0x49/0xb0 [hid]  hid_destroy_device+0x6f/0x90 [hid]  ishtp_hid_remove+0x42/0x70 [intel_ishtp_hid]  hid_ishtp_cl_remove+0x6b/0xb0 [intel_ishtp_hid]  ishtp_cl_device_remove+0x4a/0x60 [intel_ishtp]  ...  Additionally, ishtp_hid_remove() is a HID level power off, which should occur before the ISHTP level disconnect.  This patch resolves the issue by reordering the calls in hid_ishtp_cl_remove(). The function ishtp_hid_remove() is now called before hid_ishtp_cl_deinit().","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.19-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-21929.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.19-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-21929.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-21929"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
