{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-4404","published":"2025-06-17T14:15:32Z","modified":"2025-08-09T19:01:27Z","related":["ALSA-2025:9184","ALSA-2025:9188","ALSA-2025:9190"],"details":"A privilege escalation from host to domain vulnerability was found in the FreeIPA project. The FreeIPA package fails to validate the uniqueness of the `krbCanonicalName` for the admin account by default, allowing users to create services with the same canonical name as the REALM admin. When a successful attack happens, the user can retrieve a Kerberos ticket in the name of this service, containing the admin@REALM credential. This flaw allows an attacker to perform administrative tasks over the REALM, leading to access to sensitive data and sensitive data exfiltration.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:9184"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:9185"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:9186"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:9187"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:9188"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:9189"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:9190"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:9191"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:9192"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:9193"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:9194"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2364606"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-4404"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://pagure.io/freeipa/c/6b9400c135ed16b10057b350cc9ce42aa0e862d4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://pagure.io/freeipa/c/796ed20092d554ee0c9e23295e346ec1e8a0bf6e"}]}
