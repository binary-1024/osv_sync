{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-71133","published":"2026-01-14T15:16:03.053Z","modified":"2026-01-15T11:18:35.763699Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-71133"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/irdma: avoid invalid read in irdma_net_event  irdma_net_event() should not dereference anything from \"neigh\" (alias \"ptr\") until it has checked that the event is NETEVENT_NEIGH_UPDATE. Other events come with different structures pointed to by \"ptr\" and they may be smaller than struct neighbour.  Move the read of neigh->dev under the NETEVENT_NEIGH_UPDATE case.  The bug is mostly harmless, but it triggers KASAN on debug kernels:   BUG: KASAN: stack-out-of-bounds in irdma_net_event+0x32e/0x3b0 [irdma]  Read of size 8 at addr ffffc900075e07f0 by task
