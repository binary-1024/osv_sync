LAM before 9.3 allows stored cross-site scripting in the Profile section via the profile name field, which renders untrusted input as HTML and executes a supplied script (for example a script element). An authenticated user with permission to create or edit a profile can insert a script payload into the profile name and have it executed when the profile data is viewed in a browser. This issue is fixed in version 9.3. No known workarounds are mentioned.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ldap-account-manager","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ldap-account-manager?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["7.4-1","7.5-1","7.7-1","7.9-1","7.9.1-1","8.0.1-0+deb11u1","8.0.1-1","8.0.1-1.1","8.1-1","8.2-1","8.3-1","8.5-1","8.6-1","8.7-1","9.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-58174.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ldap-account-manager","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ldap-account-manager?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["8.3-1","8.5-1","8.6-1","8.7-1","9.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-58174.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ldap-account-manager","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ldap-account-manager?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["9.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-58174.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ldap-account-manager","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ldap-account-manager?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["9.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-58174.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-58174"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
