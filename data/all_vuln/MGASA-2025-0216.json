If a string is already very large, combining it with more\ninput can cause a hidden overflow in the size calculation. This makes\nthe system think it has enough memory when it doesn’t. As a result, data\nmay be written past the end of the allocated memory, leading to crashes\nor memory corruption.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"glib2.0","ecosystem":"Mageia:9","purl":"pkg:rpm/mageia/glib2.0?arch=source&distro=mageia-9"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.76.3-1.5.mga9"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"section":"core"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://advisories.mageia.org/MGASA-2025-0216.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://advisories.mageia.org/MGASA-2025-0216.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugs.mageia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=34412"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/security-announce@lists.opensuse.org/message/JCF4CXWHQ7T6REXQFZTU4OS54OXUZ2HW/"}],"credits":[{"name":"Mageia","contact":["https://wiki.mageia.org/en/Packages_Security_Team"],"type":"COORDINATOR"}]}
