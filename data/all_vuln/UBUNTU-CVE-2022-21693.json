In affected versions an adversary with a primitive that allows for filesystem access from the context of the Onionshare process can access sensitive files in the entire user home folder. This could lead to the leaking of sensitive data. Due to the automatic exclusion of hidden folders, the impact is reduced. This can be mitigated by usage of the flatpak release.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"onionshare","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:22.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/onionshare@2.2-3?arch=source&distro=jammy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.2-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"onionshare","binary_version":"2.2-3"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2022/UBUNTU-CVE-2022-21693.json"}},{"package":{"name":"onionshare","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/onionshare@2.6-6ubuntu1?arch=source&distro=noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.6-6ubuntu1"}]}],"versions":["2.6-5"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"onionshare","binary_version":"2.6-6ubuntu1"},{"binary_name":"onionshare-cli","binary_version":"2.6-6ubuntu1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2022/UBUNTU-CVE-2022-21693.json"}},{"package":{"name":"onionshare","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.04","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/onionshare@2.6.3-1?arch=source&distro=plucky"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.6.3-1"}]}],"versions":["2.6-6ubuntu1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"onionshare","binary_version":"2.6.3-1"},{"binary_name":"onionshare-cli","binary_version":"2.6.3-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2022/UBUNTU-CVE-2022-21693.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-21693"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/security/advisories/GHSA-jgm9-xpfj-4fq6"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/releases/tag/v2.5"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21693"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"},{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
