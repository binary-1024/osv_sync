A bug was found in containerd prior to versions 1.6.38, 1.7.27, and 2.0.4 where containers launched with a User set as a `UID:GID` larger than the maximum 32-bit signed integer can cause an overflow condition where the container ultimately runs as root (UID 0). This could cause unexpected behavior for environments that require containers to run as a non-root user. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.38, 1.7.27, and 2.04. As a workaround, ensure that only trusted images are used and that only trusted users have permissions to import images.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"containerd","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/containerd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.13~ds1-1~deb11u5"}]}],"versions":["1.4.12~ds1-1~deb11u1","1.4.13~ds1-1~deb11u1","1.4.13~ds1-1~deb11u2","1.4.13~ds1-1~deb11u3","1.4.13~ds1-1~deb11u4","1.4.5~ds1-2","1.4.5~ds1-2+deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-40635.json"}},{"package":{"name":"containerd","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/containerd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.6.20~ds1-1","1.6.20~ds1-1+deb12u1","1.6.20~ds1-2","1.6.24~ds1-1","1.6.24~ds1-2","1.7.18~ds1-1","1.7.18~ds1-2","1.7.18~ds1-3","1.7.18~ds1-4","1.7.18~ds1-5","1.7.18~ds1-6","1.7.18~ds2-1","1.7.20~ds2-1","1.7.20~ds2-2","1.7.21~ds2-1","1.7.22~ds1-1","1.7.23~ds1-1","1.7.23~ds1-2","1.7.23~ds1-3","1.7.23~ds2-1","1.7.24~ds1-1","1.7.24~ds1-2","1.7.24~ds1-3","1.7.24~ds1-4","1.7.24~ds1-5","1.7.24~ds1-6","1.7.24~ds1-7","1.7.24~ds1-8"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-40635.json"}},{"package":{"name":"containerd","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/containerd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.7.24~ds1-6"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-40635.json"}},{"package":{"name":"containerd","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/containerd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.7.24~ds1-6"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-40635.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-40635"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
