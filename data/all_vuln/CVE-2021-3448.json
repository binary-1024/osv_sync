When configured to use a specific server for a given network interface, dnsmasq uses a fixed port while forwarding queries. An attacker on the network, able to find the outgoing port used by dnsmasq, only needs to guess the random transmission ID to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This flaw makes a DNS Cache Poisoning attack much easier. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.","references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1939368"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-20"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CVTJUOFFFHINLKWAOC2ZSC5MOPD4SJ24/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FHG7GWSQWKF7JXIMLOGJBKZWBB4VIAJ7/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GHURNEHHUBSW45KMIZ4FNBCSUPWPGV5V/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
