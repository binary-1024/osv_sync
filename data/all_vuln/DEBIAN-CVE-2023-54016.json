In ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup(), during descriptor cleanup rx_descs and tx_descs memory is not freed.  This is cause of memory leak. These allocated memory should be freed in ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup.  In ath12k_dp_cc_desc_init(), we can save base address of rx_descs and tx_descs. In ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup(), we can free rx_descs and tx_descs memory using their base address.
