{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-40901","published":"2024-07-12T13:15:13Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:19:20.253874Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-40901"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: mpt3sas: Avoid test/set_bit() operating in non-allocated memory  There is a potential out-of-bounds access when using test_bit() on a single word. The test_bit() and set_bit() functions operate on long values, and when testing or setting a single word, they can exceed the word boundary. KASAN detects this issue and produces a dump:  \t BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in _scsih_add_device.constprop.0 (./arch/x86/include/asm/bitops.h:60 ./include/asm-generic/bitops/instrumented-atomic.h:29 drivers/scsi/mpt3sas/mpt3sas_scsih.c:7331) mpt3sas  \t Write of size 8 at addr ffff8881d26e3c60 by task kworker/u1536:2/2965  For full log, please look at [1].  Make the allocation at least the size of sizeof(unsigned long) so that set_bit() and test_bit() have sufficient room for read/write operations without overwriting unallocated memory.
