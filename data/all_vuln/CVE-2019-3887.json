In that, L1 guest could access L0's APIC register values via L2 guest, when 'virtualize x2APIC mode' is enabled. A guest could use this flaw to potentially crash the host kernel resulting in DoS issue. Kernel versions from 4.16 and newer are vulnerable to this issue.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107850"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2703"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2741"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2019-3887"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3979-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3980-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3980-2/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IWPOIII2L73HV5PGXSGMRMKQIK47UIYE/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
