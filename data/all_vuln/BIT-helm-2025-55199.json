Prior to version 3.18.5, it is possible to craft a JSON Schema file in a manner which could cause Helm to use all available memory and have an out of memory (OOM) termination. This issue has been resolved in Helm 3.18.5. A workaround involves ensuring all Helm charts that are being loaded into Helm do not have any reference of $ref pointing to /dev/zero.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"helm","ecosystem":"Bitnami","purl":"pkg:bitnami/helm"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.18.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/bitnami/vulndb/tree/main/data/helm/BIT-helm-2025-55199.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/b78692c18f0fb38fe5ba4571a674de067a4c53a5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-9h84-qmv7-982p"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-55199"}],"database_specific":{"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:helm:helm:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"severity":"Medium"}}
