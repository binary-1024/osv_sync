Version 0.46.3 of the PyVista Project is vulnerable to remote code execution via dependency confusion. Two pieces of code use`--extra-index-url`. But when `--extra-index-url` is used, pip always checks for the PyPI index first, and then the external index. One package listed in the code is not published in PyPI. If an attacker publishes a package with higher version in PyPI, the malicious code from the attacker controlled package may be pulled, leading to remote code execution and a supply chain attack. As of time of publication, a patched version is unavailable.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-pyvista","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-pyvista?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.44.1-11","0.46.3-1~exp1","0.46.3-1~exp2","0.46.3-1~exp3","0.46.3-1~exp4","0.46.3-1~exp5","0.46.3-1~exp6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-61774.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-pyvista","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-pyvista?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.44.1-11","0.46.3-1~exp1","0.46.3-1~exp2","0.46.3-1~exp3","0.46.3-1~exp4","0.46.3-1~exp5","0.46.3-1~exp6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-61774.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-61774"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
