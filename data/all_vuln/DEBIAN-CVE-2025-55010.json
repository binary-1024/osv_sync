Prior to version 1.2.47, an unsafe deserialization vulnerability in the ProjectEventActvityFormatter allows admin users the ability to instantiate arbitrary php objects by modifying the event[\"data\"] field in the project_activities table. A malicious actor can update this field to use a php gadget to write a web shell into the /plugins folder, which then gives remote code execution on the host system. This issue has been patched in version 1.2.47.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kanboard","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/kanboard?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.47+ds-1"}]}],"versions":["1.2.22+ds-1","1.2.23+ds-1","1.2.23+ds-1.1","1.2.25+ds-1","1.2.25+ds-2","1.2.25+ds-3","1.2.26+ds-1","1.2.26+ds-2","1.2.26+ds-3","1.2.26+ds-4","1.2.30+ds-1","1.2.31+ds-1","1.2.31+ds2-1","1.2.44+ds-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-55010.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-55010"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
