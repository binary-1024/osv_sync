This might allow attackers to bypass a WAF with a crafted payload, aka \"Content-Type confusion\" between the WAF and the backend application. This occurs when the web application relies on only the last Content-Type header. Other platforms may reject the additional Content-Type header or merge conflicting headers, leading to detection as a malformed header.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"modsecurity-crs","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/modsecurity-crs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.3.0-1","3.3.0-1+deb11u1","3.3.2-1","3.3.4-1","3.3.4-1~deb11u1","3.3.5-1","3.3.5-2","3.3.6-1","3.3.7-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-38199.json"}},{"package":{"name":"modsecurity-crs","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/modsecurity-crs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.3.4-1","3.3.5-1","3.3.5-2","3.3.6-1","3.3.7-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-38199.json"}},{"package":{"name":"modsecurity-crs","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/modsecurity-crs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.3.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-38199.json"}},{"package":{"name":"modsecurity-crs","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/modsecurity-crs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.3.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-38199.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-38199"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
