It is inspired by Django&apos;s templating system but extends it with an expressive language that gives template authors a more powerful set of tools. On top of that it adds sandboxed execution and optional automatic escaping for applications where security is important.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nJinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.5, An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja&apos;s sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don&apos;t escape the sandbox. However, it&apos;s possible to store a reference to a malicious string&apos;s format method, then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja, but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix, such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.5.(CVE-2024-56326)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-jinja2","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python-jinja2&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.0.3-5.oe2203sp3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"noarch":["python-jinja2-help-3.0.3-5.oe2203sp3.noarch.rpm","python3-jinja2-3.0.3-5.oe2203sp3.noarch.rpm"],"src":["python-jinja2-3.0.3-5.oe2203sp3.src.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-2598.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2024-2598"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56326"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Critical"}}
