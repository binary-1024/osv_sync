Prior to version 1.4.3, in base64urlDecode, padding-stripping dereferences input[inputLen - 1] before checking that inputLen > 0 or that input != NULL. For inputLen == 0, this becomes an OOB read at input[-1], potentially crashing the process. If input == NULL and inputLen == 0, it dereferences NULL - 1.
