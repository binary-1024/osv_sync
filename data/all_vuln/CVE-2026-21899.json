Prior to version 1.4.3, in base64urlDecode, padding-stripping dereferences input[inputLen - 1] before checking that inputLen > 0 or that input != NULL. For inputLen == 0, this becomes an OOB read at input[-1], potentially crashing the process. If input == NULL and inputLen == 0, it dereferences NULL - 1. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nasa/cryptolib","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9ffda0ff78e8f74c58db4c181923196870e04c3e"}]}],"versions":["v0.1-engineering-release","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-21899.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/21xxx/CVE-2026-21899.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/releases/tag/v1.4.3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-wc29-5hw7-mpj8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-21899"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-125"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/21xxx/CVE-2026-21899.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
