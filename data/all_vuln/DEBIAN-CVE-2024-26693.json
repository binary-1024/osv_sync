The iwl_mvm_is_dup() function couldn't find the per-queue dup_data which was not allocated.  The root cause for that is that we ran out of stations in the firmware and we didn't really add the station to the firmware, yet we didn't return an error to mac80211. Mac80211 was thinking that we have the station and because of that, sta_info::uploaded was set to 1. This allowed ieee80211_find_sta_by_ifaddr() to return a valid station object, but that ieee80211_sta didn't have any iwl_mvm_sta object initialized and that caused the crash mentioned earlier when we got Rx on that station.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.7.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-26693.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.7.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-26693.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-26693"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
