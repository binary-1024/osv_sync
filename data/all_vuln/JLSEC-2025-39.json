In this version, `svg` and `math` tags are removed by default.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAdd the `math` and `svg` elements to your whitelist manually via e.g.\n\n```\nwhitelist = deepcopy(HTMLSanitizer.WHITELIST)\nappend!(whitelist[:removed_elements], [\"math\", \"svg\"])\n```\n\nand pass this modified whitelist to `sanitize`:\n\n```\nsanitize(user_input, whitelist=whitelist)\n```\n\n### References\n\n[PR for fix](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/HTMLSanitizer.jl/pull/5)\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to  Chen T for finding and reporting this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"HTMLSanitizer","ecosystem":"Julia","purl":"pkg:julia/HTMLSanitizer?uuid=9a15a9f4-ddd5-46ee-89fc-c219f813dd6f"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.2.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/SecurityAdvisories.jl/tree/generated/osv/2025/JLSEC-2025-39.json"}}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC-BY-4.0","sources":[{"html_url":"https://github.com/JuliaComputing/HTMLSanitizer.jl/security/advisories/GHSA-3mj7-qxh9-6q4p","id":"GHSA-3mj7-qxh9-6q4p","imported":"2025-10-14T02:21:59.106Z","modified":"2025-06-23T13:45:18Z","published":"2025-06-23T13:44:51Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JuliaComputing/HTMLSanitizer.jl/security-advisories/GHSA-3mj7-qxh9-6q4p"}]}}
