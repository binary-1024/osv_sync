  "details": "CVE-2024-7347: NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus have a vulnerability in\nthe ngx_http_mp4_module, which might allow an attacker to over-read\nNGINX worker memory resulting in its termination, using a specially\ncrafted mp4 file. The issue only affects NGINX if it is built with the\nngx_http_mp4_module and the mp4 directive is used in the configuration\nfile. Additionally, the attack is possible only if an attacker can\ntrigger the processing of a specially crafted mp4 file with the\nngx_http_mp4_module. Note: Software versions which have reached End of\nTechnical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.\n",
