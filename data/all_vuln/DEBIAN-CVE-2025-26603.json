{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-26603","published":"2025-02-18T19:15:29Z","modified":"2025-10-14T04:26:07.106113Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-26603"],"details":"Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi. Vim allows to redirect screen messages using the `:redir` ex command to register, variables and files. It also allows to show the contents of registers using the `:registers` or `:display` ex command. When redirecting the output of `:display` to a register, Vim will free the register content before storing the new content in the register. Now when redirecting the `:display` command to a register that is being displayed, Vim will free the content while shortly afterwards trying to access it, which leads to a use-after-free. Vim pre 9.1.1115 checks in the ex_display() function, that it does not try to redirect to a register while displaying this register at the same time. However this check is not complete, and so Vim does not check the `+` and `*` registers (which typically donate the X11/clipboard registers, and when a clipboard connection is not possible will fall back to use register 0 instead. In Patch 9.1.1115 Vim will therefore skip outputting to register zero when trying to redirect to the clipboard registers `*` or `+`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"vim","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/vim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2:8.2.2434-3","2:8.2.2434-3+deb11u1","2:8.2.2434-3+deb11u2","2:8.2.2434-3+deb11u3","2:8.2.3455-1","2:8.2.3455-2","2:8.2.3565-1","2:8.2.3995-1","2:8.2.4659-1","2:8.2.4793-1","2:9.0.0135-1","2:9.0.0229-1","2:9.0.0242-1","2:9.0.0626-1","2:9.0.0813-1","2:9.0.1000-1","2:9.0.1000-2","2:9.0.1000-3","2:9.0.1000-4","2:9.0.1378-1","2:9.0.1378-2","2:9.0.1658-1","2:9.0.1672-1","2:9.0.1894-1","2:9.0.2018-1","2:9.0.2087-1","2:9.0.2103-1","2:9.0.2116-1","2:9.0.2189-1","2:9.1.0-1","2:9.1.0016-1","2:9.1.0199-1","2:9.1.0374-1","2:9.1.0377-1","2:9.1.0496-1","2:9.1.0698-1","2:9.1.0709-1","2:9.1.0709-2","2:9.1.0777-1","2:9.1.0861-1","2:9.1.0967-1","2:9.1.0967-2","2:9.1.1113-1","2:9.1.1230-1","2:9.1.1230-2","2:9.1.1385-1","2:9.1.1766-1","2:9.1.1829-1","2:9.1.1846-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-26603.json"}},{"package":{"name":"vim","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/vim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2:9.0.1378-2","2:9.0.1378-2+deb12u1","2:9.0.1378-2+deb12u2","2:9.0.1658-1","2:9.0.1672-1","2:9.0.1894-1","2:9.0.2018-1","2:9.0.2087-1","2:9.0.2103-1","2:9.0.2116-1","2:9.0.2189-1","2:9.1.0-1","2:9.1.0016-1","2:9.1.0199-1","2:9.1.0374-1","2:9.1.0377-1","2:9.1.0496-1","2:9.1.0698-1","2:9.1.0709-1","2:9.1.0709-2","2:9.1.0777-1","2:9.1.0861-1","2:9.1.0967-1","2:9.1.0967-2","2:9.1.1113-1","2:9.1.1230-1","2:9.1.1230-2","2:9.1.1385-1","2:9.1.1766-1","2:9.1.1829-1","2:9.1.1846-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-26603.json"}},{"package":{"name":"vim","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/vim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2:9.1.1230-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-26603.json"}},{"package":{"name":"vim","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/vim?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2:9.1.1230-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-26603.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-26603"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
