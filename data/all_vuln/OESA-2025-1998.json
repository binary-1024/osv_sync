  "details": "A comprehensive WSGI web application library\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nWerkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. If an upload of a file that starts with CR or LF and then is followed by megabytes of data without these characters: all of these bytes are appended chunk by chunk into internal bytearray and lookup for boundary is performed on growing buffer. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests. This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.0.1.(CVE-2023-46136)\n\nWerkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. The debugger in affected versions of Werkzeug can allow an attacker to execute code on a developer&apos;s machine under some circumstances. This requires the attacker to get the developer to interact with a domain and subdomain they control, and enter the debugger PIN, but if they are successful it allows access to the debugger even if it is only running on localhost. This also requires the attacker to guess a URL in the developer&apos;s application that will trigger the debugger. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.0.3.(CVE-2024-34069)",
