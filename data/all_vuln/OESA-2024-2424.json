Let&apos;s assume there&apos;s a inode (ie ino 261) with i_count 1 is called by iput(), and there&apos;s a concurrent thread calling generic_shutdown_super().  cpu0:                              cpu1: iput() // i_count is 1   -&gt;spin_lock(inode)   -&gt;dec i_count to 0   -&gt;iput_final()                    generic_shutdown_super()     -&gt;__inode_add_lru()               -&gt;evict_inodes()       // cause some reason[2]           -&gt;if (atomic_read(inode-&gt;i_count)) continue;       // return before                  // inode 261 passed the above check       // list_lru_add_obj()             // and then schedule out    -&gt;spin_unlock() // note here: the inode 261 // was still at sb list and hash list, // and I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE was not been set  btrfs_iget()   // after some function calls   -&gt;find_inode()     // found the above inode 261     -&gt;spin_lock(inode)    // check I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE    // and passed       -&gt;__iget()     -&gt;spin_unlock(inode)                // schedule back                                         -&gt;spin_lock(inode)                                         // check (I_NEW|I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE) flags,                                         // passed and set I_FREEING iput()                                  -&gt;spin_unlock(inode)   -&gt;spin_lock(inode)     -&gt;evict()   // dec i_count to 0   -&gt;iput_final()     -&gt;spin_unlock()     -&gt;evict()  Now, we have two threads simultaneously evicting the same inode, which may trigger the BUG(inode-&gt;i_state &amp; I_CLEAR) statement both within clear_inode() and iput().  To fix the bug, recheck the inode-&gt;i_count after holding i_lock. Because in the most scenarios, the first check is valid, and the overhead of spin_lock() can be reduced.  If there is any misunderstanding, please let me know, thanks.  [1]: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/000000000000eabe1d0619c48986@google.com/ [2]: The reason might be 1. SB_ACTIVE was removed or 2. mapping_shrinkable() return false when I reproduced the bug.(CVE-2024-47679)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  resource: fix region_intersects() vs add_memory_driver_managed()  On a system with CXL memory, the resource tree (/proc/iomem) related to CXL memory may look like something as follows.  490000000-50fffffff : CXL Window 0   490000000-50fffffff : region0     490000000-50fffffff : dax0.0       490000000-50fffffff : System RAM (kmem)  Because drivers/dax/kmem.c calls add_memory_driver_managed() during onlining CXL memory, which makes &quot;System RAM (kmem)&quot; a descendant of &quot;CXL Window X&quot;.  This confuses region_intersects(), which expects all &quot;System RAM&quot; resources to be at the top level of iomem_resource.  This can lead to bugs.  For example, when the following command line is executed to write some memory in CXL memory range via /dev/mem,   $ dd if=data of=/dev/mem bs=$((1 &lt;&lt; 10)) seek=$((0x490000000 &gt;&gt; 10)) count=1  dd: error writing &apos;/dev/mem&apos;: Bad address  1+0 records in  0+0 records out  0 bytes copied, 0.0283507 s, 0.0 kB/s  the command fails as expected.  However, the error code is wrong.  It should be &quot;Operation not permitted&quot; instead of &quot;Bad address&quot;.  More seriously, the /dev/mem permission checking in devmem_is_allowed() passes incorrectly.  Although the accessing is prevented later because ioremap() isn&apos;t allowed to map system RAM, it is a potential security issue.  During command executing, the following warning is reported in the kernel log for calling ioremap() on system RAM.   ioremap on RAM at 0x0000000490000000 - 0x0000000490000fff  WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 416 at arch/x86/mm/ioremap.c:216 __ioremap_caller.constprop.0+0x131/0x35d  Call Trace:   memremap+0xcb/0x184   xlate_dev_mem_ptr+0x25/0x2f   write_mem+0x94/0xfb   vfs_write+0x128/0x26d   ksys_write+0xac/0xfe   do_syscall_64+0x9a/0xfd   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53  The details of command execution process are as follows.  In the above resource tree, &quot;System RAM&quot; is a descendant of &quot;CXL Window 0&quot; instead of a top level resource.  So, region_intersects() will report no System RAM resources in the CXL memory region incorrectly, because it only checks the top level resources.  Consequently, devmem_is_allowed() will return 1 (allow access via /dev/mem) for CXL memory region incorrectly.  Fortunately, ioremap() doesn&apos;t allow to map System RAM and reject the access.  So, region_intersects() needs to be fixed to work correctly with the resource tree with &quot;System RAM&quot; not at top level as above.  To fix it, if we found a unmatched resource in the top level, we will continue to search matched resources in its descendant resources.  So, we will not miss any matched resources in resource tree anymore.  In the new implementation, an example resource tree  |------------- &quot;CXL Window 0&quot; ------------| |-- &quot;System RAM&quot; --|  will behave similar as the following fake resource tree for region_intersects(, IORESOURCE_SYSTEM_RAM, ),  |-- &quot;System RAM&quot; --||-- &quot;CXL Window 0a&quot; --|  Where &quot;CXL Window 0a&quot; is part of the original &quot;CXL Window 0&quot; that isn&apos;t covered by &quot;System RAM&quot;.(CVE-2024-49878)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: add more sanity checks to qdisc_pkt_len_init()  One path takes care of SKB_GSO_DODGY, assuming skb-&gt;len is bigger than hdr_len.  virtio_net_hdr_to_skb() does not fully dissect TCP headers, it only make sure it is at least 20 bytes.  It is possible for an user to provide a malicious &apos;GSO&apos; packet, total length of 80 bytes.  - 20 bytes of IPv4 header - 60 bytes TCP header - a small gso_size like 8  virtio_net_hdr_to_skb() would declare this packet as a normal GSO packet, because it would see 40 bytes of payload, bigger than gso_size.  We need to make detect this case to not underflow qdisc_skb_cb(skb)-&gt;pkt_len.(CVE-2024-49948)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: avoid potential underflow in qdisc_pkt_len_init() with UFO  After commit 7c6d2ecbda83 (&quot;net: be more gentle about silly gso requests coming from user&quot;) virtio_net_hdr_to_skb() had sanity check to detect malicious attempts from user space to cook a bad GSO packet.  Then commit cf9acc90c80ec (&quot;net: virtio_net_hdr_to_skb: count transport header in UFO&quot;) while fixing one issue, allowed user space to cook a GSO packet with the following characteristic :  IPv4 SKB_GSO_UDP, gso_size=3, skb-&gt;len = 28.  When this packet arrives in qdisc_pkt_len_init(), we end up with hdr_len = 28 (IPv4 header + UDP header), matching skb-&gt;len  Then the following sets gso_segs to 0 :  gso_segs = DIV_ROUND_UP(skb-&gt;len - hdr_len,                         shinfo-&gt;gso_size);  Then later we set qdisc_skb_cb(skb)-&gt;pkt_len to back to zero :/  qdisc_skb_cb(skb)-&gt;pkt_len += (gso_segs - 1) * hdr_len;  This leads to the following crash in fq_codel [1]  qdisc_pkt_len_init() is best effort, we only want an estimation of the bytes sent on the wire, not crashing the kernel.  This patch is fixing this particular issue, a following one adds more sanity checks for another potential bug.

We should guarantee the timer is no longer active before kfree(sbi).  When filesystem mounting fails, the flow goes to failed_mount3, where an error occurs when ext4_stop_mmpd is called, causing a read I/O failure. This triggers the ext4_handle_error function that ultimately re-arms the timer, leaving the s_err_report timer active before kfree(sbi) is called.  Fix the issue by canceling the s_err_report timer after calling ext4_stop_mmpd.(CVE-2024-49960)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: no need to continue when the number of entries is 1(CVE-2024-49967)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: drop ppath from ext4_ext_replay_update_ex() to avoid double-free  When calling ext4_force_split_extent_at() in ext4_ext_replay_update_ex(), the &apos;ppath&apos; is updated but it is the &apos;path&apos; that is freed, thus potentially triggering a double-free in the following process:  ext4_ext_replay_update_ex   ppath = path   ext4_force_split_extent_at(&amp;ppath)     ext4_split_extent_at       ext4_ext_insert_extent         ext4_ext_create_new_leaf           ext4_ext_grow_indepth             ext4_find_extent               if (depth &gt; path[0].p_maxdepth)                 kfree(path)                 ---&gt; path First freed                 *orig_path = path = NULL    ---&gt; null ppath   kfree(path)                               ---&gt; path double-free !!!

This issue is triggered when an EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE ioctl is set to require synchronous updates because the file descriptor is opened with O_SYNC. This can lead to the jbd2_journal_stop() function calling jbd2_might_wait_for_commit(), potentially causing a deadlock if the EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE call races with a write(2) system call.  This problem only arises when CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is enabled. In this case, the jbd2_might_wait_for_commit macro locks jbd2_handle in the jbd2_journal_stop function while i_data_sem is locked. This triggers lockdep because the jbd2_journal_start function might also lock the same jbd2_handle simultaneously.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with syzkaller.

So rq_qos_wake_function() calls wake_up_process(data-&gt;task), which calls try_to_wake_up(), which faults in raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&amp;p-&gt;pi_lock).  p comes from data-&gt;task, and data comes from the waitqueue entry, which is stored on the waiter&apos;s stack in rq_qos_wait(). Analyzing the core dump with drgn, I found that the waiter had already woken up and moved on to a completely unrelated code path, clobbering what was previously data-&gt;task. Meanwhile, the waker was passing the clobbered garbage in data-&gt;task to wake_up_process(), leading to the crash.  What&apos;s happening is that in between rq_qos_wake_function() deleting the waitqueue entry and calling wake_up_process(), rq_qos_wait() is finding that it already got a token and returning. The race looks like this:  rq_qos_wait()                           rq_qos_wake_function() ============================================================== prepare_to_wait_exclusive()                                         data-&gt;got_token = true;                                         list_del_init(&amp;curr-&gt;entry); if (data.got_token)         break; finish_wait(&amp;rqw-&gt;wait, &amp;data.wq);   ^- returns immediately because      list_empty_careful(&amp;wq_entry-&gt;entry)      is true ... return, go do something else ...                                         wake_up_process(data-&gt;task)                                           (NO LONGER VALID!)-^  Normally, finish_wait() is supposed to synchronize against the waker. But, as noted above, it is returning immediately because the waitqueue entry has already been removed from the waitqueue.  The bug is that rq_qos_wake_function() is accessing the waitqueue entry AFTER deleting it. Note that autoremove_wake_function() wakes the waiter and THEN deletes the waitqueue entry, which is the proper order.  Fix it by swapping the order. We also need to use list_del_init_careful() to match the list_empty_careful() in finish_wait().(CVE-2024-50082)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/mad: Improve handling of timed out WRs of mad agent  Current timeout handler of mad agent acquires/releases mad_agent_priv lock for every timed out WRs.

Both functions were originally written for use with kprobes, and access memory with plain C accesses. When uprobes was added, these were reused unmodified even though they cannot safely access user memory.  There are three key problems:  1) The plain C accesses do not have corresponding extable entries, and    thus if they encounter a fault the kernel will treat these as    unintentional accesses to user memory, resulting in a BUG() which    will kill the kernel thread, and likely lead to further issues (e.g.    lockup or panic()).  2) The plain C accesses are subject to HW PAN and SW PAN, and so when    either is in use, any attempt to simulate an access to user memory    will fault. Thus neither simulate_ldr_literal() nor    simulate_ldrsw_literal() can do anything useful when simulating a    user instruction on any system with HW PAN or SW PAN.  3) The plain C accesses are privileged, as they run in kernel context,    and in practice can access a small range of kernel virtual addresses.    The instructions they simulate have a range of +/-1MiB, and since the    simulated instructions must itself be a user instructions in the    TTBR0 address range, these can address the final 1MiB of the TTBR1    acddress range by wrapping downwards from an address in the first    1MiB of the TTBR0 address range.     In contemporary kernels the last 8MiB of TTBR1 address range is    reserved, and accesses to this will always fault, meaning this is no    worse than (1).     Historically, it was theoretically possible for the linear map or    vmemmap to spill into the final 8MiB of the TTBR1 address range, but    in practice this is extremely unlikely to occur as this would    require either:     * Having enough physical memory to fill the entire linear map all the      way to the final 1MiB of the TTBR1 address range.     * Getting unlucky with KASLR randomization of the linear map such      that the populated region happens to overlap with the last 1MiB of      the TTBR address range.     ... and in either case if we were to spill into the final page there    would be larger problems as the final page would alias with error    pointers.  Practically speaking, (1) and (2) are the big issues. Given there have been no reports of problems since the broken code was introduced, it appears that no-one is relying on probing these instructions with uprobes.  Avoid these issues by not allowing uprobes on LDR (literal) and LDRSW (literal), limiting the use of simulate_ldr_literal() and simulate_ldrsw_literal() to kprobes. Attempts to place uprobes on LDR (literal) and LDRSW (literal) will be rejected as arm_probe_decode_insn() will return INSN_REJECTED. In future we can consider introducing working uprobes support for these instructions, but this will require more significant work.(CVE-2024-50099)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tracing: Consider the NULL character when validating the event length  strlen() returns a string length excluding the null byte.

Martin KaFai Lau reported use-after-free [0] in reqsk_timer_handler().    &quot;&quot;&quot;   We are seeing a use-after-free from a bpf prog attached to   trace_tcp_retransmit_synack. The program passes the req-&gt;sk to the   bpf_sk_storage_get_tracing kernel helper which does check for null   before using it.   &quot;&quot;&quot;  The commit 83fccfc3940c (&quot;inet: fix potential deadlock in reqsk_queue_unlink()&quot;) added timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink() not to call del_timer_sync() from reqsk_timer_handler(), but it introduced a small race window.  Before the timer is called, expire_timers() calls detach_timer(timer, true) to clear timer-&gt;entry.pprev and marks it as not pending.  If reqsk_queue_unlink() checks timer_pending() just after expire_timers() calls detach_timer(), TCP will miss del_timer_sync(); the reqsk timer will continue running and send multiple SYN+ACKs until it expires.  The reported UAF could happen if req-&gt;sk is close()d earlier than the timer expiration, which is 63s by default.  The scenario would be    1. inet_csk_complete_hashdance() calls inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop(),      but del_timer_sync() is missed    2. reqsk timer is executed and scheduled again    3. req-&gt;sk is accept()ed and reqsk_put() decrements rsk_refcnt, but      reqsk timer still has another one, and inet_csk_accept() does not      clear req-&gt;sk for non-TFO sockets    4. sk is close()d    5. reqsk timer is executed again, and BPF touches req-&gt;sk  Let&apos;s not use timer_pending() by passing the caller context to __inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop().  Note that reqsk timer is pinned, so the issue does not happen in most use cases.
