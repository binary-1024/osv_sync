If a string is already very large, combining it with more input can cause a hidden overflow in the size calculation. This makes the system think it has enough memory when it doesn’t. As a result, data may be written past the end of the allocated memory, leading to crashes or memory corruption.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"glib2.0","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/glib2.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.84.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-6052.json"}},{"package":{"name":"glib2.0","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/glib2.0?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.84.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-6052.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-6052"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
