This locking appears to be leftover from before conn_hash started using RCU commit bf4c63252490b (\"Bluetooth: convert conn hash to RCU\") and not clear if it had purpose since then.  Currently, there are code paths that delete hci_conn* from elsewhere than the ordered hdev->workqueue where the RX work runs in. E.g. commit 5af1f84ed13a (\"Bluetooth: hci_sync: Fix UAF on hci_abort_conn_sync\") introduced some of these, and there probably were a few others before it.  It's better to do the locking so that even if these run concurrently no UAF is possible.  Move the lookup of hci_conn and associated socket-specific conn to protocol recv handlers, and do them within a single critical section to cover hci_conn* usage and lookup.  syzkaller has reported a crash that appears to be this issue:      [Task hdev->workqueue]          [Task 2]                                     hci_disconnect_all_sync     l2cap_recv_acldata(hcon)
