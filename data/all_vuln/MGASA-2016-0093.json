  "details": "Update openssl packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nYuval Yarom from the University of Adelaide and NICTA, Daniel Genkin from\nTechnion and Tel Aviv University, and Nadia Heninger from the University of\nPennsylvania discovered a side-channel attack which makes use of cache-bank\nconflicts on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture. This could allow local\nattackers to recover RSA private keys (CVE-2016-0702).\n\nAdam Langley from Google discovered a double free bug when parsing malformed\nDSA private keys. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of\nservice or memory corruption in applications parsing DSA private keys\nreceived from untrusted sources (CVE-2016-0705).\n\nGuido Vranken discovered an integer overflow in the BN_hex2bn and BN_dec2bn\nfunctions that can lead to a NULL pointer dereference and heap corruption.\nThis could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or memory\ncorruption in applications processing hex or dec data received from untrusted\nsources (CVE-2016-0797).\n\nEmilia K\u00e4sper of the OpenSSL development team discovered a memory leak in the\nSRP database lookup code. To mitigate the memory leak, the seed handling in\nSRP_VBASE_get_by_user is now disabled even if the user has configured a seed.\nApplications are advised to migrate to the SRP_VBASE_get1_by_user function\n(CVE-2016-0798).\n\nGuido Vranken discovered an integer overflow in the BIO_*printf functions\nthat could lead to an OOB read when printing very long strings. Additionally\nthe internal doapr_outch function can attempt to write to an arbitrary memory\nlocation in the event of a memory allocation failure. These issues will only\noccur on platforms where sizeof(size_t) > sizeof(int) like many 64 bit\nsystems. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or\nmemory corruption in applications that pass large amounts of untrusted data\nto the BIO_*printf functions (CVE-2016-0799).\n\nNote that Mageia is not vulnerable to the DROWN issue, also known as\nCVE-2016-0800, in its default configuration, as SSLv2 was disabled by\ndefault in Mageia 5.  However, upstream mitigations for DROWN have also been\nincorporated into this update, protecting systems that may have enabled it.\n",
