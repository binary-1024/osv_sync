By creating a neutron port with the direct vnic_type, creating an instance bound to that port, and then changing the vnic_type of the bound port to macvtap, an authenticated user may cause the compute service to fail to restart, resulting in a possible denial of service. Only Nova deployments configured with SR-IOV are affected.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nova","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nova?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2:22.0.1-2","2:22.0.1-2+deb11u1","2:22.4.0-1~deb11u5","2:23.0.0-1","2:23.0.0~rc1-1","2:23.0.1-1","2:23.0.2-1","2:23.0.2-3","2:24.0.0-1","2:24.0.0-2","2:24.0.0~rc1-1","2:24.0.0~rc1-2","2:24.0.0~rc1-3","2:24.0.0~rc1-4","2:25.0.0-1","2:25.0.0-2","2:25.0.0-3","2:25.0.0-4","2:25.0.0-5","2:25.0.0-6","2:25.0.0~rc1-1","2:25.0.0~rc1-2","2:25.0.1-1","2:25.0.1-2","2:25.0.1-3","2:26.0.0-1","2:26.0.0-1.1","2:26.0.0-2","2:26.0.0-4","2:26.0.0-5","2:26.0.0-6","2:26.0.0~rc1-1","2:26.0.0~rc1-2","2:26.0.0~rc1-3","2:26.1.0-1","2:26.1.0-2","2:26.1.0-4","2:26.2.2-1~deb12u3","2:27.0.0-1","2:27.0.0-2","2:27.0.0-3","2:27.0.0-4","2:27.0.0-5","2:27.0.0-6","2:27.0.0~rc1-1","2:28.0.0-1","2:28.0.0-2","2:28.0.0~rc1-1","2:29.0.0~rc1-1","2:29.0.1-1","2:29.0.1-2","2:29.0.1-3","2:29.0.1-4","2:29.0.1-5","2:29.0.1-6","2:29.0.2-1","2:29.0.2-2","2:29.0.2-4","2:30.0.0-1","2:30.0.0-2","2:30.0.0-3","2:30.0.0-4","2:30.0.0-5","2:30.0.0-6","2:30.0.0-7","2:30.0.0-8","2:30.0.0~rc1-1","2:31.0.0-1","2:31.0.0-2","2:31.0.0-3","2:31.0.0-4","2:31.0.0-5","2:31.0.0-6","2:31.0.0-7","2:31.0.0~rc1-1","2:31.0.0~rc1-2","2:32.0.0~rc1-1","2:32.0.0~rc1-2","2:32.0.0~rc1-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-37394.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nova","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nova?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2:26.0.0~rc1-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-37394.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nova","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nova?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2:26.0.0~rc1-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-37394.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nova","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/nova?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2:26.0.0~rc1-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-37394.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-37394"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
