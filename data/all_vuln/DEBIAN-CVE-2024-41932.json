Specifically, we can have a race where a cpuset update results in the task affinity no longer being a subset of the cpuset. That's fine; we have a fallback to instead use the cpuset mask. However, we have a WARN set up that will trigger if the cpuset mask has no overlap at all with the requested task affinity. This shouldn't be a warning condition; its trivial to create this condition.  Reproduced the warning by the following setup:  - $PID inside a cpuset cgroup - another thread repeatedly switching the cpuset cpus from 1-2 to just 1 - another thread repeatedly setting the $PID affinity (via taskset) to 2","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-41932.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-41932.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-41932"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
