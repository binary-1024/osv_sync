{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"UBUNTU-CVE-2025-59729","published":"2025-10-06T08:15:00Z","modified":"2026-01-20T18:33:48.148404Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-59729"],"details":"When parsing the header for a DHAV file, there's an integer underflow in offset calculation that leads to reading the duration from before the start of the allocated buffer. If we load a DHAV file that is larger than MAX_DURATION_BUFFER_SIZE bytes (0x100000) for example 0x101000 bytes, then at [0] we have size = 0x101000. At [1] we have end_buffer_size = 0x100000, and at [2] we have end_buffer_pos = 0x1000. The loop then scans backwards through the buffer looking for the dhav tag; when it is found, we'll calculate end_pos based on a 32-bit offset read from the buffer. There is subsequently a check [3] that end_pos is within the section of the file that has been copied into end_buffer, but it only correctly handles the cases where end_pos is before the start of the file or after the section copied into end_buffer, and not the case where end_pos is within the the file, but before the section copied into end_buffer. If we provide such an offset, (end_pos - end_buffer_pos) can underflow, resulting in the subsequent access at [4] occurring before the beginning of the allocation. We recommend upgrading to version 8.0 or beyond.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libav","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:Pro:14.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libav@6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1?arch=source&distro=esm-infra-legacy/trusty"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6:0.8.7-1ubuntu2","6:9.10-1ubuntu1","6:9.10-1ubuntu2","6:9.10-1ubuntu5","6:9.10-1ubuntu6","6:9.10-1ubuntu7","6:9.11-2ubuntu1","6:9.11-2ubuntu2","6:9.13-0ubuntu0.14.04.1","6:9.14-0ubuntu0.14.04.1","6:9.16-0ubuntu0.14.04.1","6:9.18-0ubuntu0.14.04.1","6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1","6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"libav-tools","binary_version":"6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libavcodec-dev","binary_version":"6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libavcodec-extra","binary_version":"6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libavcodec-extra-54","binary_version":"6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libavcodec54","binary_version":"6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libavdevice-dev","binary_version":"6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libavdevice-extra-53","binary_version":"6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libavdevice53","binary_version":"6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libavfilter-dev","binary_version":"6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libavfilter-extra-3","binary_version":"6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libavfilter3","binary_version":"6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libavformat-dev","binary_version":"6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libavformat-extra-54","binary_version":"6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libavformat54","binary_version":"6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libavresample-dev","binary_version":"6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libavresample1","binary_version":"6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libavutil-dev","binary_version":"6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libavutil-extra-52","binary_version":"6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libavutil52","binary_version":"6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libswscale-dev","binary_version":"6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libswscale-extra-2","binary_version":"6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"},{"binary_name":"libswscale2","binary_version":"6:9.20-0ubuntu0.14.04.1+esm1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-59729.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-59729"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59729"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://issuetracker.google.com/433513232"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:H/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:L/VI:H/VA:N/SC:L/SI:H/SA:N"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
