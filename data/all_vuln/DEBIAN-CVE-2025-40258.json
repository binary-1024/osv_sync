This refcount will be released by mptcp_worker().  [A] if (schedule_work(...)) { [B]     sock_hold(sk);         return true;     }  Problem is that mptcp_worker() can run immediately and complete before [B]  We need instead :      sock_hold(sk);     if (schedule_work(...))         return true;     sock_put(sk);  [1] refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.
