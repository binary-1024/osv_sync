  "details": "GNU Emacs through 28.2 allows attackers to execute commands via shell\nmetacharacters in the name of a source-code file, because lib-src/etags.c\nuses the system C library function in its implementation of the etags\nprogram. For example, a victim may use the \"etags -u *\" command (suggested\nin the etags documentation) in a situation where the current working\ndirectory has contents that depend on untrusted input. (CVE-2022-48337)\n\nAn issue was discovered in GNU Emacs through 28.2. In ruby-mode.el, the\nruby-find-library-file function has a local command injection\nvulnerability. The ruby-find-library-file function is an interactive\nfunction, and bound to C-c C-f. Inside the function, the external command\ngem is called through shell-command-to-string, but the feature-name\nparameters are not escaped. Thus, malicious Ruby source files may cause\ncommands to be executed. (CVE-2022-48338)\n\nAn issue was discovered in GNU Emacs through 28.2. htmlfontify.el has a\ncommand injection vulnerability. In the hfy-istext-command function, the\nparameter file and parameter srcdir come from external input, and\nparameters are not escaped. If a file name or directory name contains\nshell metacharacters, code may be executed. (CVE-2022-48339)\n",
