The FreeIPA package fails to validate the uniqueness of the `krbCanonicalName` for the admin account by default, allowing users to create services with the same canonical name as the REALM admin. When a successful attack happens, the user can retrieve a Kerberos ticket in the name of this service, containing the admin@REALM credential. This flaw allows an attacker to perform administrative tasks over the REALM, leading to access to sensitive data and sensitive data exfiltration.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"freeipa","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/freeipa?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.10.1+dfsg1-1+exp1","4.10.1-1+exp1","4.10.2-1","4.10.2-2","4.10.2-2+exp1","4.11.1-1","4.11.1-1+exp1","4.11.1-2","4.11.1-2+exp1","4.11.1-2.1","4.12.2-1","4.12.2-2","4.12.2-3","4.12.4-1","4.12.4-2","4.9.11-1","4.9.11-1+exp1","4.9.11-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-4404.json"}},{"package":{"name":"freeipa","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/freeipa?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.12.4-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-4404.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-4404"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
