Prior to version 0.0.22, a Path Traversal vulnerability exists when using non-default configuration options `UPLOAD_DIR` and `UPLOAD_KEEP_FILENAME=True`. An attacker can write uploaded files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem by crafting a malicious filename. Users should upgrade to version 0.0.22 to receive a patch or, as a workaround, avoid using `UPLOAD_KEEP_FILENAME=True` in project configurations.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kludex/python-multipart","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"bea7bbb2904da8ce39123a845088dc72464eaddf"}]}],"versions":["0.0.10","0.0.11","0.0.12","0.0.13","0.0.14","0.0.15","0.0.16","0.0.17","0.0.18","0.0.19","0.0.2","0.0.20","0.0.21","0.0.4","0.0.5","0.0.6","0.0.7","0.0.8","0.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24486.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24486.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart/commit/9433f4bbc9652bdde82bbe380984e32f8cfc89c4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart/releases/tag/0.0.22"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart/security/advisories/GHSA-wp53-j4wj-2cfg"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24486"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-22"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24486.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L"}]}
