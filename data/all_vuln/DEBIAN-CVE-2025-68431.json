{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68431","published":"2025-12-29T19:15:56.933Z","modified":"2026-01-22T04:16:07.344427Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-68431"],"details":"libheif is an HEIF and AVIF file format decoder and encoder. Prior to version 1.21.0, a crafted HEIF that exercises the overlay image item path triggers a heap buffer over-read in `HeifPixelImage::overlay()`. The function computes a negative row length (likely from an unclipped overlay rectangle or invalid offsets), which then underflows when converted to `size_t` and is passed to `memcpy`, causing a very large read past the end of the source plane and a crash. Version 1.21.0 contains a patch. As a workaround, avoid decoding images using `iovl` overlay boxes.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libheif","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libheif?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.11.0-1","1.11.0-1+deb11u1","1.11.0-1+deb11u2","1.12.0-1","1.12.0-2","1.13.0-1","1.14.2-1","1.15.1-1","1.16.2-1","1.16.2-2","1.16.2-3","1.17.0-1","1.17.1-1","1.17.4-1","1.17.6-1","1.17.6-2","1.17.6-3","1.17.6-4","1.18.1-1","1.18.1-2","1.18.2-1","1.18.2-2","1.19.1-1","1.19.1-1~bpo12+1","1.19.1-1~bpo12+2","1.19.3-1","1.19.3-1~bpo12+1","1.19.5-1","1.19.7-1","1.19.7-1~bpo12+1","1.19.8-1","1.20.1-1","1.20.2-1","1.20.2-2","1.21.2-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68431.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libheif","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libheif?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.15.1-1","1.15.1-1+deb12u1","1.16.2-1","1.16.2-2","1.16.2-3","1.17.0-1","1.17.1-1","1.17.4-1","1.17.6-1","1.17.6-2","1.17.6-3","1.17.6-4","1.18.1-1","1.18.1-2","1.18.2-1","1.18.2-2","1.19.1-1","1.19.1-1~bpo12+1","1.19.1-1~bpo12+2","1.19.3-1","1.19.3-1~bpo12+1","1.19.5-1","1.19.7-1","1.19.7-1~bpo12+1","1.19.8-1","1.20.1-1","1.20.2-1","1.20.2-2","1.21.2-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68431.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libheif","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libheif?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.19.8-1","1.20.1-1","1.20.2-1","1.20.2-2","1.21.2-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68431.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libheif","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libheif?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.21.2-1"}]}],"versions":["1.19.8-1","1.20.1-1","1.20.2-1","1.20.2-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68431.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-68431"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
