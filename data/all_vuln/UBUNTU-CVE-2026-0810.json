The `gix_date::parse::TimeBuf::as_str` function can generate strings containing invalid non-UTF8 characters. This issue violates the internal safety invariants of the `TimeBuf` component, leading to undefined behavior when these malformed strings are subsequently processed. This could potentially result in application instability or other unforeseen consequences.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"rust-gix-date","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/rust-gix-date@0.8.0-1?arch=source&distro=noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.8.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"librust-gix-date-dev","binary_version":"0.8.0-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2026/UBUNTU-CVE-2026-0810.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rust-gix-date","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.10","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/rust-gix-date@0.9.3-1?arch=source&distro=questing"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.9.3-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"librust-gix-date-dev","binary_version":"0.9.3-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2026/UBUNTU-CVE-2026-0810.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2026-0810"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-0810"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0140.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/issues/2305"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
