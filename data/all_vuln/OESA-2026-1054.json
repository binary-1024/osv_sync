It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++ (or other languages, depending on the chosen implementation). Python is also usable as an extension language for applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use scripting or automation interfaces.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nWhen building nested elements using xml.dom.minidom methods such as appendChild() that have a dependency on _clear_id_cache() the algorithm is quadratic. Availability can be impacted when building excessively nested documents.(CVE-2025-12084)\n\nWhen reading an HTTP response from a server, if no read amount is specified, the default behavior will be to use Content-Length. This allows a malicious server to cause the client to read large amounts of data into memory, potentially causing OOM or other DoS.(CVE-2025-13836)\n\nWhen loading a plist file, the plistlib module reads data in size specified by the file itself, meaning a malicious file can cause OOM and DoS issues(CVE-2025-13837)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python3&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.9.9-50.oe2203sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python3-3.9.9-50.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-debug-3.9.9-50.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.9.9-50.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.9.9-50.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-devel-3.9.9-50.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-unversioned-command-3.9.9-50.oe2203sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["python3-help-3.9.9-50.oe2203sp4.noarch.rpm"],"src":["python3-3.9.9-50.oe2203sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python3-3.9.9-50.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-debug-3.9.9-50.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-debuginfo-3.9.9-50.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-debugsource-3.9.9-50.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-devel-3.9.9-50.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-unversioned-command-3.9.9-50.oe2203sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2026-1054.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2026-1054"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12084"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-13836"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-13837"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
