  "summary": "Updated phpmyadmin packages fix security vulnerability",
  "details": "A flaw was identified in how phpMyAdmin processes two factor\nauthentication; a user could potentially manipulate their account to\nbypass two factor authentication in subsequent authentication sessions\n(PMASA-2022-1).\n\nA series of weaknesses was identified allowing a malicious user to submit\nmalicious information to present an XSS or HTML injection attack in the\ngraphical setup page (PMASA-2022-2).\n\nIn some scenarios, potentially sensitive information such as a the\ndatabase name can be part of the URL. This can now be optionally\nencrypted.\n\nDuring a failed log on attempt, the error message reveals the target\ndatabase server's hostname or IP address. This can reveal some\ninformation about the network infrastructure to an attacker.\n\nFixed some situations where a user is logged out when working with more\nthan one server\n\nFixed a problem with assigning privileges to a user using the multiselect\nlist when the database name has an underscore\n\nEnable cookie parameter \"SameSite\" when the PHP version is 7.3 or newer.\n",
