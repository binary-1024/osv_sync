{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2026-23004","published":"2026-01-25T15:15:55.273Z","modified":"2026-01-26T11:15:46.932216Z","upstream":["CVE-2026-23004"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dst: fix races in rt6_uncached_list_del() and rt_del_uncached_list()  syzbot was able to crash the kernel in rt6_uncached_list_flush_dev() in an interesting way [1]  Crash happens in list_del_init()/INIT_LIST_HEAD() while writing list->prev, while the prior write on list->next went well.  static inline void INIT_LIST_HEAD(struct list_head *list) { \tWRITE_ONCE(list->next, list); // This went well \tWRITE_ONCE(list->prev, list); // Crash, @list has been freed. }  Issue here is that rt6_uncached_list_del() did not attempt to lock ul->lock, as list_empty(&rt->dst.rt_uncached) returned true because the WRITE_ONCE(list->next, list) happened on the other CPU.  We might use list_del_init_careful() and list_empty_careful(), or make sure rt6_uncached_list_del() always grabs the spinlock whenever rt->dst.rt_uncached_list has been set.  A similar fix is neeed for IPv4.
