This approach is problematic since it can\nlead to a null pointer dereference while attempting to get the region\nduring programming if the parent device does not have a driver.\r\n\r\nTo address this problem, add a module owner pointer to the fpga_region\nstruct and use it to take the module&apos;s refcount. Modify the functions for\nregistering a region to take an additional owner module parameter and\nrename them to avoid conflicts. Use the old function names for helper\nmacros that automatically set the module that registers the region as the\nowner. This ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modules\nand reduces the chances of registering a region without setting the owner.\r\n\r\nAlso, update the documentation to keep it consistent with the new interface\nfor registering an fpga region.(CVE-2024-35247)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\neeprom: at24: fix memory corruption race condition\r\n\r\nIf the eeprom is not accessible, an nvmem device will be registered, the\nread will fail, and the device will be torn down.

Additionally, one of the GPIO\nchip&apos;s lines is also in the release process and holds the notifier chain&apos;s\nread rwsem.

The callback may delete a kctl element, and this can lead to a\ndeadlock when the device was in the suspended state.  Namely:\r\n\r\n* A process waits for the power up at snd_power_ref_and_wait() in\n  snd_ctl_info() or read/write() inside card-&gt;controls_rwsem.\r\n\r\n* The system gets disconnected meanwhile, and the driver tries to\n  delete a kctl via snd_ctl_remove*(); it tries to take\n  card-&gt;controls_rwsem again, but this is already locked by the\n  above.  Since the sleeper isn&apos;t woken up, this deadlocks.\r\n\r\nAn easy fix is to wake up sleepers before processing the driver\ndisconnect callbacks but right after setting the card-&gt;shutdown flag.\nThen all sleepers will abort immediately, and the code flows again.\r\n\r\nSo, basically this patch moves the wait_event() call at the right\ntiming.

A network namespace is created\n  2. An ingress qdisc is created. This allocates a tcx_entry, and\n     &amp;tcx_entry-&gt;miniq is stored in the qdisc&apos;s miniqp-&gt;p_miniq. At the\n     same time, a tcf block with index 1 is created.\n  3. chain0 is attached to the tcf block. chain0 must be connected to\n     the block linked to the ingress qdisc to later reach the function\n     tcf_chain0_head_change_cb_del() which triggers the UAF.\n  4. Create and graft a clsact qdisc. This causes the ingress qdisc\n     created in step 1 to be removed, thus freeing the previously linked\n     tcx_entry:\r\n\r\n     rtnetlink_rcv_msg()\n       =&gt; tc_modify_qdisc()\n         =&gt; qdisc_create()\n           =&gt; clsact_init() [a]\n         =&gt; qdisc_graft()\n           =&gt; qdisc_destroy()\n             =&gt; __qdisc_destroy()\n               =&gt; ingress_destroy() [b]\n                 =&gt; tcx_entry_free()\n                   =&gt; kfree_rcu() // tcx_entry freed\r\n\r\n  5. Finally, the network namespace is closed. This registers the\n     cleanup_net worker, and during the process of releasing the\n     remaining clsact qdisc, it accesses the tcx_entry that was\n     already freed in step 4, causing the UAF to occur:\r\n\r\n     cleanup_net()\n       =&gt; ops_exit_list()\n         =&gt; default_device_exit_batch()\n           =&gt; unregister_netdevice_many()\n             =&gt; unregister_netdevice_many_notify()\n               =&gt; dev_shutdown()\n                 =&gt; qdisc_put()\n                   =&gt; clsact_destroy() [c]\n                     =&gt; tcf_block_put_ext()\n                       =&gt; tcf_chain0_head_change_cb_del()\n                         =&gt; tcf_chain_head_change_item()\n                           =&gt; clsact_chain_head_change()\n                             =&gt; mini_qdisc_pair_swap() // UAF\r\n\r\nThere are also other variants, the gist is to add an ingress (or clsact)\nqdisc with a specific shared block, then to replace that qdisc, waiting\nfor the tcx_entry kfree_rcu() to be executed and subsequently accessing\nthe current active qdisc&apos;s miniq one way or another.\r\n\r\nThe correct fix is to turn the miniq_active boolean into a counter. What\ncan be observed, at step 2 above, the counter transitions from 0-&gt;1, at\nstep [a] from 1-&gt;2 (in order for the miniq object to remain active during\nthe replacement), then in [b] from 2-&gt;1 and finally [c] 1-&gt;0 with the\neventual release. The reference counter in general ranges from [0,2] and\nit does not need to be atomic since all access to the counter is protected\nby the rtnl mutex. With this in place, there is no longer a UAF happening\nand the tcx_entry is freed at the correct time.(CVE-2024-41010)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nxfs: don&apos;t walk off the end of a directory data block\r\n\r\nThis adds sanity checks for xfs_dir2_data_unused and xfs_dir2_data_entry\nto make sure don&apos;t stray beyond valid memory region.

The callback running in parallel trying to\narm the timer will fail, and freeing bpf_hrtimer without waiting is\nsufficient (given kfree_rcu), and bpf_timer_cb will return\nHRTIMER_NORESTART, preventing the timer from being rearmed again.\r\n\r\nHowever, there exists a UAF scenario where the callback arms the timer\nbefore entering this function, such that if cancellation fails (due to\ntimer callback invoking this routine, or the target timer callback\nrunning concurrently). In such a case, if the timer expiration is\nsignificantly far in the future, the RCU grace period expiration\nhappening before it will free the bpf_hrtimer state and along with it\nthe struct hrtimer, that is enqueued.\r\n\r\nHence, it is clear cancellation needs to occur after\nasync_cancel_and_free, and yet it cannot be done inline due to deadlock\nissues. We thus modify bpf_timer_cancel_and_free to defer work to the\nglobal workqueue, adding a work_struct alongside rcu_head (both used at\n_different_ points of time, so can share space).\r\n\r\nUpdate existing code comments to reflect the new state of affairs.(CVE-2024-41045)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nskmsg: Skip zero length skb in sk_msg_recvmsg\r\n\r\nWhen running BPF selftests (./test_progs -t sockmap_basic) on a Loongarch\nplatform, the following kernel panic occurs:\r\n\r\n  [...]\n  Oops[#1]:\n  CPU: 22 PID: 2824 Comm: test_progs Tainted: G           OE  6.10.0-rc2+ #18\n  Hardware name: LOONGSON Dabieshan/Loongson-TC542F0, BIOS Loongson-UDK2018\n     ... ...\n     ra: 90000000048bf6c0 sk_msg_recvmsg+0x120/0x560\n    ERA: 9000000004162774 copy_page_to_iter+0x74/0x1c0\n   CRMD: 000000b0 (PLV0 -IE -DA +PG DACF=CC DACM=CC -WE)\n   PRMD: 0000000c (PPLV0 +PIE +PWE)\n   EUEN: 00000007 (+FPE +SXE +ASXE -BTE)\n   ECFG: 00071c1d (LIE=0,2-4,10-12 VS=7)\n  ESTAT: 00010000 [PIL] (IS= ECode=1 EsubCode=0)\n   BADV: 0000000000000040\n   PRID: 0014c011 (Loongson-64bit, Loongson-3C5000)\n  Modules linked in: bpf_testmod(OE) xt_CHECKSUM xt_MASQUERADE xt_conntrack\n  Process test_progs (pid: 2824, threadinfo=0000000000863a31, task=...)\n  Stack : ...\n  Call Trace:\n  [&lt;9000000004162774&gt;] copy_page_to_iter+0x74/0x1c0\n  [&lt;90000000048bf6c0&gt;] sk_msg_recvmsg+0x120/0x560\n  [&lt;90000000049f2b90&gt;] tcp_bpf_recvmsg_parser+0x170/0x4e0\n  [&lt;90000000049aae34&gt;] inet_recvmsg+0x54/0x100\n  [&lt;900000000481ad5c&gt;] sock_recvmsg+0x7c/0xe0\n  [&lt;900000000481e1a8&gt;] __sys_recvfrom+0x108/0x1c0\n  [&lt;900000000481e27c&gt;] sys_recvfrom+0x1c/0x40\n  [&lt;9000000004c076ec&gt;] do_syscall+0x8c/0xc0\n  [&lt;9000000003731da4&gt;] handle_syscall+0xc4/0x160\n  Code: ...\n  ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\n  Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception\n  Kernel relocated by 0x3510000\n   .text @ 0x9000000003710000\n   .data @ 0x9000000004d70000\n   .bss  @ 0x9000000006469400\n  ---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception ]---\n  [...]\r\n\r\nThis crash happens every time when running sockmap_skb_verdict_shutdown\nsubtest in sockmap_basic.\r\n\r\nThis crash is because a NULL pointer is passed to page_address() in the\nsk_msg_recvmsg(). Due to the different implementations depending on the\narchitecture, page_address(NULL) will trigger a panic on Loongarch\nplatform but not on x86 platform. So this bug was hidden on x86 platform\nfor a while, but now it is exposed on Loongarch platform. The root cause\nis that a zero length skb (skb-&gt;len == 0) was put on the queue.\r\n\r\nThis zero length skb is a TCP FIN packet, which was sent by shutdown(),\ninvoked in test_sockmap_skb_verdict_shutdown():\r\n\r\n\tshutdown(p1, SHUT_WR);\r\n\r\nIn this case, in sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue(), num_sge is zero, and no\npage is put to this sge (see sg_set_page in sg_set_page), but this empty\nsge is queued into ingress_msg list.\r\n\r\nAnd in sk_msg_recvmsg(), this empty sge is used, and a NULL page is got by\nsg_page(sge). Pass this NULL page to copy_page_to_iter(), which passes it\nto kmap_local_page() and to page_address(), then kernel panics.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, we should skip this zero length skb. So in sk_msg_recvmsg(),\nif copy is zero, that means it&apos;s a zero length skb, skip invoking\ncopy_page_to_iter(). We are using the EFAULT return triggered by\ncopy_page_to_iter to check for is_fin in tcp_bpf.c.(CVE-2024-41048)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nfilelock: fix potential use-after-free in posix_lock_inode\r\n\r\nLight Hsieh reported a KASAN UAF warning in trace_posix_lock_inode().\nThe request pointer had been changed earlier to point to a lock entry\nthat was added to the inode&apos;s list.
