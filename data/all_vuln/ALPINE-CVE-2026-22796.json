When the type is not V_ASN1_OCTET_STRING,\nthis results in accessing invalid memory through the ASN1_TYPE union, causing\na crash.\n\nExploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to provide a malformed\nsigned PKCS#7 to an application that verifies it. The impact of the\nexploit is just a Denial of Service, the PKCS7 API is legacy and applications\nshould be using the CMS API instead. For these reasons the issue was\nassessed as Low severity.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue,\nas the PKCS#7 parsing implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module\nboundary.\n\nOpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are vulnerable to this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"openssl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/openssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.3.6-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.1.1-r0","1.1.1-r1","1.1.1-r2","1.1.1-r3","1.1.1-r4","1.1.1-r5","1.1.1a-r0","1.1.1a-r1","1.1.1b-r0","1.1.1b-r1","1.1.1c-r0","1.1.1c-r1","1.1.1d-r1","1.1.1d-r2","1.1.1d-r3","1.1.1d-r4","1.1.1d-r5","1.1.1e-r0","1.1.1f-r0","1.1.1g-r0","1.1.1h-r0","1.1.1i-r0","1.1.1j-r0","1.1.1k-r0","1.1.1k-r1","1.1.1l-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.0-r2","3.0.0-r3","3.0.0-r4","3.0.1-r0","3.0.1-r1","3.0.2-r0","3.0.3-r0","3.0.5-r0","3.0.5-r1","3.0.5-r2","3.0.5-r3","3.0.6-r0","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.7-r2","3.0.8-r0","3.0.8-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.0-r1","3.1.0-r2","3.1.0-r3","3.1.0-r4","3.1.0-r5","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.1-r3","3.1.2-r0","3.1.3-r0","3.1.4-r0","3.1.4-r1","3.1.4-r2","3.1.4-r3","3.1.4-r4","3.1.4-r5","3.1.5-r5","3.2.1-r0","3.2.1-r1","3.2.1-r2","3.3.0-r0","3.3.0-r1","3.3.0-r2","3.3.0-r3","3.3.1-r0","3.3.1-r1","3.3.1-r2","3.3.1-r3","3.3.2-r0","3.3.2-r1","3.3.2-r2","3.3.3-r0","3.3.4-r0","3.3.5-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2026-22796.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openssl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/openssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.3.6-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.1.1-r0","1.1.1-r1","1.1.1-r2","1.1.1-r3","1.1.1-r4","1.1.1-r5","1.1.1a-r0","1.1.1a-r1","1.1.1b-r0","1.1.1b-r1","1.1.1c-r0","1.1.1c-r1","1.1.1d-r1","1.1.1d-r2","1.1.1d-r3","1.1.1d-r4","1.1.1d-r5","1.1.1e-r0","1.1.1f-r0","1.1.1g-r0","1.1.1h-r0","1.1.1i-r0","1.1.1j-r0","1.1.1k-r0","1.1.1k-r1","1.1.1l-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.0-r2","3.0.0-r3","3.0.0-r4","3.0.1-r0","3.0.1-r1","3.0.2-r0","3.0.3-r0","3.0.5-r0","3.0.5-r1","3.0.5-r2","3.0.5-r3","3.0.6-r0","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.7-r2","3.0.8-r0","3.0.8-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.0-r1","3.1.0-r2","3.1.0-r3","3.1.0-r4","3.1.0-r5","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.1-r3","3.1.2-r0","3.1.3-r0","3.1.4-r0","3.1.4-r1","3.1.4-r2","3.1.4-r3","3.1.4-r4","3.1.4-r5","3.1.5-r5","3.2.1-r0","3.2.1-r1","3.2.1-r2","3.3.0-r0","3.3.0-r1","3.3.0-r2","3.3.0-r3","3.3.1-r0","3.3.1-r1","3.3.1-r2","3.3.1-r3","3.3.2-r0","3.3.2-r1","3.3.2-r2","3.3.2-r3","3.3.2-r4","3.3.2-r5","3.3.2-r6","3.3.3-r0","3.3.4-r0","3.3.5-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2026-22796.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openssl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/openssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.5.5-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.1.1-r0","1.1.1-r1","1.1.1-r2","1.1.1-r3","1.1.1-r4","1.1.1-r5","1.1.1a-r0","1.1.1a-r1","1.1.1b-r0","1.1.1b-r1","1.1.1c-r0","1.1.1c-r1","1.1.1d-r1","1.1.1d-r2","1.1.1d-r3","1.1.1d-r4","1.1.1d-r5","1.1.1e-r0","1.1.1f-r0","1.1.1g-r0","1.1.1h-r0","1.1.1i-r0","1.1.1j-r0","1.1.1k-r0","1.1.1k-r1","1.1.1l-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.0-r2","3.0.0-r3","3.0.0-r4","3.0.1-r0","3.0.1-r1","3.0.2-r0","3.0.3-r0","3.0.5-r0","3.0.5-r1","3.0.5-r2","3.0.5-r3","3.0.6-r0","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.7-r2","3.0.8-r0","3.0.8-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.0-r1","3.1.0-r2","3.1.0-r3","3.1.0-r4","3.1.0-r5","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.1-r3","3.1.2-r0","3.1.3-r0","3.1.4-r0","3.1.4-r1","3.1.4-r2","3.1.4-r3","3.1.4-r4","3.1.4-r5","3.1.5-r5","3.2.1-r0","3.2.1-r1","3.2.1-r2","3.3.0-r0","3.3.0-r1","3.3.0-r2","3.3.0-r3","3.3.1-r0","3.3.1-r1","3.3.1-r2","3.3.1-r3","3.3.2-r0","3.3.2-r1","3.3.2-r2","3.3.2-r3","3.3.2-r4","3.3.2-r5","3.3.2-r6","3.3.3-r0","3.5.0-r0","3.5.1-r0","3.5.2-r0","3.5.3-r0","3.5.3-r1","3.5.4-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2026-22796.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openssl","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.23","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/openssl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.5.5-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.1.1-r0","1.1.1-r1","1.1.1-r2","1.1.1-r3","1.1.1-r4","1.1.1-r5","1.1.1a-r0","1.1.1a-r1","1.1.1b-r0","1.1.1b-r1","1.1.1c-r0","1.1.1c-r1","1.1.1d-r1","1.1.1d-r2","1.1.1d-r3","1.1.1d-r4","1.1.1d-r5","1.1.1e-r0","1.1.1f-r0","1.1.1g-r0","1.1.1h-r0","1.1.1i-r0","1.1.1j-r0","1.1.1k-r0","1.1.1k-r1","1.1.1l-r0","3.0.0-r0","3.0.0-r1","3.0.0-r2","3.0.0-r3","3.0.0-r4","3.0.1-r0","3.0.1-r1","3.0.2-r0","3.0.3-r0","3.0.5-r0","3.0.5-r1","3.0.5-r2","3.0.5-r3","3.0.6-r0","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.7-r2","3.0.8-r0","3.0.8-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.0-r1","3.1.0-r2","3.1.0-r3","3.1.0-r4","3.1.0-r5","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.1-r3","3.1.2-r0","3.1.3-r0","3.1.4-r0","3.1.4-r1","3.1.4-r2","3.1.4-r3","3.1.4-r4","3.1.4-r5","3.1.5-r5","3.2.1-r0","3.2.1-r1","3.2.1-r2","3.3.0-r0","3.3.0-r1","3.3.0-r2","3.3.0-r3","3.3.1-r0","3.3.1-r1","3.3.1-r2","3.3.1-r3","3.3.2-r0","3.3.2-r1","3.3.2-r2","3.3.2-r3","3.3.2-r4","3.3.2-r5","3.3.2-r6","3.3.3-r0","3.5.0-r0","3.5.1-r0","3.5.2-r0","3.5.3-r
