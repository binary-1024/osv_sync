{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-33747","published":"2022-10-11T13:15:10Z","modified":"2025-08-09T19:01:29Z","related":["SUSE-SU-2022:3947-1","SUSE-SU-2022:4007-1"],"details":"Arm: unbounded memory consumption for 2nd-level page tables Certain actions require e.g. removing pages from a guest's P2M (Physical-to-Machine) mapping. When large pages are in use to map guest pages in the 2nd-stage page tables, such a removal operation may incur a memory allocation (to replace a large mapping with individual smaller ones). These memory allocations are taken from the global memory pool. A malicious guest might be able to cause the global memory pool to be exhausted by manipulating its own P2M mappings.","references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/10/11/5"},{"type":"FIX","url":"http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-409.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-07"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5272"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-409.txt"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TJOMUNGW6VTK5CZZRLWLVVEOUPEQBRHI/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XWSC77GS5NATI3TT7FMVPULUPXR635XQ/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YZVXG7OOOXCX6VIPEMLFDPIPUTFAYWPE/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
