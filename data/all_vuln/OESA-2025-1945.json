  "details": "Vim is an advanced text editor that seeks to provide the power of the de-facto Unix editor &amp;apos;Vi&amp;apos;, with a more complete feature set. Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nVim is an open source, command line text editor. Prior to version 9.1.1552, a path traversal issue in Vim\u2019s tar.vim plugin can allow overwriting of arbitrary files when opening specially crafted tar archives. Impact is low because this exploit requires direct user interaction. However, successfully exploitation can lead to overwriting sensitive files or placing executable code in privileged locations, depending on the permissions of the process editing the archive. The victim must edit such a file using Vim which will reveal the filename and the file content, a careful user may suspect some strange things going on. Successful exploitation could results in the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. Version 9.1.1552 contains a patch for the vulnerability.(CVE-2025-53905)\n\nVim is an open source, command line text editor.
