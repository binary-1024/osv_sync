{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-24857","published":"2026-01-28T21:30:35.410Z","modified":"2026-01-29T02:56:25.501124Z","aliases":["GHSA-rh8m-9xrx-q64q"],"summary":"bulk_extractor has Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability","details":"`bulk_extractor` is a digital forensics exploitation tool. Starting in version 1.4, `bulk_extractor`’s embedded unrar code has a heap‑buffer‑overflow in the RAR PPM LZ decoding path. A crafted RAR inside a disk image causes an out‑of‑bounds write in `Unpack::CopyString`, leading to a crash under ASAN (and likely a crash or memory corruption in production builds). There's potential for using this for RCE. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor","events":[{"introduced":"f19523ba42f735eaf0c2089466566a168c498d73"},{"last_affected":"b2279ce0c7e85cf5a68cbc1d130ffc4ac322f263"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.4"},{"last_affected":"2.1.1"}]}}],"versions":["85471cf","v1.4.0","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.5-beta1","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.3","v1.6.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-beta1","v2.0.0-beta2","v2.0.0-beta3","v2.0.3","v2.0.6","v2.1.0","v2.1.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24857.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24857.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor/security/advisories/GHSA-rh8m-9xrx-q64q"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24857"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-122"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24857.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
