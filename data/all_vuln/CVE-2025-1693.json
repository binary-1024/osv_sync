This may result in the display of falsified messages that appear to originate from mongosh or the underlying operating system, potentially misleading users into executing unsafe actions.\n\n\nThe vulnerability is exploitable only when mongosh is connected to a cluster that is partially or fully controlled by an attacker.\n\n\nThis issue affects mongosh versions prior to
