The handler for the Suspend request of the Screen Saver extension does not properly validate the request length leading to an out of bounds memory write. This can lead to local privileges elevation on systems where the X server is running privileged and remote code execution for SSH X forwarding sessions.(CVE-2021-4010)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in xorg-x11-server in versions before 21.1.2 and before 1.20.14.
