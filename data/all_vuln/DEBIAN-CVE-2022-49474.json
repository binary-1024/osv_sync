{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49474","published":"2025-02-26T07:01:23Z","modified":"2025-10-14T04:26:16.581111Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-49474"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: fix dangling sco_conn and use-after-free in sco_sock_timeout  Connecting the same socket twice consecutively in sco_sock_connect() could lead to a race condition where two sco_conn objects are created but only one is associated with the socket. If the socket is closed before the SCO connection is established, the timer associated with the dangling sco_conn object won't be canceled. As the sock object is being freed, the use-after-free problem happens when the timer callback function sco_sock_timeout() accesses the socket. Here's the call trace:  dump_stack+0x107/0x163 ? refcount_inc+0x1c/ print_address_description.constprop.0+0x1c/0x47e ? refcount_inc+0x1c/0x7b kasan_report+0x13a/0x173 ? refcount_inc+0x1c/0x7b check_memory_region+0x132/0x139 refcount_inc+0x1c/0x7b sco_sock_timeout+0xb2/0x1ba process_one_work+0x739/0xbd1 ? cancel_delayed_work+0x13f/0x13f ? __raw_spin_lock_init+0xf0/0xf0 ? to_kthread+0x59/0x85 worker_thread+0x593/0x70e kthread+0x346/0x35a ? drain_workqueue+0x31a/0x31a ? kthread_bind+0x4b/0x4b ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.127-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.103-1","5.10.103-1~bpo10+1","5.10.106-1","5.10.113-1","5.10.120-1","5.10.120-1~bpo10+1","5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1","5.10.92-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49474.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49474.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49474.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49474.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-49474"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
