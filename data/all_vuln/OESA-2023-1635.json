  "details": "The Linux Kernel, the operating system core itself.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel&apos;s ksmbd, a high-performance in-kernel SMB server. The specific flaw exists within the handling of SMB2_SESSION_SETUP commands. The issue results from the lack of control of resource consumption. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition on the system.(CVE-2023-32247)\r\n\r\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel&apos;s netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\r\n\r\nWhen nf_tables_delrule() is flushing table rules, it is not checked whether the chain is bound and the chain&apos;s owner rule can also release the objects in certain circumstances.\r\n\r\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 6eaf41e87a223ae6f8e7a28d6e78384ad7e407f8.\r\n\r\n(CVE-2023-3777)\r\n\r\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel&apos;s netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\r\n\r\nOn an error when building a nftables rule, deactivating immediate expressions in nft_immediate_deactivate() can lead unbinding the chain and objects be deactivated but later used.\r\n\r\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 0a771f7b266b02d262900c75f1e175c7fe76fec2.\r\n\r\n(CVE-2023-4015)\r\n\r\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel&apos;s net/sched: cls_route component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\r\n\r\nWhen route4_change() is called on an existing filter, the whole tcf_result struct is always copied into the new instance of the filter. This causes a problem when updating a filter bound to a class, as tcf_unbind_filter() is always called on the old instance in the success path, decreasing filter_cnt of the still referenced class and allowing it to be deleted, leading to a use-after-free.\r\n\r\nWe recommend upgrading past commit b80b829e9e2c1b3f7aae34855e04d8f6ecaf13c8.\r\n\r\n(CVE-2023-4206)\r\n\r\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel&apos;s net/sched: cls_fw component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\r\n\r\nWhen fw_change() is called on an existing filter, the whole tcf_result struct is always copied into the new instance of the filter. This causes a problem when updating a filter bound to a class, as tcf_unbind_filter() is always called on the old instance in the success path, decreasing filter_cnt of the still referenced class and allowing it to be deleted, leading to a use-after-free.\r\n\r\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 76e42ae831991c828cffa8c37736ebfb831ad5ec.\r\n\r\n(CVE-2023-4207)\r\n\r\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel&apos;s net/sched: cls_u32 component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\r\n\r\nWhen u32_change() is called on an existing filter, the whole tcf_result struct is always copied into the new instance of the filter. This causes a problem when updating a filter bound to a class, as tcf_unbind_filter() is always called on the old instance in the success path, decreasing filter_cnt of the still referenced class and allowing it to be deleted, leading to a use-after-free.\r\n\r\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 3044b16e7c6fe5d24b1cdbcf1bd0a9d92d1ebd81.\r\n\r\n(CVE-2023-4208)\r\n\r\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel&apos;s af_unix component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\r\n\r\nThe unix_stream_sendpage() function tries to add data to the last skb in the peer&apos;s recv queue without locking the queue. Thus there is a race where unix_stream_sendpage() could access an skb locklessly that is being released by garbage collection, resulting in use-after-free.\r\n\r\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 790c2f9d15b594350ae9bca7b236f2b1859de02c.\r\n\r\n(CVE-2023-4622)",
