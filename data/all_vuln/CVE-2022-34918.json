A type confusion bug in nft_set_elem_init (leading to a buffer overflow) could be used by a local attacker to escalate privileges, a different vulnerability than CVE-2022-32250. (The attacker can obtain root access, but must start with an unprivileged user namespace to obtain CAP_NET_ADMIN access.) This can be fixed in nft_setelem_parse_data in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/168191/Kernel-Live-Patch-Security-Notice-LSN-0089-1.html"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/168543/Netfilter-nft_set_elem_init-Heap-Overflow-Privilege-Escalation.html"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/07/05/1"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/08/06/5"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/netdev/net.git/commit/?id=7e6bc1f6cabcd30aba0b11219d8e01b952eacbb6"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220826-0004/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5191"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/07/02/3"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://www.randorisec.fr/crack-linux-firewall/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lore.kernel.org/netfilter-devel/cd9428b6-7ffb-dd22-d949-d86f4869f452%40randorisec.fr/T/#u"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
