Versions of z2d after `0.5.1` and up to and including `0.6.0`, when writing from one surface to another using `z2d.compositor.StrideCompositor.run`, and higher-level operations when the anti-aliasing mode is set to `.default` (such as `Context.fill`, `Context.stroke`, `painter.fill`, and `painter.stroke`), the source surface can be completely out-of-bounds on the x-axis, but not on the y-axis, by way of a negative offset. This results in an overflow of the value controlling the length of the stride. In non-safe optimization modes (consumers compiling with `ReleaseFast` or `ReleaseSmall`), this could potentially lead to invalid memory accesses or corruption.\n\nThis issue is patched in version `0.6.1`. Users on an untagged version after `v0.5.1` and before `v0.6.1` are advised to update to address the vulnerability. Those still on Zig `0.13.0` are recommended to downgrade to `v0.5.1`.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-46333.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"> 0.5.1, <= 0.6.0"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/vancluever/z2d/security/advisories/GHSA-mm4c-p35v-7hx3"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/vancluever/z2d/issues/104"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/vancluever/z2d/issues/105"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H"}]}
