{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-46333","published":"2025-04-25T20:20:22.202Z","modified":"2026-01-13T19:56:09.735133Z","aliases":["GHSA-mm4c-p35v-7hx3"],"summary":"z2d OOB composition could lead to invalid memory access and corruption","details":"z2d is a pure Zig 2D graphics library. Versions of z2d after `0.5.1` and up to and including `0.6.0`, when writing from one surface to another using `z2d.compositor.StrideCompositor.run`, and higher-level operations when the anti-aliasing mode is set to `.default` (such as `Context.fill`, `Context.stroke`, `painter.fill`, and `painter.stroke`), the source surface can be completely out-of-bounds on the x-axis, but not on the y-axis, by way of a negative offset. This results in an overflow of the value controlling the length of the stride. In non-safe optimization modes (consumers compiling with `ReleaseFast` or `ReleaseSmall`), this could potentially lead to invalid memory accesses or corruption.\n\nThis issue is patched in version `0.6.1`. Users on an untagged version after `v0.5.1` and before `v0.6.1` are advised to update to address the vulnerability. Those still on Zig `0.13.0` are recommended to downgrade to `v0.5.1`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vancluever/z2d","events":[{"introduced":"a99bf85d38d716d30b79c3546e7063af2e861f49"},{"last_affected":"5d41e5ed8f388fc3fa39210cc93ee5584e7d7d6f"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0.5.1"},{"last_affected":"0.6.0"}]}}],"versions":["v0.5.1","v0.6.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-46333.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/46xxx/CVE-2025-46333.json"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/vancluever/z2d/issues/104"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/vancluever/z2d/issues/105"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/vancluever/z2d/security/advisories/GHSA-mm4c-p35v-7hx3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46333"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-119","CWE-122","CWE-190"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/46xxx/CVE-2025-46333.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H"}]}
