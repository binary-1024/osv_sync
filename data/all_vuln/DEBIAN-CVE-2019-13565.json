When using SASL authentication and session encryption, and relying on the SASL security layers in slapd access controls, it is possible to obtain access that would otherwise be denied via a simple bind for any identity covered in those ACLs. After the first SASL bind is completed, the sasl_ssf value is retained for all new non-SASL connections. Depending on the ACL configuration, this can affect different types of operations (searches, modifications, etc.). In other words, a successful authorization step completed by one user affects the authorization requirement for a different user.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"openldap","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openldap?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.48+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"low"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-13565.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openldap","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openldap?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.48+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"low"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-13565.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openldap","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openldap?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.48+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"low"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-13565.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openldap","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openldap?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.48+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"low"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-13565.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-13565"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
