In versions prior to 4.2.0, there is a denial of service vulnerability in the `If-Match` and `If-None-Match` header parsing component of Sinatra, if the `etag` method is used when constructing the response. Carefully crafted input can cause `If-Match` and `If-None-Match` header parsing in Sinatra to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a denial of service attack vector. This header is typically involved in generating the `ETag` header value. Any applications that use the `etag` method when generating a response are impacted. Version 4.2.0 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ruby-sinatra","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ruby-sinatra?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.8.1-2","2.0.8.1-2+deb11u1","2.2.2-1","3.0.3-1","3.0.5-1","3.0.5-2","3.0.5-3","3.2.0-1","4.1.1-1","4.1.1-2","4.1.1-3","4.1.1-4","4.1.1-5","4.1.1-6","4.2.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-61921.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ruby-sinatra","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ruby-sinatra?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.0.5-3+deb12u1"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-61921.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ruby-sinatra","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ruby-sinatra?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4.1.1-5","4.1.1-6","4.2.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-61921.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ruby-sinatra","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ruby-sinatra?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.2.1-1"}]}],"versions":["4.1.1-5","4.1.1-6"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-61921.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-61921"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
