This vulnerability may allow an attacker to complete EAP-PWD authentication without knowing the password. However, unless the crypto library does not implement additional checks for the EC point, the attacker will not be able to derive the session key or complete the key exchange. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.4 are affected. Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support and wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wpa_supplicant","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/wpa_supplicant?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.7-r2"}]}],"versions":["0.5.11-r0","0.6.10-r0","0.6.9-r0","0.6.9-r1","0.7.1-r0","0.7.1-r1","0.7.1-r2","0.7.2-r0","0.7.2-r1","0.7.2-r2","0.7.3-r0","0.7.3-r1","0.7.3-r2","1.0-r0","1.0-r1","1.0-r2","1.1-r0","1.1-r1","2.0-r0","2.0-r1","2.0-r2","2.0-r3","2.1-r0","2.1-r1","2.1-r2","2.2-r0","2.3-r0","2.3-r1","2.4-r0","2.4-r1","2.4-r2","2.4-r3","2.4-r4","2.4-r5","2.4-r6","2.4-r7","2.4-r8","2.5-r0","2.5-r1","2.5-r2","2.5-r3","2.6-r0","2.6-r1","2.6-r10","2.6-r11","2.6-r12","2.6-r13","2.6-r14","2.6-r15","2.6-r2","2.6-r3","2.6-r4","2.6-r5","2.6-r6","2.6-r7","2.6-r8","2.6-r9","2.7-r0","2.7-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-9497.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wpa_supplicant","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/wpa_supplicant?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.7-r2"}]}],"versions":["0.5.11-r0","0.6.10-r0","0.6.9-r0","0.6.9-r1","0.7.1-r0","0.7.1-r1","0.7.1-r2","0.7.2-r0","0.7.2-r1","0.7.2-r2","0.7.3-r0","0.7.3-r1","0.7.3-r2","1.0-r0","1.0-r1","1.0-r2","1.1-r0","1.1-r1","2.0-r0","2.0-r1","2.0-r2","2.0-r3","2.1-r0","2.1-r1","2.1-r2","2.2-r0","2.3-r0","2.3-r1","2.4-r0","2.4-r1","2.4-r2","2.4-r3","2.4-r4","2.4-r5","2.4-r6","2.4-r7","2.4-r8","2.5-r0","2.5-r1","2.5-r2","2.5-r3","2.6-r0","2.6-r1","2.6-r10","2.6-r11","2.6-r12","2.6-r13","2.6-r14","2.6-r15","2.6-r2","2.6-r3","2.6-r4","2.6-r5","2.6-r6","2.6-r7","2.6-r8","2.6-r9","2.7-r0","2.7-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-9497.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wpa_supplicant","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/wpa_supplicant?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.7-r2"}]}],"versions":["0.5.11-r0","0.6.10-r0","0.6.9-r0","0.6.9-r1","0.7.1-r0","0.7.1-r1","0.7.1-r2","0.7.2-r0","0.7.2-r1","0.7.2-r2","0.7.3-r0","0.7.3-r1","0.7.3-r2","1.0-r0","1.0-r1","1.0-r2","1.1-r0","1.1-r1","2.0-r0","2.0-r1","2.0-r2","2.0-r3","2.1-r0","2.1-r1","2.1-r2","2.2-r0","2.3-r0","2.3-r1","2.4-r0","2.4-r1","2.4-r2","2.4-r3","2.4-r4","2.4-r5","2.4-r6","2.4-r7","2.4-r8","2.5-r0","2.5-r1","2.5-r2","2.5-r3","2.6-r0","2.6-r1","2.6-r10","2.6-r11","2.6-r12","2.6-r13","2.6-r14","2.6-r15","2.6-r2","2.6-r3","2.6-r4","2.6-r5","2.6-r6","2.6-r7","2.6-r8","2.6-r9","2.7-r0","2.7-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-9497.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wpa_supplicant","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/wpa_supplicant?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.7-r2"}]}],"versions":["0.5.11-r0","0.6.10-r0","0.6.9-r0","0.6.9-r1","0.7.1-r0","0.7.1-r1","0.7.1-r2","0.7.2-r0","0.7.2-r1","0.7.2-r2","0.7.3-r0","0.7.3-r1","0.7.3-r2","1.0-r0","1.0-r1","1.0-r2","1.1-r0","1.1-r1","2.0-r0","2.0-r1","2.0-r2","2.0-r3","2.1-r0","2.1-r1","2.1-r2","2.2-r0","2.3-r0","2.3-r1","2.4-r0","2.4-r1","2.4-r2","2.4-r3","2.4-r4","2.4-r5","2.4-r6","2.4-r7","2.4-r8","2.5-r0","2.5-r1","2.5-r2","2.5-r3","2.6-r0","2.6-r1","2.6-r10","2.6-r11","2.6-r12","2.6-r13","2.6-r14","2.6-r15","2.6-r2","2.6-r3","2.6-r4","2.6-r5","2.6-r6","2.6-r7","2.6-r8","2.6-r9","2.7-r0","2.7-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-9497.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wpa_supplicant","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/wpa_supplicant?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.7-r2"}]}],"versions":["0.5.11-r0","0.6.10-r0","0.6.9-r0","0.6.9-r1","0.7.1-r0","0.7.1-r1","0.7.1-r2","0.7.2-r0","0.7.2-r1","0.7.2-r2","0.7.3-r0","0.7.3-r1","0.7.3-r2","1.0-r0","1.0-r1","1.0-r2","1.1-r0","1.1-r1","2.0-r0","2.0-r1","2.0-r2","2.0-r3","2.1-r0","2.1-r1","2.1-r2","2.2-r0","2.3-r0","2.3-r1","2.4-r0","2.4-r1","2.4-r2","2.4-r3","2.4-r4","2.4-r5","2.4-r6","2.4-r7","2.4-r8","2.5-r0","2.5-r1","2.5-r2","2.5-r3","2.6-r0","2.6-r1","2.6-r10","2.6-r11","2.6-r12","2.6-r13","2.6-r14","2.6-r15","2.6-r2","2.6-r3","2.6-r4","2.6-r5","2.6-r6","2.6-r7","2.6-r8","2.6-r9","2.7-r0","2.7-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2019-9497.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wpa_supplicant","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/wpa_supplicant?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.7-r2"}]}],"versions":["0.5.11-r0","0.6.10-r0","0.6.9-r0","0.6.9-r1","0.7.1-r0","0.7.1-r1","0.7.1-r2","0.7.2-r0","0.7.2-r1","0.7.2-r2","0.7.3-r0","0.7.3-r1","0.7.3-r2","1.0-r0","1.0-r1","1.0-r2","1.1-r0","1.1-r1","2.0-r0","2.0-r1","2.0-r2","2.0-r3","2.1-r0","2.1-r1","2.1-r2","2.2-r0","2.3-r0","2.3-r1","2.4-r0","2.4-r1","2.4-r2","2.4-r3
