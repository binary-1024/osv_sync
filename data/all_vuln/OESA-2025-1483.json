  "details": "The GIMP is an image composition and editing program, which can be used for creating logos and other graphics for Web pages. The GIMP offers many tools and filters, and provides a large image manipulation toolbox, including channel operations and layers, effects, subpixel imaging and antialiasing, and conversions, together with multilevel undo. The GIMP offers a scripting facility, but many of the included scripts rely on fonts that we cannot distribute.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nGIMP FLI File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of GIMP. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of FLI files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-25100.(CVE-2025-2761)",
