{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68434","published":"2025-12-17T22:20:12.925Z","modified":"2026-01-23T02:45:59.544829Z","aliases":["GHSA-wjm4-hfwg-5w5r"],"summary":"opensourcepos has Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability that leads to Unauthorized Administrator Creation","details":"Open Source Point of Sale (opensourcepos) is a web based point of sale application written in PHP using CodeIgniter framework. Starting in version 3.4.0 and prior to version 3.4.2, a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the application's filter configuration. The CSRF protection mechanism was **explicitly disabled**, allowing the application to process state-changing requests (POST) without verifying a valid CSRF token. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this by hosting a malicious web page. If a logged-in administrator visits this page, their browser is forced to send unauthorized requests to the application. A successful exploit allows the attacker to silently create a new Administrator account with full privileges, leading to a complete takeover of the system and loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The vulnerability has been patched in version 3.4.2. The fix re-enables the CSRF filter in `app/Config/Filters.php` and resolves associated AJAX race conditions by adjusting token regeneration settings. As a workaround, administrators can manually re-enable the CSRF filter in `app/Config/Filters.php` by uncommenting the protection line. However, this is not recommended without applying the full patch, as it may cause functionality breakage in the Sales module due to token synchronization issues.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d575c8da9a1d7af8313a1e758e000e243f5614ef"}]}],"versions":["2.3.1","2.3.2","2.3.3","2.3.4","2.4.0","3.0.0","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.2.3","3.3.0","3.3.1","3.3.2","3.3.3","3.3.4","3.3.5","3.3.6","3.3.7","3.3.8","3.3.9","3.4.0","3.4.1","master.3.3.5","master.3.3.6","master.3.4.0-dev"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68434.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68434.json"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/Nixon-H/CVE-2025-68434-OSPOS-CSRF-Unauthorized-Administrator-Creation"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/commit/d575c8da9a1d7af8313a1e758e000e243f5614ef"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/pull/4349"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/security/advisories/GHSA-wjm4-hfwg-5w5r"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68434"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-352"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68434.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
