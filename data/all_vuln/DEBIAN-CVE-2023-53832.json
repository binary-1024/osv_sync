After [1] recovery might be skipped and init_resync() is called but close_sync() is not. null-ptr-deref occurs with r10bio->dev[i].repl_bio.  The following is one way to reproduce the issue.    1) create a array, wait for resync to complete, mddev->recovery_cp is set      to MaxSector.   2) recovery is woken and it is skipped. conf->have_replacement is set to      0 in init_resync(). close_sync() not called.   3) some io errors and rdev A is set to WantReplacement.   4) a new device is added and set to A's replacement.   5) recovery is woken, A have replacement, but conf->have_replacemnt is      0. r10bio->dev[i].repl_bio will not be alloced and null-ptr-deref      occurs.  Fix it by not calling init_resync() if recovery skipped.
