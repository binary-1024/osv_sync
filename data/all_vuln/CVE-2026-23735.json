From 2.2.1 to before 2.4.1 and 3.1.1, when 2 or more parallel requests are made which trigger the same service, the context of the requests is mixed up in the service when the context is injected via @ExecutionContext(). ExecutionContext is often used to pass authentication tokens from incoming requests to services loading data from backend APIs. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.4.1 and 3.1.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/graphql-hive/graphql-modules","events":[{"introduced":"243c0c7bffbed538943126c0f40f12a949f1e103"},{"fixed":"b4ec020a69634f04b0bf9ebf37cd6344389d2437"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.2.1"},{"fixed":"2.4.1"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/graphql-hive/graphql-modules","events":[{"introduced":"44779659a4698b46e30d5803a152185ad045601d"},{"fixed":"accd621e2c1507a529d32a99cdfd73c576696b13"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.0.0"},{"fixed":"3.1.1"}]}}],"versions":["graphql-modules@2.2.1","graphql-modules@2.3.0","graphql-modules@2.4.0","graphql-modules@3.0.0","graphql-modules@3.1.0","release-1698934852951","release-1698998479477","release-1729678067374","release-1739961816859","release-1768574411048"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23735.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23735.json"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/graphql-hive/graphql-modules/issues/2613"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/graphql-hive/graphql-modules/pull/2521"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/graphql-hive/graphql-modules/releases/tag/release-1768575025568"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/graphql-hive/graphql-modules/security/advisories/GHSA-53wg-r69p-v3r7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23735"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-362"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23735.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
