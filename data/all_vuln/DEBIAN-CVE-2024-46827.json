  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath12k: fix firmware crash due to invalid peer nss  Currently, if the access point receives an association request containing an Extended HE Capabilities Information Element with an invalid MCS-NSS, it triggers a firmware crash.  This issue arises when EHT-PHY capabilities shows support for a bandwidth and MCS-NSS set for that particular bandwidth is filled by zeros and due to this, driver obtains peer_nss as 0 and sending this value to firmware causes crash.  Address this issue by implementing a validation step for the peer_nss value before passing it to the firmware. If the value is greater than zero, proceed with forwarding it to the firmware. However, if the value is invalid, reject the association request to prevent potential firmware crashes.  Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.0.1-00029-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1",
