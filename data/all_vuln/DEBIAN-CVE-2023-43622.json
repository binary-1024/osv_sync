This could be used to exhaust worker resources in the server, similar to the well known \"slow loris\" attack pattern. This has been fixed in version 2.4.58, so that such connection are terminated properly after the configured connection timeout.  This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.55 through 2.4.57.  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"apache2","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/apache2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.59-1~deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["2.4.48-3.1","2.4.48-3.1+deb11u1","2.4.48-4","2.4.49-1","2.4.49-1~bpo10+1","2.4.49-1~deb11u1","2.4.49-1~deb11u2","2.4.49-1~deb11u3","2.4.49-2","2.4.49-3","2.4.49-4","2.4.50-1","2.4.50-1~deb11u1","2.4.51-1","2.4.51-1~bpo10+1","2.4.51-1~bpo10+2","2.4.51-1~deb11u1","2.4.51-2","2.4.52-1","2.4.52-1~bpo10+1","2.4.52-1~deb11u1","2.4.52-1~deb11u2","2.4.52-2","2.4.52-3","2.4.53-1","2.4.53-1~deb11u1","2.4.53-2","2.4.53-2~bpo10+1","2.4.54-1","2.4.54-1~deb11u1","2.4.54-2","2.4.54-3","2.4.54-4","2.4.54-5","2.4.55-1","2.4.56-1","2.4.56-1~deb11u1","2.4.56-1~deb11u2","2.4.56-2","2.4.57-1","2.4.57-2","2.4.57-3","2.4.58-1","2.4.59-1~deb10u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-43622.json"}},{"package":{"name":"apache2","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/apache2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.59-1~deb12u1"}]}],"versions":["2.4.57-2","2.4.57-3","2.4.58-1","2.4.59-1~deb10u1","2.4.59-1~deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-43622.json"}},{"package":{"name":"apache2","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/apache2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.58-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-43622.json"}},{"package":{"name":"apache2","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/apache2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.58-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-43622.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-43622"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
