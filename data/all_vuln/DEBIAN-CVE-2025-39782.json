{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-39782","published":"2025-09-11T17:15:44.173Z","modified":"2026-01-17T11:11:05.893892Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-39782"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  jbd2: prevent softlockup in jbd2_log_do_checkpoint()  Both jbd2_log_do_checkpoint() and jbd2_journal_shrink_checkpoint_list() periodically release j_list_lock after processing a batch of buffers to avoid long hold times on the j_list_lock. However, since both functions contend for j_list_lock, the combined time spent waiting and processing can be significant.  jbd2_journal_shrink_checkpoint_list() explicitly calls cond_resched() when need_resched() is true to avoid softlockups during prolonged operations. But jbd2_log_do_checkpoint() only exits its loop when need_resched() is true, relying on potentially sleeping functions like __flush_batch() or wait_on_buffer() to trigger rescheduling. If those functions do not sleep, the kernel may hit a softlockup.  watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#3 stuck for 156s!
