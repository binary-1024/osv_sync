However, in the case of dw-hdmi, the wrong connector was being used to pass i2c adapter information, since dw-hdmi's embedded connector structure is only populated when the bridge attachment callback explicitly asks for it.  drm-meson is handling connector creation, so this won't happen, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.  Fix it by having scdc functions access dw-hdmi's current connector pointer instead, which is assigned during the bridge enablement stage.
