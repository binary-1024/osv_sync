In version 0.23.1 and possibly earlier versions, the MinerU parser contains a \"Zip Slip\" vulnerability, allowing an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the server (leading to Remote Code Execution) via a malicious ZIP archive. The MinerUParser class retrieves and extracts ZIP files from an external source (mineru_server_url). The extraction logic in `_extract_zip_no_root` fails to sanitize filenames within the ZIP archive. Commit 64c75d558e4a17a4a48953b4c201526431d8338f contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"64c75d558e4a17a4a48953b4c201526431d8338f"}]}],"versions":["nightly","v0.1.0","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.16.0","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.17.2","v0.18.0","v0.19.1","v0.19.x","v0.2.0","v0.20.0","v0.20.1","v0.20.2","v0.20.3","v0.20.4","v0.20.5","v0.21.0","v0.21.1","v0.22.0","v0.22.1","v0.23.0","v0.23.1","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24770.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24770.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/commit/64c75d558e4a17a4a48953b4c201526431d8338f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/security/advisories/GHSA-v7cf-w7gj-pgf4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24770"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-22"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24770.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
