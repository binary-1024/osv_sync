The Archery project contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases. Affected versions are subject to SQL injection in the `sql_api/api_workflow.py` endpoint `ExecuteCheck` which passes unfiltered input to the `explain_check` method in `sql/engines/oracle.py`. User input coming from the `db_name` parameter value in the `api_workflow.py` `ExecuteCheck` endpoint is passed through the `oracle.py` `execute_check` method and to the `explain_check` method for execution. Each of these issues may be mitigated by escaping user input or by using prepared statements when executing SQL queries. This issue is also indexed as `GHSL-2022-103`.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-30554.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/security/advisories/GHSA-3p43-89m6-7x5w"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-89"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
