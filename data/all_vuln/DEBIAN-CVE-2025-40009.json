This breaks an assumption made later in pagemap_scan_backout_range(), that page_region is always allocated for p->vec_buf_index.  Fix it by explicitly checking p->vec_buf for NULL before dereferencing.  Other sites that might run into same deref-issue are already (directly or transitively) protected by checking p->vec_buf.  Note: From PAGEMAP_SCAN man page, it seems vec_len = 0 is valid when no output is requested and it's only the side effects caller is interested in, hence it passes check in pagemap_scan_get_args().
