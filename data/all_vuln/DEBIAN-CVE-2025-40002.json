{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-40002","published":"2025-10-18T08:15:34Z","modified":"2025-10-19T10:32:23.492482Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-40002"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  thunderbolt: Fix use-after-free in tb_dp_dprx_work  The original code relies on cancel_delayed_work() in tb_dp_dprx_stop(), which does not ensure that the delayed work item tunnel->dprx_work has fully completed if it was already running. This leads to use-after-free scenarios where tb_tunnel is deallocated by tb_tunnel_put(), while tunnel->dprx_work remains active and attempts to dereference tb_tunnel in tb_dp_dprx_work().  A typical race condition is illustrated below:  CPU 0                            | CPU 1 tb_dp_tunnel_active()            |   tb_deactivate_and_free_tunnel()| tb_dp_dprx_start()     tb_tunnel_deactivate()       |   queue_delayed_work()       tb_dp_activate()           |         tb_dp_dprx_stop()        | tb_dp_dprx_work() //delayed worker           cancel_delayed_work()  |     tb_tunnel_put(tunnel);       |                                  |   tunnel = container_of(...); //UAF                                  |   tunnel-> //UAF  Replacing cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() is not feasible as it would introduce a deadlock: both tb_dp_dprx_work() and the cleanup path acquire tb->lock, and cancel_delayed_work_sync() would wait indefinitely for the work item that cannot proceed.  Instead, implement proper reference counting: - If cancel_delayed_work() returns true (work is pending), we release   the reference in the stop function. - If it returns false (work is executing or already completed), the   reference is released in delayed work function itself.  This ensures the tb_tunnel remains valid during work item execution while preventing memory leaks.
