Since Python 3.3, a subset of it has been integrated into the standard library under the venv module. Note though, that the venv module does not offer all features of this library (e.g. cannot create bootstrap scripts, cannot create virtual environments for other python versions than the host python, not relocatable, etc.). Tools in general as such still may prefer using virtualenv for its ease of upgrading (via pip), unified handling of different Python versions and some more advanced features.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nvirtualenv before 20.26.6 allows command injection through the activation scripts for a virtual environment. Magic template strings are not quoted correctly when replacing.
