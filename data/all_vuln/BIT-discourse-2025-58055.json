  "details": "Discourse is an open-source community discussion platform. In versions 3.5.0 and below, the Discourse AI suggestion endpoints for topic \u201cTitle\u201d, \u201cCategory\u201d, and \u201cTags\u201d allowed authenticated users to extract information about topics that they weren\u2019t authorized to access. By modifying the \u201ctopic_id\u201d value in API requests to the AI suggestion endpoints, users could target specific restricted topics. The AI model\u2019s responses then disclosed information that the authenticated user couldn\u2019t normally access. This issue is fixed in version 3.5.1. To workaround this issue, users can restrict group access to the AI helper feature through the \"composer_ai_helper_allowed_groups\" and \"post_ai_helper_allowed_groups\" site settings.",
