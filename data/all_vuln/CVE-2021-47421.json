In this case, a deadlock will happen when other threads\nstart to acquire the read lock.\n\nTo fix this, add a member in amdgpu_device strucutre to cache\npci_channel_state, and only continue the execution in amdgpu_pci_resume\nwhen it's pci_channel_io_frozen.","references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/248b061689a40f4fed05252ee2c89f87cf26d7d8"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/72e9a1bf9b722628c28092e0c2cd8717edd201dc"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/785cc093b6b5a93cc350421a55f3f1eda6585156"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
