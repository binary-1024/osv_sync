  "summary": "URL decode buffer boundary flaw",
  "details": "libcurl is vulnerable to a case of bad checking of the input data which may\n  lead to heap corruption.\n\n  The function curl_easy_unescape() decodes URL encoded strings to raw binary\n  data. URL encoded octets are represented with %HH combinations where HH is a\n  two-digit hexadecimal number. The decoded string is written to an allocated\n  memory area that the function returns to the caller.\n\n  The function takes a source string and a length parameter, and if the length\n  provided is 0 the function instead uses strlen() to figure out how much data\n  to parse.\n\n  The \"%HH\" parser wrongly only considered the case where a zero byte would\n  terminate the input. If a length-limited buffer was passed in which ended\n  with a '%' character which was followed by two hexadecimal digits outside of\n  the buffer libcurl was allowed to parse alas without a terminating zero,\n  libcurl would still parse that sequence as well. The counter for remaining\n  data to handle would then be decreased too much and wrap to become a very\n  large integer and the copying would go on too long and the destination\n  buffer that is allocated on the heap would get overwritten.\n\n  We consider it unlikely that programs allow user-provided strings unfiltered\n  into this function. Also, only the not zero-terminated input string use case\n  is affected by this flaw. Exploiting this flaw for gain is probably possible\n  for specific circumstances but we consider the general risk for this to be\n  low.\n\n  The curl command line tool is not affected by this problem as it does not\n  use this function.",
