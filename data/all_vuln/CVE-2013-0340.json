NOTE: it could be argued that because expat already provides the ability to disable external entity expansion, the responsibility for resolving this issue lies with application developers; according to this argument, this entry should be REJECTed, and each affected application would need its own CVE.","references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/22/3"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Oct/61"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Oct/62"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Oct/63"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/33"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/34"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/35"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/38"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/39"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/40"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://securitytracker.com/id?1028213"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/04/12/6"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/10/07/4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/58233"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201701-21"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212804"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212805"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212807"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212814"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212815"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212819"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.osvdb.org/90634"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r41eca5f4f09e74436cbb05dec450fc2bef37b5d3e966aa7cc5fada6d%40%3Cannounce.apache.org%3E"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rfb2c193360436e230b85547e85a41bea0916916f96c501f5b6fc4702%40%3Cusers.openoffice.apache.org%3E"}]}
