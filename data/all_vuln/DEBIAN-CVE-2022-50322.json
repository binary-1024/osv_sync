  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rtc: msc313: Fix function prototype mismatch in msc313_rtc_probe()  With clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG), indirect call targets are validated against the expected function pointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate ROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time, which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed.  msc313_rtc_probe() was passing clk_disable_unprepare() directly, which did not have matching prototypes for devm_add_action_or_reset()'s callback argument. Refactor to use devm_clk_get_enabled() instead.  This was found as a result of Clang's new -Wcast-function-type-strict flag, which is more sensitive than the simpler -Wcast-function-type, which only checks for type width mismatches.",
