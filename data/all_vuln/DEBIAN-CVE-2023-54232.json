{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-54232","published":"2025-12-30T13:16:11.623Z","modified":"2025-12-31T11:10:28.389156Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-54232"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  m68k: Only force 030 bus error if PC not in exception table  __get_kernel_nofault() does copy data in supervisor mode when forcing a task backtrace log through /proc/sysrq_trigger. This is expected cause a bus error exception on e.g. NULL pointer dereferencing when logging a kernel task has no workqueue associated. This bus error ought to be ignored.  Our 030 bus error handler is ill equipped to deal with this:  Whenever ssw indicates a kernel mode access on a data fault, we don't even attempt to handle the fault and instead always send a SEGV signal (or panic). As a result, the check for exception handling at the fault PC (buried in send_sig_fault() which gets called from do_page_fault() eventually) is never used.  In contrast, both 040 and 060 access error handlers do not care whether a fault happened on supervisor mode access, and will call do_page_fault() on those, ultimately honoring the exception table.  Add a check in bus_error030 to call do_page_fault() in case we do have an entry for the fault PC in our exception table.  I had attempted a fix for this earlier in 2019 that did rely on testing pagefault_disabled() (see link below) to achieve the same thing, but this patch should be more generic.  Tested on 030 Atari Falcon.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.178-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.103-1","5.10.103-1~bpo10+1","5.10.106-1","5.10.113-1","5.10.120-1","5.10.120-1~bpo10+1","5.10.127-1","5.10.127-2","5.10.127-2~bpo10+1","5.10.136-1","5.10.140-1","5.10.148-1","5.10.149-1","5.10.149-2","5.10.158-1","5.10.158-2","5.10.162-1","5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1","5.10.92-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-54232.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.25-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-54232.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.25-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-54232.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.25-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-54232.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-54232"}]}
