{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-54251","published":"2025-12-30T13:16:13.763Z","modified":"2025-12-31T11:10:32.219036Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-54251"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/sched: taprio: Limit TCA_TAPRIO_ATTR_SCHED_CYCLE_TIME to INT_MAX.  syzkaller found zero division error [0] in div_s64_rem() called from get_cycle_time_elapsed(), where sched->cycle_time is the divisor.  We have tests in parse_taprio_schedule() so that cycle_time will never be 0, and actually cycle_time is not 0 in get_cycle_time_elapsed().  The problem is that the types of divisor are different; cycle_time is s64, but the argument of div_s64_rem() is s32.  syzkaller fed this input and 0x100000000 is cast to s32 to be 0.    @TCA_TAPRIO_ATTR_SCHED_CYCLE_TIME={0xc, 0x8, 0x100000000}  We use s64 for cycle_time to cast it to ktime_t, so let's keep it and set max for cycle_time.  While at it, we prevent overflow in setup_txtime() and add another test in parse_taprio_schedule() to check if cycle_time overflows.  Also, we add a new tdc test case for this issue.
