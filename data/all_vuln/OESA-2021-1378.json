A remote attacker could exploit this flaw by providing a malicious PDF file that, when processed by the &apos;pdftohtml&apos; program, would crash the application causing a denial of service.(CVE-2020-27778)\r\n\r\nIn Poppler through 0.76.1, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in JPXStream::init in JPEG2000Stream.cc via data with inconsistent heights or widths.(CVE-2019-12293)",
