In both functions, the 'dc_dmub_srv' variable was being dereferenced before it was checked for null. This could lead to a null pointer dereference if 'dc_dmub_srv' is null. The fix is to check if 'dc_dmub_srv' is null before dereferencing it.  Thus moving the null checks for 'dc_dmub_srv' to the beginning of the functions to ensure that 'dc_dmub_srv' is not null when it is dereferenced.
