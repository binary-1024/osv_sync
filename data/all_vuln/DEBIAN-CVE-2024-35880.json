  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/kbuf: hold io_buffer_list reference over mmap  If we look up the kbuf, ensure that it doesn't get unregistered until after we're done with it. Since we're inside mmap, we cannot safely use the io_uring lock. Rely on the fact that we can lookup the buffer list under RCU now and grab a reference to it, preventing it from being unregistered until we're done with it. The lookup returns the io_buffer_list directly with it referenced.",
