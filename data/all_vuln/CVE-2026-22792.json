{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-22792","published":"2026-01-21T20:54:18.108Z","modified":"2026-01-30T22:53:30.711700Z","aliases":["GHSA-p5fm-wm8g-rffx"],"summary":"5ire vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE)","details":"5ire is a cross-platform desktop artificial intelligence assistant and model context protocol client. Prior to version 0.15.3, an unsafe HTML rendering permits untrusted HTML (including on* event attributes) to execute in the renderer context. An attacker can inject an `<img onerror=...>` payload to run arbitrary JavaScript in the renderer, which can call exposed bridge APIs such as `window.bridge.mcpServersManager.createServer`. This enables unauthorized creation of MCP servers and lead to remote command execution. Version 0.15.3 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5acf7edc387d1f18a00555bbd1f5d9b9718d2eaa"}]}],"versions":["v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.11.2","v0.11.3","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.13.2","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.15.2","v0.7.9","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.8.4","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v0.9.4","v0.9.5","v0.9.6","v0.9.7","v0.9.8","v0.9.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22792.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22792.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire/releases/tag/v0.15.3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire/security/advisories/GHSA-p5fm-wm8g-rffx"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22792"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-116"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22792.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
