  "details": "The mod_jk component of Apache Tomcat Connectors in some circumstances,\nsuch as when a configuration included \"JkOptions +ForwardDirectories\"\nbut the configuration did not provide explicit mounts for all possible\nproxied requests, mod_jk would use an implicit mapping and map the\nrequest to the first defined worker. Such an implicit mapping could\nresult in the unintended exposure of the status worker and/or bypass\nsecurity constraints configured in httpd. As of JK 1.2.49, the implicit\nmapping functionality has been removed and all mappings must now be via\nexplicit configuration. (CVE-2023-41081)\n",
