{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53781","published":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","modified":"2025-12-09T07:18:53.477586Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-53781"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smc: Fix use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler().  With Eric's ref tracker, syzbot finally found a repro for use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler() by kernel TCP sockets. [0]  If SMC creates a kernel socket in __smc_create(), the kernel socket is supposed to be freed in smc_clcsock_release() by calling sock_release() when we close() the parent SMC socket.  However, at the end of smc_clcsock_release(), the kernel socket's sk_state might not be TCP_CLOSE.  This means that we have not called inet_csk_destroy_sock() in __tcp_close() and have not stopped the TCP timers.  The kernel socket's TCP timers can be fired later, so we need to hold a refcnt for net as we do for MPTCP subflows in mptcp_subflow_create_socket().
