This occurs in Dict::lookup, Catalog::getMetadata, and associated functions in PDFDoc, with deep recursion in the regex executor (std::__detail::_Executor).(CVE-2025-43718)\n\nPoppler is a library for rendering PDF files, and examining or modifying their structure. A use-after-free (write) vulnerability has been detected in versions Poppler prior to 25.10.0 within the StructTreeRoot class. The issue arises from the use of raw pointers to elements of a `std::vector`, which can lead to dangling pointers when the vector is resized. The vulnerability stems from the way that refToParentMap stores references to `std::vector` elements using raw pointers. These pointers may become invalid when the vector is resized. This vulnerability is a common security problem involving the use of raw pointers to `std::vectors`. Internally, `std::vector` stores its elements in a dynamically allocated array. When the array reaches its capacity and a new element is added, the vector reallocates a larger block of memory and moves all the existing elements to the new location. At this point if any pointers to elements are stored before a resize occurs, they become dangling pointers once the reallocation happens. Version 25.10.0 contains a patch for the issue.(CVE-2025-52885)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"poppler","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/poppler&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["poppler-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","poppler-cpp-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","poppler-cpp-devel-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","poppler-debuginfo-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","poppler-debugsource-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","poppler-devel-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","poppler-glib-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","poppler-glib-devel-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","poppler-qt5-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","poppler-qt5-devel-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm","poppler-utils-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["poppler-glib-doc-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.noarch.rpm","poppler-help-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.noarch.rpm"],"src":["poppler-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["poppler-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","poppler-cpp-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","poppler-cpp-devel-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","poppler-debuginfo-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","poppler-debugsource-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","poppler-devel-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","poppler-glib-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","poppler-glib-devel-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","poppler-qt5-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","poppler-qt5-devel-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm","poppler-utils-0.90.0-15.oe2203sp3.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2484.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2484"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-43718"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-52885"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
