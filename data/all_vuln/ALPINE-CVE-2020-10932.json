{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2020-10932","published":"2020-04-15T14:15:20.123Z","modified":"2025-11-19T06:16:57.292776Z","upstream":["CVE-2020-10932"],"details":"An issue was discovered in Arm Mbed TLS before 2.16.6 and 2.7.x before 2.7.15. An attacker that can get precise enough side-channel measurements can recover the long-term ECDSA private key by (1) reconstructing the projective coordinate of the result of scalar multiplication by exploiting side channels in the conversion to affine coordinates; (2) using an attack described by Naccache, Smart, and Stern in 2003 to recover a few bits of the ephemeral scalar from those projective coordinates via several measurements; and (3) using a lattice attack to get from there to the long-term ECDSA private key used for the signatures. Typically an attacker would have sufficient access when attacking an SGX enclave and controlling the untrusted OS.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.10","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.16.6-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.5-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-10932.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.11","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.16.6-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-10932.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.16.6-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-10932.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.16.6-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-10932.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.16.6-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-10932.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.16.6-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-10932.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.16.6-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-10932.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.16.6-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-10932.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.16.6-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"
