The tplg_decode_control_mixer1() function reads the num_channels field from untrusted .tplg data and uses it as a loop bound without validating it against the fixed-size channel array (SND_TPLG_MAX_CHAN). A crafted topology file with an excessive num_channels value can cause out-of-bounds heap writes, leading to a crash.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"alsa-lib","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/alsa-lib?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.10-1","1.2.10-2","1.2.10-3","1.2.10-3.1","1.2.10-3.1~exp1","1.2.10-3.1~exp2","1.2.10-3.2","1.2.11-1","1.2.12-1","1.2.13-1","1.2.14-1","1.2.14-2","1.2.15-1","1.2.15-2","1.2.15.1-1","1.2.15.3-1","1.2.4-1.1","1.2.5.1-1","1.2.6.1-1","1.2.6.1-2","1.2.7.1-1","1.2.7.2-1","1.2.8-1","1.2.9-1","1.2.9-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-25068.json"}},{"package":{"name":"alsa-lib","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/alsa-lib?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.10-1","1.2.10-2","1.2.10-3","1.2.10-3.1","1.2.10-3.1~exp1","1.2.10-3.1~exp2","1.2.10-3.2","1.2.11-1","1.2.12-1","1.2.13-1","1.2.14-1","1.2.14-2","1.2.15-1","1.2.15-2","1.2.15.1-1","1.2.15.3-1","1.2.8-1","1.2.9-1","1.2.9-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-25068.json"}},{"package":{"name":"alsa-lib","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/alsa-lib?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.14-1","1.2.14-2","1.2.15-1","1.2.15-2","1.2.15.1-1","1.2.15.3-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-25068.json"}},{"package":{"name":"alsa-lib","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/alsa-lib?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.14-1","1.2.14-2","1.2.15-1","1.2.15-2","1.2.15.1-1","1.2.15.3-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-25068.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2026-25068"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
