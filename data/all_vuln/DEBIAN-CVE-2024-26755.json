Meanwhile, there is a potential deadlock for raid456:  1) reshape is interrupted;  2) set one of the disk WantReplacement, and add a new disk to the array,    however, recovery won't start until the reshape is finished;  3) then issue an IO across reshpae position, this IO will wait for    reshape to make progress;  4) continue to reshape, then md_start_sync() found there is a spare disk    that can be added to conf, mddev_suspend() is called;  Step 4 and step 3 is waiting for each other, deadlock triggered. Noted this problem is found by code review, and it's not reporduced yet.  Fix this porblem by don't suspend the array for interrupted reshape, this is safe because conf won't be changed until reshape is done.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.7.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-26755.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.7.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-26755.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-26755"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
