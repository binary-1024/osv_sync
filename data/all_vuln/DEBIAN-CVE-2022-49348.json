{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49348","published":"2025-02-26T07:01:11Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:57:29.907836Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-49348"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: filter out EXT4_FC_REPLAY from on-disk superblock field s_state  The EXT4_FC_REPLAY bit in sbi->s_mount_state is used to indicate that we are in the middle of replay the fast commit journal.  This was actually a mistake, since the sbi->s_mount_info is initialized from es->s_state.  Arguably s_mount_state is misleadingly named, but the name is historical --- s_mount_state and s_state dates back to ext2.  What should have been used is the ext4_{set,clear,test}_mount_flag() inline functions, which sets EXT4_MF_* bits in sbi->s_mount_flags.  The problem with using EXT4_FC_REPLAY is that a maliciously corrupted superblock could result in EXT4_FC_REPLAY getting set in s_mount_state.  This bypasses some sanity checks, and this can trigger a BUG() in ext4_es_cache_extent().  As a easy-to-backport-fix, filter out the EXT4_FC_REPLAY bit for now.  We should eventually transition away from EXT4_FC_REPLAY to something like EXT4_MF_REPLAY.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.127-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.103-1","5.10.103-1~bpo10+1","5.10.106-1","5.10.113-1","5.10.120-1","5.10.120-1~bpo10+1","5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1","5.10.92-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49348.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49348.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49348.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.18.5-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49348.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-49348"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
