{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-25050","published":"2026-01-30T15:11:40.296Z","modified":"2026-01-30T20:11:33.086888Z","aliases":["GHSA-6f65-4fv2-wwch"],"summary":"Vendure vulnerable to timing attack that enables user enumeration in NativeAuthenticationStrategy","details":"Vendure is an open-source headless commerce platform. Prior to version 3.5.3, the `NativeAuthenticationStrategy.authenticate()` method is vulnerable to a timing attack that allows attackers to enumerate valid usernames (email addresses). In `packages/core/src/config/auth/native-authentication-strategy.ts`, the authenticate method returns immediately if a user is not found. The significant timing difference (~200-400ms for bcrypt vs ~1-5ms for DB miss) allows attackers to reliably distinguish between existing and non-existing accounts. Version 3.5.3 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vendurehq/vendure","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b3d8ad0ece67bf26dc6a056b8a659cc05e743c15"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.5.3"}]}}],"versions":["0.1.0-alpha.10","0.1.0-alpha.11","0.1.0-alpha.12","0.1.0-alpha.13","0.1.0-alpha.14","0.1.0-alpha.15","0.1.0-alpha.16","0.1.0-alpha.18","0.1.0-alpha.3","0.1.0-alpha.4","0.1.0-alpha.5","0.1.0-alpha.6","0.1.0-alpha.7","0.1.0-alpha.8","0.1.0-alpha.9","v0.1.2-beta.0","v0.1.2-beta.1","v0.1.2-beta.10","v0.1.2-beta.11","v0.1.2-beta.12","v0.1.2-beta.2","v0.1.2-beta.3","v0.1.2-beta.4","v0.1.2-beta.5","v0.1.2-beta.6","v0.1.2-beta.7","v0.1.2-beta.8","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.12.1","v0.12.2","v0.12.3","v0.12.4","v0.12.5","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.15.2","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.16.2","v0.16.3","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.17.2","v0.17.3","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.18.2","v0.18.3","v0.18.4","v0.18.5","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.4","v0.6.5","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.9.0","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-beta.1","v1.0.0-beta.10","v1.0.0-beta.11","v1.0.0-beta.2","v1.0.0-beta.3","v1.0.0-beta.4","v1.0.0-beta.5","v1.0.0-beta.6","v1.0.0-beta.7","v1.0.0-beta.8","v1.0.0-beta.9","v1.0.0-rc.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.3.0","v1.3.0-beta.0","v1.3.0-beta.1","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.4.0","v1.4.0-beta.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.4.6","v1.4.7","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.6.5","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.7.4","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.8.3","v1.8.4","v1.8.5","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v1.9.3","v1.9.4","v1.9.5","v1.9.6","v1.9.7","v1.x","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-beta.0","v2.0.0-beta.1","v2.0.0-beta.2","v2.0.0-beta.3","v2.0.0-next.0","v2.0.0-next.1","v2.0.0-next.10","v2.0.0-next.11","v2.0.0-next.12","v2.0.0-next.13","v2.0.0-next.14","v2.0.0-next.15","v2.0.0-next.16","v2.0.0-next.17","v2.0.0-next.18","v2.0.0-next.19","v2.0.0-next.2","v2.0.0-next.20","v2.0.0-next.21","v2.0.0-next.22","v2.0.0-next.23","v2.0.0-next.24","v2.0.0-next.25","v2.0.0-next.26","v2.0.0-next.27","v2.0.0-next.28","v2.0.0-next.3","v2.0.0-next.4","v2.0.0-next.5","v2.0.0-next.6","v2.0.0-next.7","v2.0.0-next.8","v2.0.0-next.9","v2.0.1","v2.0.10","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.0.6","v2.0.7","v2.0.8","v2.0.9","v2.1.0","v2.1.0-next.0","v2.1.0-next.1","v2.1.0-next.2","v2.1.0-next.3","v2.1.0-next.4","v2.1.0-next.5","v2.1.0-next.6","v2.1.0-next.7","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.1.4","v2.1.5","v2.1.6","v2.1.7","v2.1.8","v2.1.9","v2.2.0","v2.2.0-next.0","v2.2.0-next.1","v2.2.0-next.2","v2.2.0-next.3","v2.2.0-next.4","v2.2.0-next.5","v2.2.0-next.6","v2.2.0-next.7","v2.2.0-next.8","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.2.3","v2.2.4","v2.2.5","v2.2.6","v2.2.7","v2.3.0","v3.0.0","v3.0.0-next.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.5","v3.0.6","v3.0.7","v3.0.8","v3.1.0","v3.1.0-next.0","v3.1.0-next.1","v3.1.0-next.2","v3.1.0-next.3","v3.1.0-next.4","v3.1.1","v3.1.2","v3.1.3","v3.1.4","v3.1.5","v3.1.6","v3.1.7","v3.1.8","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.2.2","v3.2.3","v3.2.4","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.3.2","v3.3.3","v3.3.4","v3.3.5","v3.3.6","v3.3.7","v3.3.8","v3.4.0","v3.4.1","v3.4.2","v3.4.3","v3.4.4","v3.5.0","v3.5.1","v3.5.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-25050.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/25xxx/CVE-2026-25050.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vendurehq/vendure/releases/tag/v3.5.3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/vendurehq/vendure/security/advisories/GHSA-6f65-4fv2-wwch"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-25050"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-202"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/25xxx/CVE-2026-25050.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
