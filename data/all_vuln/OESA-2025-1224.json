This mishandling could leave a client connection in an invalid state, where the next request sent on the connection will fail. An attacker sending a request to a net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy proxy can exploit this mishandling to cause a denial of service by sending  Expect: 100-continue  requests which elicit a non-informational response from the backend. Each such request leaves the proxy with an invalid connection, and causes one subsequent request using that connection to fail.(CVE-2024-24791)\n\nThe HTTP client drops sensitive headers after following a cross-domain redirect. For example, a request to a.com/ containing an Authorization header which is redirected to b.com/ will not send that header to b.com. In the event that the client received a subsequent same-domain redirect, however, the sensitive headers would be restored. For example, a chain of redirects from a.com/, to b.com/1, and finally to b.com/2 would incorrectly send the Authorization header to b.com/2.(CVE-2024-45336)\n\nA certificate with a URI which has a IPv6 address with a zone ID may incorrectly satisfy a URI name constraint that applies to the certificate chain. Certificates containing URIs are not permitted in the web PKI, so this only affects users of private PKIs which make use of URIs.(CVE-2024-45341)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"golang","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/golang&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.21.4-31.oe2403sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["golang-1.21.4-31.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["golang-devel-1.21.4-31.oe2403sp1.noarch.rpm","golang-help-1.21.4-31.oe2403sp1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["golang-1.21.4-31.oe2403sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["golang-1.21.4-31.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1224.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-1224"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24791"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45336"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45341"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
