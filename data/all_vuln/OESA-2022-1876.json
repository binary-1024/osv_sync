  "details": "SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained,high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. SQLite is the most used database engine in the world. SQLite is built into all mobile phones and most computers and comes bundled inside countless other applications that people use every day.It also include lemon and sqlite3_analyzer and tcl tools.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn issue was found in fts5UnicodeTokenize() in ext/fts5/fts5_tokenize.c in Sqlite. A unicode61 tokenizer configured to treat unicode &quot;control-characters&quot; (class Cc), was treating embedded nul characters as tokens. The issue was fixed in sqlite-3.34.0 and later.(CVE-2021-20223)",
