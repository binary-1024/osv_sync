If an attacker manages to exhaust the heap space, this error is not detected and may lead to libssh using a partially initialized cipher context. This occurs because the OpenSSL error code returned aliases with the SSH_OK code, resulting in libssh not properly detecting the error returned by the OpenSSL library. This issue can lead to undefined behavior, including compromised data confidentiality and integrity or crashes.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:24.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libssh@0.10.6-2ubuntu0.1?arch=source&distro=noble"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.10.6-2ubuntu0.1"}]}],"versions":["0.10.5-3ubuntu1","0.10.5-3ubuntu2","0.10.6-2","0.10.6-2build1","0.10.6-2build2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"libssh-4","binary_version":"0.10.6-2ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"libssh-dev","binary_version":"0.10.6-2ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"libssh-gcrypt-4","binary_version":"0.10.6-2ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"libssh-gcrypt-dev","binary_version":"0.10.6-2ubuntu0.1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-5987.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libssh","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.04","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libssh@0.11.1-1ubuntu0.1?arch=source&distro=plucky"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.11.1-1ubuntu0.1"}]}],"versions":["0.10.6-3ubuntu1","0.11.1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"availability":"No subscription required","binaries":[{"binary_name":"libssh-4","binary_version":"0.11.1-1ubuntu0.1"},{"binary_name":"libssh-dev","binary_version":"0.11.1-1ubuntu0.1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-5987.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-5987"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-5987"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.libssh.org/security/advisories/CVE-2025-5987.txt"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7619-1"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
