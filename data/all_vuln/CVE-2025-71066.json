It leads to UAF on `struct Qdisc` object.\nAttacker requires the capability to create new user and network namespace\nin order to trigger the bug.\nSee my additional commentary at the end of the analysis.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nstatic int ets_qdisc_change(struct Qdisc *sch, struct nlattr *opt,\n                          struct netlink_ext_ack *extack)\n{\n...\n\n      // (1) this lock is preventing .change handler (`ets_qdisc_change`)\n      //to race with .dequeue handler (`ets_qdisc_dequeue`)\n      sch_tree_lock(sch);\n\n      for (i = nbands; i < oldbands; i++) {\n              if (i >= q->nstrict && q->classes[i].qdisc->q.qlen)\n                      list_del_init(&q->classes[i].alist);\n              qdisc_purge_queue(q->classes[i].qdisc);\n      }\n\n      WRITE_ONCE(q->nbands, nbands);\n      for (i = nstrict; i < q->nstrict; i++) {\n              if (q->classes[i].qdisc->q.qlen) {\n\t\t      // (2) the class is added to the q->active\n                      list_add_tail(&q->classes[i].alist, &q->active);\n                      q->classes[i].deficit = quanta[i];\n              }\n      }\n      WRITE_ONCE(q->nstrict, nstrict);\n      memcpy(q->prio2band, priomap, sizeof(priomap));\n\n      for (i = 0; i < q->nbands; i++)\n              WRITE_ONCE(q->classes[i].quantum, quanta[i]);\n\n      for (i = oldbands; i < q->nbands; i++) {\n              q->classes[i].qdisc = queues[i];\n              if (q->classes[i].qdisc != &noop_qdisc)\n                      qdisc_hash_add(q->classes[i].qdisc, true);\n      }\n\n      // (3) the qdisc is unlocked, now dequeue can be called in parallel\n      // to the rest of .change handler\n      sch_tree_unlock(sch);\n\n      ets_offload_change(sch);\n      for (i = q->nbands; i < oldbands; i++) {\n\t      // (4) we're reducing the refcount for our class's qdisc and\n\t      //  freeing it\n              qdisc_put(q->classes[i].qdisc);\n\t      // (5) If we call .dequeue between (4) and (5), we will have\n\t      // a strong UAF and we can control RIP\n              q->classes[i].qdisc = NULL;\n              WRITE_ONCE(q->classes[i].quantum, 0);\n              q->classes[i].deficit = 0;\n              gnet_stats_basic_sync_init(&q->classes[i].bstats);\n              memset(&q->classes[i].qstats, 0, sizeof(q->classes[i].qstats));\n      }\n      return 0;\n}\n\nComment:\nThis happens because some of the classes have their qdiscs assigned to\nNULL, but remain in the active list. This commit fixes this issue by always\nremoving the class from the active list before deleting and freeing its\nassociated qdisc\n\nReproducer Steps\n(trimmed version of what was sent by
