{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-29206","published":"2023-04-15T15:41:56.041Z","modified":"2025-12-12T02:55:42.618155Z","aliases":["GHSA-cmvg-w72j-7phx"],"summary":"org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-skin-skinx vulnerable to basic Cross-site Scripting by exploiting JSX or SSX plugins","details":"XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. There was no check in the author of a JavaScript xobject or StyleSheet xobject added in a XWiki document, so until now it was possible for a user having only Edit Right to create such object and to craft a script allowing to perform some operations when executing by a user with appropriate rights. This has been patched in XWiki 14.9-rc-1 by only executing the script if the author of it has Script rights.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"6b4e02c0b1a36391ca47775187fc52cfc00cf6fd"},{"last_affected":"8493d664223e31da8307d1718775921422af4152"},{"last_affected":"c1a01b2f09def06d3a950990242ebcbe39bd96cc"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-29206.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"729a4bf9e5dfc1e3a79b5120eca8147a5715ff8f"},{"last_affected":"75c1bed0bf998a62cd9464d5070b0984dae1a04a"},{"last_affected":"dbd71a4af7eb229ad72acd336f73aab9da2a1856"},{"last_affected":"fe23880b006d0a4a686600a82d5663cbfcf3150e"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-29206.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/29xxx/CVE-2023-29206.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/fe65bc35d5672dd2505b7ac4ec42aec57d500fbb"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-cmvg-w72j-7phx"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19514"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19583"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9119"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29206"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/29xxx/CVE-2023-29206.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
