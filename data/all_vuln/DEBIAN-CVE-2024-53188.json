  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath12k: fix crash when unbinding  If there is an error during some initialization related to firmware, the function ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup is called to release resources. However this is released again when the device is unbinded (ath12k_pci), and we get: BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000020 at RIP: 0010:ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup.part.0+0xb6/0x500 [ath12k] Call Trace: ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup ath12k_dp_free ath12k_core_deinit ath12k_pci_remove ...  The issue is always reproducible from a VM because the MSI addressing initialization is failing.  In order to fix the issue, just set to NULL the released structure in ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup at the end.",
