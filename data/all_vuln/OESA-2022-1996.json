In this mode, QEMU emulates a full system (for example a PC),\n\t\tincluding one or several processors and various peripherals. It can be used to launch\n\t\tdifferent Operating Systems without rebooting the PC or to debug system code.\n\n\t\tUser mode emulation. In this mode, QEMU can launch processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU.\n\t\tIt can be used to launch the Wine Windows API emulator (https://www.winehq.org) or to ease\n\t\tcross-compilation and cross-debugging.\n\t\tYou can refer to https://www.qemu.org for more infortmation.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the ATI VGA device emulation of QEMU. This flaw occurs in the ati_2d_blt() routine while handling MMIO write operations when the guest provides invalid values for the destination display parameters. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service.(CVE-2021-3638)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"qemu","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/qemu&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.1.0-75.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["qemu-img-4.1.0-75.oe1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-block-iscsi-4.1.0-75.oe1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-block-rbd-4.1.0-75.oe1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-debuginfo-4.1.0-75.oe1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-4.1.0-75.oe1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-debugsource-4.1.0-75.oe1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-block-curl-4.1.0-75.oe1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-guest-agent-4.1.0-75.oe1.aarch64.rpm","qemu-block-ssh-4.1.0-75.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["qemu-help-4.1.0-75.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["qemu-4.1.0-75.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["qemu-guest-agent-4.1.0-75.oe1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-img-4.1.0-75.oe1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-4.1.0-75.oe1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-block-iscsi-4.1.0-75.oe1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-block-curl-4.1.0-75.oe1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-debuginfo-4.1.0-75.oe1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-seabios-4.1.0-75.oe1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-block-rbd-4.1.0-75.oe1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-debugsource-4.1.0-75.oe1.x86_64.rpm","qemu-block-ssh-4.1.0-75.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1996.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2022-1996"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3638"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
