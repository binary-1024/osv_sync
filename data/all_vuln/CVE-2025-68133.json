{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68133","published":"2026-01-21T02:25:03.085Z","modified":"2026-01-22T05:51:50.507753Z","aliases":["GHSA-mv3w-pp85-5h7c"],"summary":"EVerest's unlimited connections can lead to DoS through operating system resource exhaustion","details":"EVerest is an EV charging software stack. In versions 2025.9.0 and below, an attacker can exhaust the operating system's memory and cause the module to terminate by initiating an unlimited number of TCP connections that never proceed to ISO 15118-2 communication. This is possible because a new thread is started for each incoming plain TCP or TLS socket connection before any verification occurs, and the verification performed is too permissive. The EVerest processes and all its modules shut down, affecting all EVSE functionality. This issue is fixed in version 2025.10.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/everest/everest-core","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c86cd9c0ada60b5797f574fd484eae4d8330017d"}]}],"versions":["2022.12.0","2022.12.1","2023.1.0","2023.10.0","2023.12.0","2023.2.0","2023.2.1","2023.3.0","2023.5.0","2023.6.0","2023.7.0","2023.8.0","2023.9.0","2023.9.1","2024.1.0","2024.10.0","2024.11.0","2024.2.0","2024.3.0-rc1","2024.4.0","2024.5.0","2024.6.0-rc1","2024.6.0-rc2","2024.7.0","2024.7.1","2024.8.0","2024.9.0-rc1","2025.1.0-rc1","2025.1.0-rc2","2025.2.0","2025.3.0","2025.4.0-rc1","2025.5.0","2025.6.0","2025.7.0","2025.7.0-rc1","2025.8.0","2025.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68133.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["243003712789178062503146303338281965718","28960150712886505085483741986671241515","168243888782963850779708053776925040017","301503089711335497483477796302426921625","266559291961740525977226234582463159260","14112705696940663726721188972121718934","229722161894950827463204315700879441599","171855750029820596888200642603912303410","1847160579080647096042318630878208024"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2025-68133-aed155c7","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/everest/everest-core/commit/c86cd9c0ada60b5797f574fd484eae4d8330017d","target":{"file":"modules/EVSE/Auth/tests/auth_tests.cpp"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"274524476206042087287404301418060636027","length":1807},"id":"CVE-2025-68133-e210278c","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/everest/everest-core/commit/c86cd9c0ada60b5797f574fd484eae4d8330017d","target":{"file":"modules/EVSE/Auth/tests/auth_tests.cpp","function":"TEST_F"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68133.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core/commit/8127b8c54b296c4dd01b356ac26763f81f76a8fd"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core/commit/de504f0c11069010d26767b0952739e9a400cef3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core/security/advisories/GHSA-mv3w-pp85-5h7c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68133"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-770"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68133.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
