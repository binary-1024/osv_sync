PV guests can request two forms of mappings. When both are in use for any individual mapping, unmapping of such a mapping can be requested in two steps. The reference count for such a mapping would then mistakenly be decremented twice. Underflow of the counters gets detected, resulting in the triggering of a hypervisor bug check.","references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/01/25/3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-23"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5117"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-394.txt"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OMR6UBGJW6JKND7IILGQ2CU35EQPF3E3/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
