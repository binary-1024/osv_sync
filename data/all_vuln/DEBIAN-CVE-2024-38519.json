{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-38519","published":"2024-07-02T14:15:13Z","modified":"2025-10-14T04:26:34.678374Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-38519"],"details":"`yt-dlp` and `youtube-dl` are command-line audio/video downloaders. Prior to the fixed versions, `yt-dlp` and `youtube-dl` do not limit the extensions of downloaded files, which could lead to arbitrary filenames being created in the download folder (and path traversal on Windows). Since `yt-dlp` and `youtube-dl` also read config from the working directory (and on Windows executables will be executed from the `yt-dlp` or `youtube-dl` directory), this could lead to arbitrary code being executed.     `yt-dlp` version 2024.07.01 fixes this issue by whitelisting the allowed extensions. `youtube-dl` fixes this issue in commit `d42a222` on the `master` branch and in nightly builds tagged 2024-07-03 or later. This might mean some very uncommon extensions might not get downloaded, however it will also limit the possible exploitation surface. In addition to upgrading, have `.%(ext)s` at the end of the output template and make sure the user trusts the websites that they are downloading from. Also, make sure to never download to a directory within PATH or other sensitive locations like one's user directory, `system32`, or other binaries locations. For users who are not able to upgrade, keep the default output template (`-o \"%(title)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s`); make sure the extension of the media to download is a common video/audio/sub/... one; try to avoid the generic extractor; and/or use `--ignore-config --config-location ...` to not load config from common locations.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"youtube-dl","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/youtube-dl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2021.06.06-1","2021.12.17-1","2021.12.17-1~bpo11+1","2021.12.17-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-38519.json"}},{"package":{"name":"youtube-dl","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/youtube-dl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2021.12.17-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-38519.json"}},{"package":{"name":"yt-dlp","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/yt-dlp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2023.03.04-1","2023.06.21-1","2023.06.22-1","2023.06.22-1~bpo12+1","2023.07.06-1","2023.07.06-1~bpo12+1","2023.09.24-1","2023.09.24-2","2023.09.24-2~bpo12+1","2023.10.07-1","2023.10.07-1~bpo12+1","2023.10.13-1","2023.10.13-1~bpo11+1","2023.10.13-1~bpo12+1","2023.11.16-1","2023.11.16-1~bpo11+1","2023.11.16-1~bpo12+1","2023.12.30-1","2024.03.10-1","2024.03.10-1~bpo12+1","2024.04.09-1","2024.04.09-1~bpo12+1","2024.05.26-1","2024.05.26-1~bpo12+1","2024.05.27-1","2024.05.27-1~bpo12+1","2024.07.01-1","2024.07.02-1","2024.07.02-1~bpo12+1","2024.07.07-1","2024.07.09-1","2024.07.09-1~bpo12+1","2024.07.16-1","2024.07.16-1~bpo12+1","2024.07.25-1","2024.07.25-1~bpo12+1","2024.08.01-1","2024.08.01-1~bpo12+1","2024.08.06-1","2024.08.06-1~bpo12+1","2024.09.27-1","2024.09.27-1~bpo12+1","2024.10.07-1","2024.10.07-1~bpo12+1","2024.10.22-1","2024.10.22-1~bpo12+1","2024.11.04-1","2024.11.18-1","2024.11.18-1~bpo12+1","2024.12.03-1","2024.12.03-1~bpo12+1","2024.12.06-1","2024.12.06-1~bpo12+1","2024.12.13-1","2024.12.13-1~bpo12+1","2024.12.23-1","2024.12.23-1~bpo12+1","2025.01.12-1","2025.01.12-1~bpo12+1","2025.01.15-1","2025.01.15-1~bpo12+1","2025.01.26-1","2025.01.26-1~bpo12+1","2025.02.19-1","2025.02.19-1~bpo12+1","2025.03.21-1","2025.03.21-1~bpo12+1","2025.03.25-1","2025.03.26-1","2025.03.26-1~bpo12+1","2025.03.27-1","2025.03.27-1~bpo12+1","2025.03.31-1","2025.03.31-1~bpo12+1","2025.04.30-1","2025.04.30-1~bpo12+1","2025.05.22-1","2025.06.09-1","2025.06.25-1","2025.06.30-1","2025.07.21-1","2025.08.11-1","2025.08.11-1~bpo13+1","2025.08.20-1","2025.08.22-1","2025.08.27-1","2025.08.27-1~bpo13+1","2025.09.05-1","2025.09.05-1~bpo13+1","2025.09.23-1","2025.09.26-1","2025.09.26-1~bpo13+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-38519.json"}},{"package":{"name":"yt-dlp","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/yt-dlp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2024.07.01-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-38519.json"}},{"package":{"name":"yt-dlp","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/yt-dlp?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2024.07.01-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-38519.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-38519"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
