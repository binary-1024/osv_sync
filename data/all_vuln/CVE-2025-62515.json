{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-62515","published":"2025-10-17T20:38:43Z","modified":"2025-10-21T02:36:37Z","aliases":["GHSA-f74j-gffq-vm9p"],"summary":"Remote Code Execution by Pickle Deserialization via FlightServer in pyquokka","details":"pyquokka is a framework for making data lakes work for time series. In versions 0.3.1 and prior, the FlightServer class directly uses pickle.loads() to deserialize action bodies received from Flight clients without any sanitization or validation in the do_action() method. The vulnerable code is located in pyquokka/flight.py at line 283 where arbitrary data from Flight clients is directly passed to pickle.loads(). When FlightServer is configured to listen on 0.0.0.0, this allows attackers across the entire network to perform arbitrary remote code execution by sending malicious pickled payloads through the set_configs action. Additional vulnerability points exist in the cache_garbage_collect, do_put, and do_get functions where pickle.loads is used to deserialize untrusted remote data.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62515.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"3.0.1"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/marsupialtail/quokka/security/advisories/GHSA-f74j-gffq-vm9p"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
