An attacker who can create or rename files or directories within a served path can craft filenames containing malicious script or HTML content, leading to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) that executes in the context of users viewing the affected directory listing.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x","events":[{"introduced":"60a85baf9138c1cf7e816587d9f59a70ed55bcf3"},{"fixed":"81278bc4041d01225ace17944a0f4397ba6ba22f"}]}],"versions":["4.0.0","4.0.1","4.0.2","4.0.3","4.1.0","4.1.0.Beta1","4.1.0.CR1","4.1.0.CR2","4.1.1","4.2.0","4.2.0.Beta1","4.2.0.CR1","4.2.1","4.2.2","4.2.3","4.2.4","4.2.5","4.3.0","4.3.1","4.3.2","4.3.3","4.3.4","4.3.5","4.4.0","4.4.1","4.4.2","4.4.3","4.4.4","4.4.5","4.5.0","4.5.1","4.5.10","4.5.11","4.5.12","4.5.13","4.5.14","4.5.15","4.5.16","4.5.17","4.5.18","4.5.19","4.5.2","4.5.20","4.5.21","4.5.3","4.5.4","4.5.5","4.5.6","4.5.7","4.5.8","4.5.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-11966.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-web","events":[{"introduced":"7553ecb4e6bbe2888dd20e81675f662df26645b5"},{"fixed":"188938cb128d55e5897f51ad0b1be283f993a824"}]}],"versions":["4.0.0","4.0.1","4.0.2","4.0.3","4.1.0","4.1.0.Beta1","4.1.0.CR1","4.1.0.CR2","4.1.1","4.2.0","4.2.0.Beta1","4.2.0.CR1","4.2.1","4.2.2","4.2.3","4.2.4","4.2.5","4.3.0","4.3.1","4.3.2","4.3.3","4.3.4","4.3.5","4.4.0","4.4.1","4.4.2","4.4.3","4.4.4","4.4.5","4.5.0","4.5.1","4.5.10","4.5.11","4.5.12","4.5.13","4.5.14","4.5.15","4.5.16","4.5.17","4.5.18","4.5.19","4.5.2","4.5.20","4.5.21","4.5.3","4.5.4","4.5.5","4.5.6","4.5.7","4.5.8","4.5.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-11966.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/303"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
