  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/vt-d: Use device rbtree in iopf reporting path  The existing I/O page fault handler currently locates the PCI device by calling pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot(). This function searches the list of all PCI devices until the desired device is found. To improve lookup efficiency, replace it with device_rbtree_find() to search the device within the probed device rbtree.  The I/O page fault is initiated by the device, which does not have any synchronization mechanism with the software to ensure that the device stays in the probed device tree. Theoretically, a device could be released by the IOMMU subsystem after device_rbtree_find() and before iopf_get_dev_fault_param(), which would cause a use-after-free problem.  Add a mutex to synchronize the I/O page fault reporting path and the IOMMU release device path. This lock doesn't introduce any performance overhead, as the conflict between I/O page fault reporting and device releasing is very rare.",
