Instead of reaching `process.on('uncaughtException')`, the process terminates, making the crash unrecoverable. Applications that rely on `AsyncLocalStorage` (v22, v20) or `async_hooks.createHook()` (v24, v22, v20) become vulnerable to denial-of-service crashes triggered by deep recursion under specific conditions.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nodejs","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nodejs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"22.22.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["22.11.0-r0","22.11.0-r1","22.11.0-r2","22.13.1-r0","22.13.1-r1","22.13.1-r2","22.13.1-r3","22.13.1-r4","22.13.1-r5","22.16.0-r0","22.16.0-r1","22.16.0-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-59466.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nodejs","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.23","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/nodejs?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"24.13.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["22.11.0-r0","22.11.0-r1","22.11.0-r2","22.13.1-r0","22.13.1-r1","22.13.1-r2","22.13.1-r3","22.13.1-r4","22.13.1-r5","22.16.0-r0","22.16.0-r1","22.16.0-r2","22.16.0-r3","22.19.0-r3","22.19.0-r4","22.21.0-r0","24.11.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-59466.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2025-59466"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
