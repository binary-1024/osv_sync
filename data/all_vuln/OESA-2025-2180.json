It has been declared as problematic.The manipulation of the argument PATH with an unknown input leads to a unknown weakness.As an impact it is known to affect integrity.Upgrading to version 1.23.12 or 1.24.6 eliminates this vulnerability.(CVE-2025-47906)\n\nCancelling a query (e.g. by cancelling the context passed to one of the query methods) during a call to the Scan method of the returned Rows can result in unexpected results if other queries are being made in parallel. This can result in a race condition that may overwrite the expected results with those of another query, causing the call to Scan to return either unexpected results from the other query or an error.(CVE-2025-47907)",
