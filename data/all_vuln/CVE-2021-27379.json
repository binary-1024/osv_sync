This occurs because a backport missed a flush, and thus IOMMU updates were not always correct. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-15565.","references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/02/23/1"},{"type":"FIX","url":"http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-366.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4888"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-366.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
