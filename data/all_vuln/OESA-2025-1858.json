Prior to version 4.9.0, pycares is vulnerable to a use-after-free condition that occurs when a Channel object is garbage collected while DNS queries are still pending. This results in a fatal Python error and interpreter crash. The vulnerability has been fixed in pycares 4.9.0 by implementing a safe channel destruction mechanism.(CVE-2025-48945)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-pycares","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/python-pycares&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.9.0-1.oe2403sp2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python-pycares-debuginfo-4.9.0-1.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","python-pycares-debugsource-4.9.0-1.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","python-pycares-help-4.9.0-1.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","python3-pycares-4.9.0-1.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["python-pycares-4.9.0-1.oe2403sp2.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python-pycares-debuginfo-4.9.0-1.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","python-pycares-debugsource-4.9.0-1.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","python-pycares-help-4.9.0-1.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","python3-pycares-4.9.0-1.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-1858.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-1858"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48945"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
