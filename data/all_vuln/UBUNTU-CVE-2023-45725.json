These design document functions are:   *    list   *    show   *    rewrite   *    update An attacker can leak the session component using an HTML-like output, insert the session as an external resource (such as an image), or store the credential in a _local document with an \"update\" function. For the attack to succeed the attacker has to be able to insert the design documents into the database, then manipulate a user to access a function from that design document. Workaround: Avoid using design documents from untrusted sources which may attempt to access or manipulate request object's headers","affected":[{"package":{"name":"couchdb","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/couchdb@1.6.0-0ubuntu7?arch=source&distro=xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.6.0-0ubuntu7"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"couchdb","binary_version":"1.6.0-0ubuntu7"},{"binary_name":"couchdb-bin","binary_version":"1.6.0-0ubuntu7"},{"binary_name":"couchdb-common","binary_version":"1.6.0-0ubuntu7"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2023/UBUNTU-CVE-2023-45725.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2023-45725"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/pqjq9zt8vq9rsobkc1cow9sqm9vozlrg"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/cve/2023-45725.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45725"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
