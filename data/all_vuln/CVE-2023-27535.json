Previously created connections are kept in a connection pool for reuse if they match the current setup. However, certain FTP settings such as CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT, CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER, CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC, and CURLOPT_USE_SSL were not included in the configuration match checks, causing them to match too easily. This could lead to libcurl using the wrong credentials when performing a transfer, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.","references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/1892780"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00025.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/36NBD5YLJXXEDZLDGNFCERWRYJQ6LAQW/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-12"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230420-0010/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
