Sensitive secrets such as passwords, token and API keys should be compared only using a constant-time comparison function. Untrusted input, sourced from a HTTP header, is compared directly with a secret. Since this comparison is not secure, an attacker can mount a side-channel timing attack to guess the password. As a workaround, this can be easily fixed using a constant time comparing function such as `crypto/subtle`'s `ConstantTimeCompare`. \n","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-32691.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/32xxx/CVE-2023-32691.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ginuerzh/gost/blob/1c62376e0880e4094bd3731e06bd4f7842638f6a/auth.go#L46"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ginuerzh/gost/security/advisories/GHSA-qjrq-hm79-49ww"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32691"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-203"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/32xxx/CVE-2023-32691.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N"}]}
