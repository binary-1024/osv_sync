Prior to version 0.30.1, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in cpp-httplib due to the unsafe handling of compressed HTTP request bodies (Content-Encoding: gzip, br, etc.). The library validates the payload_max_length against the compressed data size received from the network, but does not limit the size of the decompressed data stored in memory.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"cpp-httplib","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/cpp-httplib?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.11.4+ds-1","0.11.4+ds-1+deb12u1","0.11.4+ds-2","0.11.4+ds-3","0.13.1+ds-1","0.14.0+ds-1","0.14.1+ds-1","0.14.1+ds-2","0.14.2+ds-1","0.14.3+ds-1","0.14.3+ds-1.1","0.14.3+ds-1.1~exp1","0.15.3+ds-1","0.15.3+ds-2","0.15.3+ds-3","0.16.0+ds-1","0.16.3+ds-1","0.16.3+ds-2","0.18.0+ds-1","0.18.7-1","0.20.1+ds-3","0.25.0+ds-1","0.26.0+ds-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22776.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cpp-httplib","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/cpp-httplib?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.18.7-1","0.20.1+ds-3","0.25.0+ds-1","0.26.0+ds-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22776.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cpp-httplib","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/cpp-httplib?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.18.7-1","0.20.1+ds-3","0.25.0+ds-1","0.26.0+ds-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22776.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2026-22776"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
