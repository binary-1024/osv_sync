  "details": "### Summary\n\nA use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability in Envoy's DNS cache causes abnormal process termination. Envoy may reallocate memory when processing a pending DNS resolution, causing list iterator to reference freed memory.\n\n### Details\n\nThe vulnerability exists in Envoy's Dynamic Forward Proxy implementation starting from version v1.34.0. The issue occurs when a completion callback for a DNS resolution triggers new DNS resolutions or removes existing pending resolutions. This condition may occur in the following configuration:\n\n1. Dynamic Forwarding Filter is enabled.\n2. `envoy.reloadable_features.dfp_cluster_resolves_hosts` runtime flag is enabled.\n3. The Host header is modified between the Dynamic Forwarding Filter and Router filters.\n\n### Impact\n\nDenial of service due to abnormal process termination.\n\n### Attack vector(s)\nRequest to Envoy configured as indicated above.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade to v1.35.1 or v1.34.5. \n\n### Workaround\nSet the `envoy.reloadable_features.dfp_cluster_resolves_hosts` runtime flag to `false`.\n\n### Detection\nAbnormal process termination with the `Envoy::Event::DispatcherImpl::runPostCallbacks()` frame in the call stack.\n\n### Credits\nRohit Agrawal ([agrawroh](https://github.com/agrawroh)) ([rohit.agrawal@databricks.com](mailto:rohit.agrawal@databricks.com))",
