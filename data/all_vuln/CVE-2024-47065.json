Prior to 2.5.1, traceroute responses from the remote node are not rate limited. Given that there are SNR measurements attributed to each received transmission, this is a guaranteed way to get a remote station to reliably and continuously respond. You could easily get 100 samples in a short amount of time (estimated 2 minutes), whereas passively doing the same could take hours or days. There are secondary effects that non-ratelimited traceroute does also allow a 2:1 reflected DoS of the network as well, but these concerns are less than the problem with positional confidentiality (other DoS routes exist). This vulnerability is fixed in 2.5.1.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-47065.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.5.1"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/security/advisories/GHSA-4hjx-54gf-2jh7"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
