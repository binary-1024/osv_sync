Starting in version 2.2.0 and prior to 2.5.0, urllib3 does not control redirects in browsers and Node.js. urllib3 supports being used in a Pyodide runtime utilizing the JavaScript Fetch API or falling back on XMLHttpRequest. This means Python libraries can be used to make HTTP requests from a browser or Node.js. Additionally, urllib3 provides a mechanism to control redirects, but the retries and redirect parameters are ignored with Pyodide; the runtime itself determines redirect behavior. This issue has been patched in version 2.5.0.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-urllib3","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-urllib3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.26.12-1","1.26.16-1","1.26.17-1","1.26.18-1","1.26.18-2","1.26.5-1~exp1","1.26.5-1~exp1+deb11u1","1.26.8-1","1.26.9-1","2.0.7-1","2.0.7-2","2.2.3-1","2.2.3-2","2.2.3-3","2.2.3-4","2.3.0-1","2.3.0-2","2.3.0-3","2.5.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-50182.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-urllib3","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-urllib3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.26.12-1","1.26.12-1+deb12u1","1.26.16-1","1.26.17-1","1.26.18-1","1.26.18-2","2.0.7-1","2.0.7-2","2.2.3-1","2.2.3-2","2.2.3-3","2.2.3-4","2.3.0-1","2.3.0-2","2.3.0-3","2.5.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-50182.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-urllib3","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-urllib3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.3.0-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-50182.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-urllib3","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-urllib3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.3.0-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-50182.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-50182"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
