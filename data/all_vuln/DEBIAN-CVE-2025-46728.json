{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-46728","published":"2025-05-06T01:15:50Z","modified":"2025-10-14T04:26:55.058512Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-46728"],"details":"cpp-httplib is a C++ header-only HTTP/HTTPS server and client library. Prior to version 0.20.1, the library fails to enforce configured size limits on incoming request bodies when `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is used or when no `Content-Length` header is provided. A remote attacker can send a chunked request without the terminating zero-length chunk, causing uncontrolled memory allocation on the server. This leads to potential exhaustion of system memory and results in a server crash or unresponsiveness. Version 0.20.1 fixes the issue by enforcing limits during parsing. If the limit is exceeded at any point during reading, the connection is terminated immediately. A short-term workaround through a Reverse Proxy is available. If updating the library immediately is not feasible, deploy a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) in front of the `cpp-httplib` application. Configure the proxy to enforce maximum request body size limits, thereby stopping excessively large requests before they reach the vulnerable library code.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"cpp-httplib","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/cpp-httplib?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.11.4+ds-1","0.11.4+ds-1+deb12u1","0.11.4+ds-2","0.11.4+ds-3","0.13.1+ds-1","0.14.0+ds-1","0.14.1+ds-1","0.14.1+ds-2","0.14.2+ds-1","0.14.3+ds-1","0.14.3+ds-1.1","0.14.3+ds-1.1~exp1","0.15.3+ds-1","0.15.3+ds-2","0.15.3+ds-3","0.16.0+ds-1","0.16.3+ds-1","0.16.3+ds-2","0.18.0+ds-1","0.18.7-1","0.20.1+ds-3","0.25.0+ds-1","0.26.0+ds-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-46728.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cpp-httplib","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/cpp-httplib?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.18.7-1","0.20.1+ds-3","0.25.0+ds-1","0.26.0+ds-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-46728.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cpp-httplib","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/cpp-httplib?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.18.7-1","0.20.1+ds-3","0.25.0+ds-1","0.26.0+ds-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-46728.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-46728"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
