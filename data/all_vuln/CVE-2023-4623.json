This leaves a dangling pointer that can cause a use-after-free.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit b3d26c5702c7d6c45456326e56d2ccf3f103e60f.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/175963/Kernel-Live-Patch-Security-Notice-LSN-0099-1.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=b3d26c5702c7d6c45456326e56d2ccf3f103e60f"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://kernel.dance/b3d26c5702c7d6c45456326e56d2ccf3f103e60f"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00027.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/01/msg00004.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
