The input parameter passed in register x1 is not validated well enough in the function sdei_interrupt_bind. The parameter is passed to a call to plat_ic_get_interrupt_type. It can be any arbitrary value passing checks in the function plat_ic_is_sgi. A compromised Normal World (Linux kernel) can enable a root-privileged attacker to issue arbitrary SMC calls. Using this primitive, he can control the content of registers x0 through x6, which are used to send parameters to TF-A. Out-of-bounds addresses can be read in the context of TF-A (EL3). Because the read value is never returned to non-secure memory or in registers, no leak is possible. An attacker can still crash TF-A, however.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"arm-trusted-firmware","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/arm-trusted-firmware?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.10.0+dfsg-1","2.10.10+dfsg-1","2.12.0+dfsg-1","2.12.0+dfsg-2","2.12.1+dfsg-1","2.4+dfsg-2","2.5+dfsg-1","2.5+dfsg-2","2.6+dfsg-1","2.6~rc0+dfsg-1","2.7.0+dfsg-1","2.7.0+dfsg-2","2.8.0+dfsg-1","2.9.0+dfsg-1","2.9.0+dfsg-2","2.9.0+dfsg-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-49100.json"}},{"package":{"name":"arm-trusted-firmware","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/arm-trusted-firmware?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.10.0+dfsg-1","2.10.10+dfsg-1","2.12.0+dfsg-1","2.12.0+dfsg-2","2.12.1+dfsg-1","2.8.0+dfsg-1","2.9.0+dfsg-1","2.9.0+dfsg-2","2.9.0+dfsg-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-49100.json"}},{"package":{"name":"arm-trusted-firmware","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/arm-trusted-firmware?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.10.0+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-49100.json"}},{"package":{"name":"arm-trusted-firmware","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/arm-trusted-firmware?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.10.0+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-49100.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-49100"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
