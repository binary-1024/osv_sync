  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ibmvnic: Do not reset dql stats on NON_FATAL err  All ibmvnic resets, make a call to netdev_tx_reset_queue() when re-opening the device. netdev_tx_reset_queue() resets the num_queued and num_completed byte counters. These stats are used in Byte Queue Limit (BQL) algorithms. The difference between these two stats tracks the number of bytes currently sitting on the physical NIC. ibmvnic increases the number of queued bytes though calls to netdev_tx_sent_queue() in the drivers xmit function. When, VIOS reports that it is done transmitting bytes, the ibmvnic device increases the number of completed bytes through calls to netdev_tx_completed_queue(). It is important to note that the driver batches its transmit calls and num_queued is increased every time that an skb is added to the next batch, not necessarily when the batch is sent to VIOS for transmission.  Unlike other reset types, a NON FATAL reset will not flush the sub crq tx buffers. Therefore, it is possible for the batched skb array to be partially full. So if there is call to netdev_tx_reset_queue() when re-opening the device, the value of num_queued (0) would not account for the skb's that are currently batched. Eventually, when the batch is sent to VIOS, the call to netdev_tx_completed_queue() would increase num_completed to a value greater than the num_queued. This causes a BUG_ON crash:  ibmvnic 30000002: Firmware reports error, cause: adapter problem.
