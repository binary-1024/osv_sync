  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ceph: blocklist the kclient when receiving corrupted snap trace  When received corrupted snap trace we don't know what exactly has happened in MDS side. And we shouldn't continue IOs and metadatas access to MDS, which may corrupt or get incorrect contents.  This patch will just block all the further IO/MDS requests immediately and then evict the kclient itself.  The reason why we still need to evict the kclient just after blocking all the further IOs is that the MDS could revoke the caps faster.",
