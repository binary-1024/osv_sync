In versions prior to 3.4.5, ldap.dn.escape_dn_chars() escapes \\x00 incorrectly by emitting a backslash followed by a literal NUL byte instead of the RFC-4514 hex form \\00. Any application that uses this helper to construct DNs from untrusted input can be made to consistently fail before a request is sent to the LDAP server (e.g., AD), resulting in a client-side denial of service. Version 3.4.5 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-ldap","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-ldap?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.2.0-4","3.3.1-1","3.4.0-1","3.4.0-1~exp1","3.4.0-2","3.4.2-1","3.4.2-2","3.4.2-3","3.4.3-1","3.4.3-2","3.4.4-1","3.4.4-2","3.4.5-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-61912.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-ldap","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-ldap?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.4.3-2","3.4.4-1","3.4.4-2","3.4.5-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-61912.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-ldap","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-ldap?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.4.4-1","3.4.4-2","3.4.5-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-61912.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-ldap","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-ldap?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.4.5-1"}]}],"versions":["3.4.4-1","3.4.4-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-61912.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-61912"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
