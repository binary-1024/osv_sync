  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/stacktrace: Use break instead of return statement  arch_stack_walk_user_common() contains a return statement instead of a break statement in case store_ip() fails while trying to store a callchain entry of a user space process. This may lead to a missing pagefault_enable() call.  If this happens any subsequent page fault of the process won't be resolved by the page fault handler and this in turn will lead to the process being killed.  Use a break instead of a return statement to fix this.",
