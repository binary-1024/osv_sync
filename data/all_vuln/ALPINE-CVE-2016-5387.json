NOTE: the vendor states \"This mitigation has been assigned the identifier CVE-2016-5387\"; in other words, this is not a CVE ID for a vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"apache2","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.4","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/apache2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.23-r1"}]}],"versions":["2.2.16-r0","2.2.16-r1","2.2.16-r2","2.2.16-r3","2.2.17-r0","2.2.17-r1","2.2.17-r2","2.2.17-r3","2.2.17-r4","2.2.17-r5","2.2.20-r0","2.2.21-r0","2.2.21-r1","2.2.21-r2","2.2.21-r3","2.2.22-r0","2.2.22-r1","2.4.10-r0","2.4.12-r0","2.4.12-r1","2.4.12-r2","2.4.12-r3","2.4.12-r4","2.4.16-r0","2.4.17-r0","2.4.17-r1","2.4.17-r2","2.4.17-r3","2.4.17-r4","2.4.17-r5","2.4.17-r6","2.4.17-r7","2.4.18-r0","2.4.18-r1","2.4.18-r2","2.4.20-r0","2.4.20-r1","2.4.20-r2","2.4.23-r0","2.4.3-r0","2.4.3-r1","2.4.3-r2","2.4.4-r0","2.4.4-r1","2.4.6-r0","2.4.6-r1","2.4.6-r2","2.4.6-r3","2.4.6-r4","2.4.7-r0","2.4.9-r0","2.4.9-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2016-5387.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2016-5387"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
