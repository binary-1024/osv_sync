  "details": "The bdf parser reads a count for the number of properties defined in\na font from the font file, and allocates arrays with entries for each\nproperty based on that count.  It never checked to see if that count\nwas negative, or large enough to overflow when multiplied by the size\nof the structures being allocated, and could thus allocate the wrong\nbuffer size, leading to out of bounds writes (CVE-2015-1802).\n\nIf the bdf parser failed to parse the data for the bitmap for any\ncharacter, it would proceed with an invalid pointer to the bitmap\ndata and later crash when trying to read the bitmap from that pointer\n(CVE-2015-1803).\n\nThe bdf parser read metrics values as 32-bit integers, but stored\nthem into 16-bit integers.  Overflows could occur in various operations\nleading to out-of-bounds memory access (CVE-2015-1804).\n",
