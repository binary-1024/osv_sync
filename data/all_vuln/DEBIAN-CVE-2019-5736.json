This occurs because of file-descriptor mishandling, related to /proc/self/exe.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"lxc","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/lxc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:3.1.0+really3.0.3-4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-5736.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lxc","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/lxc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:3.1.0+really3.0.3-4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-5736.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lxc","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/lxc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:3.1.0+really3.0.3-4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-5736.json"}},{"package":{"name":"lxc","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/lxc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:3.1.0+really3.0.3-4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-5736.json"}},{"package":{"name":"runc","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/runc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.0~rc6+dfsg1-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-5736.json"}},{"package":{"name":"runc","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/runc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.0~rc6+dfsg1-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-5736.json"}},{"package":{"name":"runc","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/runc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.0~rc6+dfsg1-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-5736.json"}},{"package":{"name":"runc","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/runc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.0~rc6+dfsg1-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2019-5736.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-5736"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
