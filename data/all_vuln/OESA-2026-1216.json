Assimp aims to provide a full asset conversion pipeline for use in game engines and real-time rendering systems of any kind, but is not limited to this purpose.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function MDCImporter::InternReadFile of the file assimp/code/AssetLib/MDC/MDCLoader.cpp of the component MDC File Parser. The manipulation of the argument pcVerts leads to out-of-bounds read. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The project decided to collect all Fuzzer bugs in a main-issue to address them in the future.(CVE-2025-5166)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"assimp","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/assimp&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.3.1-12.oe2403sp2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["assimp-5.3.1-12.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","assimp-debuginfo-5.3.1-12.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","assimp-debugsource-5.3.1-12.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","assimp-devel-5.3.1-12.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["assimp-help-5.3.1-12.oe2403sp2.noarch.rpm","python3-assimp-5.3.1-12.oe2403sp2.noarch.rpm"],"src":["assimp-5.3.1-12.oe2403sp2.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["assimp-5.3.1-12.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","assimp-debuginfo-5.3.1-12.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","assimp-debugsource-5.3.1-12.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","assimp-devel-5.3.1-12.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2026-1216.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2026-1216"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-5166"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
