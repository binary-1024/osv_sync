This flaw can be triggered when a libsoup client receives a 401 (Unauthorized) HTTP response containing a specifically crafted domain parameter within the WWW-Authenticate header. Processing this malformed header can lead to a crash of the client application using libsoup. An attacker could exploit this by setting up a malicious HTTP server. If a user's application using the vulnerable libsoup library connects to this malicious server, it could result in a denial-of-service. Successful exploitation requires tricking a user's client application into connecting to the attacker's malicious server.","references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2366513"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-4476"}]}
