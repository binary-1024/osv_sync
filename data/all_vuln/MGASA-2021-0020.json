  "details": "While investigating Apache issue 64830 it was discovered that Apache Tomcat\ncould re-use an HTTP request header value from the previous stream received on\nan HTTP/2 connection for the request associated with the subsequent stream.\nWhile this would most likely lead to an error and the closure of the HTTP/2\nconnection, it is possible that information could leak between requests\n(CVE-2020-17527).\n\nThe tomcat package has been updated to version 9.0.39, and patched to fix\nthis issue.\n",
