  "details": "In all versions of libyang before 1.0-r5, a stack-based buffer overflow was discovered in the way libyang parses YANG files with a leaf of type \"identityref\". An application that uses libyang to parse untrusted YANG files may be vulnerable to this flaw, which would allow an attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly gain code execution.",
