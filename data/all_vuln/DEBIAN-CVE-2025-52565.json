{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-52565","published":"2025-11-06T20:15:49Z","modified":"2025-11-07T11:19:55.237585Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-52565"],"details":"runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. Versions 1.0.0-rc3 through 1.2.7, 1.3.0-rc.1 through 1.3.2, and 1.4.0-rc.1 through 1.4.0-rc.2, due to insufficient checks when bind-mounting `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` inside the container, an attacker can trick runc into bind-mounting paths which would normally be made read-only or be masked onto a path that the attacker can write to. This attack is very similar in concept and application to CVE-2025-31133, except that it attacks a similar vulnerability in a different target (namely, the bind-mount of `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` as configured for all containers that allocate a console). This happens after `pivot_root(2)`, so this cannot be used to write to host files directly -- however, as with CVE-2025-31133, this can load to denial of service of the host or a container breakout by providing the attacker with a writable copy of `/proc/sysrq-trigger` or `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` (respectively). This issue is fixed in versions 1.2.8, 1.3.3 and 1.4.0-rc.3.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"runc","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/runc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0+ds1-1","1.0.0~rc93+ds1-5","1.0.0~rc93+ds1-5+deb11u1","1.0.0~rc93+ds1-5+deb11u2","1.0.0~rc93+ds1-5+deb11u3","1.0.0~rc93+ds1-5+deb11u4","1.0.0~rc93+ds1-5+deb11u5","1.0.0~rc93.144.g6538f9f2+ds1-1","1.0.0~rc94+ds1-1","1.0.0~rc94+ds1-2","1.0.0~rc95.86.g2f8e8e9d+ds1-1","1.0.1+ds1-1","1.0.1+ds1-2","1.0.2+ds1-1","1.0.2+ds1-2","1.0.3+ds1-1","1.1.0+ds1-1","1.1.0~rc.1+ds1-1","1.1.1+ds1-1","1.1.10+ds1-1","1.1.12+ds1-1","1.1.12+ds1-2","1.1.12+ds1-3","1.1.12+ds1-4","1.1.12+ds1-5","1.1.12+ds1-5.1","1.1.15+ds1-1","1.1.15+ds1-2","1.1.3+ds1-1","1.1.3+ds1-2","1.1.3+ds1-3","1.1.3+ds1-4","1.1.3+ds1-5","1.1.3+ds1-6","1.1.3+ds1-7","1.1.4+ds1-1","1.1.5+ds1-1","1.1.5+ds1-2","1.1.5+ds1-3","1.1.5+ds1-4","1.1.5+ds1-5","1.3.0+ds1-1","1.3.0+ds1-2","1.3.0+ds1-3","1.3.0+ds1-4","1.3.2+ds1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-52565.json"}},{"package":{"name":"runc","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/runc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.1.10+ds1-1","1.1.12+ds1-1","1.1.12+ds1-2","1.1.12+ds1-3","1.1.12+ds1-4","1.1.12+ds1-5","1.1.12+ds1-5.1","1.1.15+ds1-1","1.1.15+ds1-2","1.1.5+ds1-1","1.1.5+ds1-1+deb12u1","1.1.5+ds1-2","1.1.5+ds1-3","1.1.5+ds1-4","1.1.5+ds1-5","1.3.0+ds1-1","1.3.0+ds1-2","1.3.0+ds1-3","1.3.0+ds1-4","1.3.2+ds1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-52565.json"}},{"package":{"name":"runc","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/runc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.1.15+ds1-2","1.3.0+ds1-1","1.3.0+ds1-2","1.3.0+ds1-3","1.3.0+ds1-4","1.3.2+ds1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-52565.json"}},{"package":{"name":"runc","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/runc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.1.15+ds1-2","1.3.0+ds1-1","1.3.0+ds1-2","1.3.0+ds1-3","1.3.0+ds1-4","1.3.2+ds1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-52565.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-52565"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
