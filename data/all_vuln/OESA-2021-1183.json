  "details": "Exiv2 is a Cross-platform C++ library and a command line utility to manage image metadata. It provides fast and easy read and write access to the Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata and the ICC Profile embedded within digital images in various formats.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in Exiv2 in versions before and including 0.27.4-RC1. Improper input validation of the rawData.size property in Jp2Image::readMetadata() in jp2image.cpp can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted JPG image containing malicious EXIF data.(CVE-2021-3482)\r\n\r\nExiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. A heap buffer overflow was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. The heap overflow is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when _writing_ the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than _reading_ the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `insert`. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4.(CVE-2021-29457)\r\n\r\nExiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file.
