  "details": "expat is a stream-oriented XML parser library written in C. expat excels with files too large to fit RAM, and where performance and flexibility are crucial.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nexpat 2.1.0 and earlier does not properly handle entities expansion unless an application developer uses the XML_SetEntityDeclHandler function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption), send HTTP requests to intranet servers, or read arbitrary files via a crafted XML document, aka an XML External Entity (XXE) issue.  NOTE: it could be argued that because expat already provides the ability to disable external entity expansion, the responsibility for resolving this issue lies with application developers; according to this argument, this entry should be REJECTed, and each affected application would need its own CVE.(CVE-2013-0340)",
