It will re-allocate the pointer it is passed on first call, when the data is ascii85 encoded, using kvmalloc/ kvfree().  Which means the data *passed* to it must be kvmalloc'd, ie. we cannot use the state_kcalloc() helper.  This partially reverts commit ec8f1813bf8d (\"drm/msm/a6xx: Replace kcalloc() with kvzalloc()\"), but adds the missing kvfree() to fix the memory leak that was present previously.  And adds a warning comment.
