But the code then accesses the udev\nfield of the freed object to put the USB device. This may also lead to a\nmemory leak of the usb device. Fix this by using udev from interface.(CVE-2025-37796)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncodel: remove sch-&gt;q.qlen check before qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog()\n\nAfter making all -&gt;qlen_notify() callbacks idempotent, now it is safe to\nremove the check of qlen!=0 from both fq_codel_dequeue() and\ncodel_qdisc_dequeue().(CVE-2025-37798)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet_sched: qfq: Fix double list add in class with netem as child qdisc\n\nAs described in Gerrard&apos;s report [1], there are use cases where a netem\nchild qdisc will make the parent qdisc&apos;s enqueue callback reentrant.\nIn the case of qfq, there won&apos;t be a UAF, but the code will add the same\nclassifier to the list twice, which will cause memory corruption.\n\nThis patch checks whether the class was already added to the agg-&gt;active\nlist (cl_is_active) before doing the addition to cater for the reentrant\ncase.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/CAHcdcOm+03OD2j6R0=YHKqmy=VgJ8xEOKuP6c7mSgnp-TEJJbw@mail.gmail.com/(CVE-2025-37913)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet_sched: drr: Fix double list add in class with netem as child qdisc\n\nAs described in Gerrard&apos;s report [1], there are use cases where a netem\nchild qdisc will make the parent qdisc&apos;s enqueue callback reentrant.\nIn the case of drr, there won&apos;t be a UAF, but the code will add the same\nclassifier to the list twice, which will cause memory corruption.\n\nIn addition to checking for qlen being zero, this patch checks whether the\nclass was already added to the active_list (cl_is_active) before adding\nto the list to cover for the reentrant case.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/CAHcdcOm+03OD2j6R0=YHKqmy=VgJ8xEOKuP6c7mSgnp-TEJJbw@mail.gmail.com/(CVE-2025-37915)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/iwcm: Fix use-after-free of work objects after cm_id destruction\n\nThe commit 59c68ac31e15 (&quot;iw_cm: free cm_id resources on the last\nderef&quot;) simplified cm_id resource management by freeing cm_id once all\nreferences to the cm_id were removed. The references are removed either\nupon completion of iw_cm event handlers or when the application destroys\nthe cm_id. This commit introduced the use-after-free condition where\ncm_id_private object could still be in use by event handler works during\nthe destruction of cm_id. The commit aee2424246f9 (&quot;RDMA/iwcm: Fix a\nuse-after-free related to destroying CM IDs&quot;) addressed this use-after-\nfree by flushing all pending works at the cm_id destruction.\n\nHowever, still another use-after-free possibility remained. It happens\nwith the work objects allocated for each cm_id_priv within\nalloc_work_entries() during cm_id creation, and subsequently freed in\ndealloc_work_entries() once all references to the cm_id are removed.\nIf the cm_id&apos;s last reference is decremented in the event handler work,\nthe work object for the work itself gets removed, and causes the use-\nafter-free BUG below:\n\n  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in __pwq_activate_work+0x1ff/0x250\n  Read of size 8 at addr ffff88811f9cf800 by task kworker/u16:1/147091\n\n  CPU: 2 UID: 0 PID: 147091 Comm: kworker/u16:1 Not tainted 6.15.0-rc2+ #27 PREEMPT(voluntary)\n  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.16.3-3.fc41 04/01/2014\n  Workqueue:  0x0 (iw_cm_wq)\n  Call Trace:\n   &lt;TASK&gt;\n   dump_stack_lvl+0x6a/0x90\n   print_report+0x174/0x554\n   ? __virt_addr_valid+0x208/0x430\n   ? __pwq_activate_work+0x1ff/0x250\n   kasan_report+0xae/0x170\n   ? __pwq_activate_work+0x1ff/0x250\n   __pwq_activate_work+0x1ff/0x250\n   pwq_dec_nr_in_flight+0x8c5/0xfb0\n   process_one_work+0xc11/0x1460\n   ? __pfx_process_one_work+0x10/0x10\n   ? assign_work+0x16c/0x240\n   worker_thread+0x5ef/0xfd0\n   ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10\n   kthread+0x3b0/0x770\n   ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n   ? rcu_is_watching+0x11/0xb0\n   ? _raw_spin_unlock_irq+0x24/0x50\n   ? rcu_is_watching+0x11/0xb0\n   ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n   ret_from_fork+0x30/0x70\n   ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n   &lt;/TASK&gt;\n\n  Allocated by task 147416:\n   kasan_save_stack+0x2c/0x50\n   kasan_save_track+0x10/0x30\n   __kasan_kmalloc+0xa6/0xb0\n   alloc_work_entries+0xa9/0x260 [iw_cm]\n   iw_cm_connect+0x23/0x4a0 [iw_cm]\n   rdma_connect_locked+0xbfd/0x1920 [rdma_cm]\n   nvme_rdma_cm_handler+0x8e5/0x1b60 [nvme_rdma]\n   cma_cm_event_handler+0xae/0x320 [rdma_cm]\n   cma_work_handler+0x106/0x1b0 [rdma_cm]\n   process_one_work+0x84f/0x1460\n   worker_thread+0x5ef/0xfd0\n   kthread+0x3b0/0x770\n   ret_from_fork+0x30/0x70\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n\n  Freed by task 147091:\n   kasan_save_stack+0x2c/0x50\n   kasan_save_track+0x10/0x30\n   kasan_save_free_info+0x37/0x60\n   __kasan_slab_free+0x4b/0x70\n   kfree+0x13a/0x4b0\n   dealloc_work_entries+0x125/0x1f0 [iw_cm]\n   iwcm_deref_id+0x6f/0xa0 [iw_cm]\n   cm_work_handler+0x136/0x1ba0 [iw_cm]\n   process_one_work+0x84f/0x1460\n   worker_thread+0x5ef/0xfd0\n   kthread+0x3b0/0x770\n   ret_from_fork+0x30/0x70\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n\n  Last potentially related work creation:\n   kasan_save_stack+0x2c/0x50\n   kasan_record_aux_stack+0xa3/0xb0\n   __queue_work+0x2ff/0x1390\n   queue_work_on+0x67/0xc0\n   cm_event_handler+0x46a/0x820 [iw_cm]\n   siw_cm_upcall+0x330/0x650 [siw]\n   siw_cm_work_handler+0x6b9/0x2b20 [siw]\n   process_one_work+0x84f/0x1460\n   worker_thread+0x5ef/0xfd0\n   kthread+0x3b0/0x770\n   ret_from_fork+0x30/0x70\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n\nThis BUG is reproducible by repeating the blktests test case nvme/061\nfor the rdma transport and the siw driver.\n\nTo avoid the use-after-free of cm_id_private work objects, ensure that\nthe last reference to the cm_id is decremented not in the event handler\nworks, but in the cm_id destruction context.
