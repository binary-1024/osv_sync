{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2025-47917","published":"2025-07-20T19:15:23Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:30:08.510672Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-47917"],"details":"Mbed TLS before 3.6.4 allows a use-after-free in certain situations of applications that are developed in accordance with the documentation. The function mbedtls_x509_string_to_names() takes a head argument that is documented as an output argument. The documentation does not suggest that the function will free that pointer; however, the function does call mbedtls_asn1_free_named_data_list() on that argument, which performs a deep free(). As a result, application code that uses this function (relying only on documented behavior) is likely to still hold pointers to the memory blocks that were freed, resulting in a high risk of use-after-free or double-free. In particular, the two sample programs x509/cert_write and x509/cert_req are affected (use-after-free if the san string contains more than one DN).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.10-r0","2.16.10-r1","2.16.12-r0","2.16.12-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.16.6-r0","2.16.8-r0","2.16.9-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.1-r0","2.28.1-r1","2.28.2-r0","2.28.3-r0","2.28.3-r1","2.28.3-r2","2.28.3-r3","2.28.4-r0","2.28.5-r0","2.28.6-r0","2.28.7-r0","2.28.8-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.2-r0","3.6.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-47917.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.10-r0","2.16.10-r1","2.16.12-r0","2.16.12-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.16.6-r0","2.16.8-r0","2.16.9-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.1-r0","2.28.1-r1","2.28.2-r0","2.28.3-r0","2.28.3-r1","2.28.3-r2","2.28.3-r3","2.28.4-r0","2.28.5-r0","2.28.6-r0","2.28.7-r0","2.28.8-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.2-r0","3.6.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-47917.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.10-r0","2.16.10-r1","2.16.12-r0","2.16.12-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.16.6-r0","2.16.8-r0","2.16.9-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.1-r0","2.28.1-r1","2.28.2-r0","2.28.3-r0","2.28.3-r1","2.28.3-r2","2.28.3-r3","2.28.4-r0","2.28.5-r0","2.28.6-r0","2.28.7-r0","2.28.8-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.2-r0","3.6.3-r0","3.6.3.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-47917.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2025-47917"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
