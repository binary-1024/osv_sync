This leads to valid signatures being rejected. Legitimate transactions or communications may be incorrectly flagged as invalid.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"node-elliptic","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-elliptic?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.5.4~dfsg-1","6.5.4~dfsg-2","6.5.7+dfsg-1","6.6.1+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-48948.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-elliptic","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-elliptic?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.5.4~dfsg-2","6.5.7+dfsg-1","6.6.1+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-48948.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-elliptic","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-elliptic?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.6.1+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-48948.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-elliptic","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-elliptic?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.6.1+dfsg-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-48948.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-48948"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L"}]}
