  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/panfrost: Job should reference MMU not file_priv  For a while now it's been allowed for a MMU context to outlive it's corresponding panfrost_priv, however the job structure still references panfrost_priv to get hold of the MMU context. If panfrost_priv has been freed this is a use-after-free which I've been able to trigger resulting in a splat.  To fix this, drop the reference to panfrost_priv in the job structure and add a direct reference to the MMU structure which is what's actually needed.",
