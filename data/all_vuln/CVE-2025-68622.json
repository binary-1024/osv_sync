{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68622","published":"2026-01-12T17:08:22.941Z","modified":"2026-01-15T05:52:36.475407Z","aliases":["GHSA-g65h-9ggq-9827"],"summary":"Espressif ESP-IDF USB Host UVC Class Driver has a stack buffer overflow in UVC descriptor printing","details":"Espressif ESP-IDF USB Host UVC Class Driver allows video streaming from USB cameras. Prior to 2.4.0, a vulnerability in the esp-usb UVC host implementation allows a malicious USB Video Class (UVC) device to trigger a stack buffer overflow during configuration-descriptor parsing. When UVC configuration-descriptor printing is enabled, the host prints detailed descriptor information provided by the connected USB device. A specially crafted UVC descriptor may advertise an excessively large length. Because this value is not validated before being copied into a fixed-size stack buffer, an attacker can overflow the buffer and corrupt memory. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.4.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/espressif/esp-usb","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"77a38b15a17f6e3c7aeb620eb4aeaf61d5194cc0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68622.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/usb_host_uvc/versions/2.4.0/changelog"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68622.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/espressif/esp-usb/commit/77a38b15a17f6e3c7aeb620eb4aeaf61d5194cc0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/espressif/esp-usb/security/advisories/GHSA-g65h-9ggq-9827"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68622"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-121"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68622.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
