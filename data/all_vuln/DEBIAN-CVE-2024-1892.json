By crafting malicious XML content that exploits inefficient regular expression complexity used in the parsing process, an attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability allows for the system to hang and consume significant resources, potentially rendering services that utilize Scrapy for XML processing unresponsive.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-scrapy","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-scrapy?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.10.0-1","2.11.0-1","2.11.0-2","2.11.1-1","2.11.1-2","2.11.2-1","2.11.2-2","2.11.2-3","2.12.0-1","2.12.0-2","2.13.1-1~exp1","2.13.3-1","2.13.3-1~exp1","2.4.1-2","2.4.1-2+deb11u1","2.5.0-1","2.5.0-1~exp1","2.5.0-2","2.5.1-1","2.5.1-2","2.6.1-1","2.6.2-1","2.7.0-1","2.7.1-1","2.8.0-1","2.8.0-2","2.9.0-1","2.9.0-1~exp1","2.9.0-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-1892.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-scrapy","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-scrapy?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.10.0-1","2.11.0-1","2.11.0-2","2.11.1-1","2.11.1-2","2.11.2-1","2.11.2-2","2.11.2-3","2.12.0-1","2.12.0-2","2.13.1-1~exp1","2.13.3-1","2.13.3-1~exp1","2.8.0-2","2.9.0-1","2.9.0-1~exp1","2.9.0-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-1892.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-scrapy","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-scrapy?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.11.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-1892.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-scrapy","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-scrapy?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.11.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-1892.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-1892"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
