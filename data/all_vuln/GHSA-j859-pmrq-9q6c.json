  "details": "A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA decryption implementation which could enable a recovery of plaintext from across the network.  This affects all RSA padding modes. A server agent compiled with OpenSSL could be made to give up plaintext payloads over the network, but this would require a large amount of malicious payloads from a third party actor as trial messages. OpenSSL removed in bottlerocket version 1.1.0 in favor of Rust-based TLS using rustls.",
