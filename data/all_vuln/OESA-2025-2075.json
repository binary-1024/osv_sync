  "details": "OpenJPEG is an open-source JPEG 2000 codec written in C language. It has been developed in order to promote the use of JPEG 2000, a still-image compression standard from the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG). Since April 2015, it is officially recognized by ISO/IEC and ITU-T as a JPEG 2000 Reference Software.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in OpenJPEG 2.5.0 (Image Processing Software).Using CWE to declare the problem leads to CWE-476. A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, typically causing a crash or exit.Impacted is availability.There is no information about possible countermeasures known. It may be suggested to replace the affected object with an alternative product.(CVE-2025-50952)",
