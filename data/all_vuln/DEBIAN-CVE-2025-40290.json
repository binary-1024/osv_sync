{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-40290","published":"2025-12-08T01:16:00.890Z","modified":"2025-12-14T04:04:19.914006Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-40290"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xsk: avoid data corruption on cq descriptor number  Since commit 30f241fcf52a (\"xsk: Fix immature cq descriptor production\"), the descriptor number is stored in skb control block and xsk_cq_submit_addr_locked() relies on it to put the umem addrs onto pool's completion queue.  skb control block shouldn't be used for this purpose as after transmit xsk doesn't have control over it and other subsystems could use it. This leads to the following kernel panic due to a NULL pointer dereference.
