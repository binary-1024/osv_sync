It handles all requests in a single, non-blocking, I/O-driven process and keeps meta data and implements negative caching of failed requests.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When Squid is parsing ESI, it keeps the ESI elements in ESIContext. ESIContext contains a buffer for holding a stack of ESIElements. When a new ESIElement is parsed, it is added via addStackElement. addStackElement has a check for the number of elements in this buffer, but it s off by 1, leading to a Heap Overflow of 1 element. The overflow is within the same structure so it can t affect adjacent memory blocks, and thus just leads to a crash while processing.(CVE-2019-12521)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"squid","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/squid&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.9-11.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["squid-4.9-11.oe1.aarch64.rpm","squid-debuginfo-4.9-11.oe1.aarch64.rpm","squid-debugsource-4.9-11.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["squid-4.9-11.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["squid-debuginfo-4.9-11.oe1.x86_64.rpm","squid-debugsource-4.9-11.oe1.x86_64.rpm","squid-4.9-11.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1851.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2022-1851"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12521"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
