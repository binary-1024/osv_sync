  "details": "Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server. It handles all requests in a single, non-blocking, I/O-driven process and keeps meta data and implements negative caching of failed requests.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When Squid is parsing ESI, it keeps the ESI elements in ESIContext. ESIContext contains a buffer for holding a stack of ESIElements. When a new ESIElement is parsed, it is added via addStackElement. addStackElement has a check for the number of elements in this buffer, but it s off by 1, leading to a Heap Overflow of 1 element. The overflow is within the same structure so it can t affect adjacent memory blocks, and thus just leads to a crash while processing.(CVE-2019-12521)",
