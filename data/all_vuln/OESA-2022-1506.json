Often contrary to the user&apos;s expectations and intentions and without telling the user it happened.(CVE-2021-22923)\r\n\r\nWhen curl is instructed to download content using the metalink feature, thecontents is verified against a hash provided in the metalink XML file.The metalink XML file points out to the client how to get the same contentfrom a set of different URLs, potentially hosted by different servers and theclient can then download the file from one or several of them. In a serial orparallel manner.If one of the servers hosting the contents has been breached and the contentsof the specific file on that server is replaced with a modified payload, curlshould detect this when the hash of the file mismatches after a completeddownload. It should remove the contents and instead try getting the contentsfrom another URL. This is not done, and instead such a hash mismatch is onlymentioned in text and the potentially malicious content is kept in the file ondisk.(CVE-2021-22922)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/curl&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.71.1-12.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["curl-7.71.1-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","curl-debuginfo-7.71.1-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libcurl-devel-7.71.1-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","curl-debugsource-7.71.1-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libcurl-7.71.1-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["curl-help-7.71.1-12.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["curl-7.71.1-12.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libcurl-7.71.1-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","curl-debuginfo-7.71.1-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","curl-debugsource-7.71.1-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libcurl-devel-7.71.1-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","curl-7.71.1-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1506.json"}},{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/curl&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.71.1-12.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["curl-debuginfo-7.71.1-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","curl-7.71.1-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libcurl-7.71.1-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libcurl-devel-7.71.1-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","curl-debugsource-7.71.1-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["curl-help-7.71.1-12.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["curl-7.71.1-12.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libcurl-7.71.1-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","curl-debuginfo-7.71.1-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","curl-debugsource-7.71.1-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libcurl-devel-7.71.1-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","curl-7.71.1-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1506.json"}},{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/curl&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.71.1-12.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libcurl-devel-7.71.1-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","curl-debuginfo-7.71.1-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","curl-7.71.1-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","curl-debugsource-7.71.1-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libcurl-7.71.1-12.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["curl-help-7.71.1-12.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["curl-7.71.1-12.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["curl-debuginfo-7.71.1-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libcurl-devel-7.71.1-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","curl-debugsource-7.71.1-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","curl-7.71.1-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libcurl-7.71.1-12.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1506.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2022-1506"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22923"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22922"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
