The panic happens in br_dev_queue_push_xmit() once it receives a corrupted skb with ETH header already pushed in linear data. When it attempts the skb_push() call, there's not enough headroom and skb_push() panics.  The corrupted skb is put on the queue by HSR layer, which makes a sequence of unintended transformations when it receives a specific corrupted HSR frame (with incomplete TAG).  Fix it by dropping and consuming frames that are not long enough to contain both ethernet and hsr headers.  Alternative fix would be to check for enough headroom before skb_push() in br_dev_queue_push_xmit().  In the reproducer, this is injected via AF_PACKET, but I don't easily see why it couldn't be sent over the wire from adjacent network.
