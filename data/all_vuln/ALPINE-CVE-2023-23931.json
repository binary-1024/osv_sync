In affected versions `Cipher.update_into` would accept Python objects which implement the buffer protocol, but provide only immutable buffers. This would allow immutable objects (such as `bytes`) to be mutated, thus violating fundamental rules of Python and resulting in corrupted output. This now correctly raises an exception. This issue has been present since `update_into` was originally introduced in cryptography 1.8.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"py3-cryptography","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.23","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-cryptography?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"39.0.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["0.6.1-r0","0.8.2-r0","1.0.2-r0","1.3.1-r0","1.3.2-r0","1.4-r0","1.4-r1","1.4-r2","1.5.2-r0","1.5.2-r1","1.5.3-r0","1.7.2-r0","1.7.2-r1","1.8.1-r0","1.8.1-r1","1.9-r0","2.0.2-r0","2.0.3-r0","2.0.3-r1","2.1.3-r0","2.1.4-r0","2.1.4-r1","2.2.2-r0","2.3.1-r0","2.3.1-r1","2.4.2-r0","2.4.2-r1","2.4.2-r2","2.5-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.6.1-r1","2.7-r0","2.7-r1","2.8-r0","2.8-r1","2.9-r0","2.9.2-r0","3.2.1-r0","3.3-r0","3.3.1-r0","3.3.2-r0","3.3.2-r1","3.3.2-r2","3.3.2-r3","3.3.2-r4","3.4.8-r0","3.4.8-r1","37.0.4-r0","37.0.4-r1","37.0.4-r2","38.0.1-r0","38.0.2-r0","38.0.3-r0","38.0.3-r1","38.0.4-r0","39.0.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2023-23931.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2023-23931"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L"}]}
