More specifically, the parsing of user provided XML files was performed before the ACL checks. A malicious user with limited permissions could exploit this flaw by submitting a specially crafted XML file, causing libvirt to allocate too much memory on the host. The excessive memory consumption could lead to a libvirt process crash on the host, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libvirt","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libvirt?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["10.0.0-1","10.0.0-2","10.0.0-3","10.1.0-1","10.10.0-1","10.10.0-2","10.10.0-3","10.10.0-4","10.2.0-1","10.3.0-1","10.3.0-2","10.3.0-3","10.4.0-1","10.5.0-1","10.6.0-1","10.6.0-2","10.6.0-3","10.7.0-1","10.7.0-2","10.7.0-3","10.8.0-1","10.9.0-1","10.9.0-2","11.0.0-1","11.0.0-2","11.1.0-1","11.1.0-2","11.10.0-1","11.10.0-2","11.2.0-1","11.2.0-2","11.2.0-3","11.3.0-1","11.3.0-2","11.3.0-2~bpo12+1","11.3.0-3","11.4.0-1","11.5.0-1","11.6.0-1","11.7.0-1","11.8.0-1","11.8.0-2","11.9.0-1","11.9.0-2","7.0.0-3","7.0.0-3+deb11u1","7.0.0-3+deb11u2","7.0.0-3+deb11u3","7.10.0-1","7.10.0-2","7.10.0-3","7.6.0-1","7.9.0-1","8.0.0-1","8.0.0-1~bpo11+1","8.1.0-1","8.1.0-2","8.10.0-1","8.10.0-2","8.10.0-3","8.2.0-1","8.3.0-1","8.4.0-1","8.5.0-1","8.5.0-2","8.9.0-1","9.0.0-1","9.0.0-2","9.0.0-3","9.0.0-4","9.1.0-1","9.10.0-1","9.2.0-1","9.2.0-2","9.3.0-1","9.3.0-2","9.4.0-1","9.5.0-1","9.5.0-2","9.6.0-1","9.6.0-2","9.6.0-3","9.7.0-1","9.8.0-1","9.8.0-2","9.9.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-12748.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libvirt","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libvirt?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["10.0.0-1","10.0.0-2","10.0.0-3","10.1.0-1","10.10.0-1","10.10.0-2","10.10.0-3","10.10.0-4","10.2.0-1","10.3.0-1","10.3.0-2","10.3.0-3","10.4.0-1","10.5.0-1","10.6.0-1","10.6.0-2","10.6.0-3","10.7.0-1","10.7.0-2","10.7.0-3","10.8.0-1","10.9.0-1","10.9.0-2","11.0.0-1","11.0.0-2","11.1.0-1","11.1.0-2","11.10.0-1","11.10.0-2","11.2.0-1","11.2.0-2","11.2.0-3","11.3.0-1","11.3.0-2","11.3.0-2~bpo12+1","11.3.0-3","11.4.0-1","11.5.0-1","11.6.0-1","11.7.0-1","11.8.0-1","11.8.0-2","11.9.0-1","11.9.0-2","9.0.0-4","9.0.0-4+deb12u1","9.0.0-4+deb12u2","9.1.0-1","9.10.0-1","9.2.0-1","9.2.0-2","9.3.0-1","9.3.0-2","9.4.0-1","9.5.0-1","9.5.0-2","9.6.0-1","9.6.0-2","9.6.0-3","9.7.0-1","9.8.0-1","9.8.0-2","9.9.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-12748.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libvirt","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libvirt?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"11.3.0-3+deb13u2"}]}],"versions":["11.3.0-3","11.3.0-3+deb13u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-12748.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libvirt","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libvirt?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"11.10.0-1"}]}],"versions":["11.3.0-3","11.4.0-1","11.5.0-1","11.6.0-1","11.7.0-1","11.8.0-1","11.8.0-2","11.9.0-1","11.9.0-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-12748.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-12748"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
