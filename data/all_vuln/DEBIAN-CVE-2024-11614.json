This issue enables an untrusted or compromised guest to crash the hypervisor's vSwitch by forging Virtio descriptors to cause out-of-bounds reads. This flaw allows an attacker with a malicious VM using a virtio driver to cause the vhost-user side to crash by sending a packet with a Tx checksum offload request and an invalid csum_start offset.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"dpdk","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dpdk?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"22.11.7-1~deb12u1"}]}],"versions":["22.11.1-2","22.11.2-1","22.11.2-2","22.11.2-2~deb12u1","22.11.2-3","22.11.3-1","22.11.3-1~deb12u1","22.11.3-2","22.11.4-1~deb12u1","22.11.5-1~deb12u1","22.11.6-1~deb12u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-11614.json"}},{"package":{"name":"dpdk","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dpdk?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"24.11.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-11614.json"}},{"package":{"name":"dpdk","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/dpdk?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"24.11.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-11614.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-11614"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
