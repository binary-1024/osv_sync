{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-21958","published":"2025-04-01T16:15:27Z","modified":"2025-09-25T04:32:21.732259Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-21958"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert \"openvswitch: switch to per-action label counting in conntrack\"  Currently, ovs_ct_set_labels() is only called for confirmed conntrack entries (ct) within ovs_ct_commit(). However, if the conntrack entry does not have the labels_ext extension, attempting to allocate it in ovs_ct_get_conn_labels() for a confirmed entry triggers a warning in nf_ct_ext_add():    WARN_ON(nf_ct_is_confirmed(ct));  This happens when the conntrack entry is created externally before OVS increments net->ct.labels_used. The issue has become more likely since commit fcb1aa5163b1 (\"openvswitch: switch to per-action label counting in conntrack\"), which changed to use per-action label counting and increment net->ct.labels_used when a flow with ct action is added.  Since there’s no straightforward way to fully resolve this issue at the moment, this reverts the commit to avoid breaking existing use cases.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.20-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-21958.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.20-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-21958.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-21958"}]}
