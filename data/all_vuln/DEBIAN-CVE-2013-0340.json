NOTE: it could be argued that because expat already provides the ability to disable external entity expansion, the responsibility for resolving this issue lies with application developers; according to this argument, this entry should be REJECTed, and each affected application would need its own CVE.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"expat","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/expat?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.2.10-2","2.2.10-2+deb11u1","2.2.10-2+deb11u2","2.2.10-2+deb11u3","2.2.10-2+deb11u4","2.2.10-2+deb11u5","2.2.10-2+deb11u6","2.2.10-2+deb11u7","2.3.0-1","2.4.1-1","2.4.1-2","2.4.1-3","2.4.2-1","2.4.3-1","2.4.3-2","2.4.3-3","2.4.4-1","2.4.5-1","2.4.5-2","2.4.6-1","2.4.7-1","2.4.8-1","2.4.8-2","2.4.9-1","2.5.0-1","2.5.0-2","2.6.0-1","2.6.1-1","2.6.1-2","2.6.2-1","2.6.2-2","2.6.3-1","2.6.3-2","2.6.4-1","2.7.0-1","2.7.1-1","2.7.1-2","2.7.2-1","2.7.3-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2013-0340.json"}},{"package":{"name":"expat","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/expat?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.1-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2013-0340.json"}},{"package":{"name":"expat","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/expat?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.1-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2013-0340.json"}},{"package":{"name":"expat","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/expat?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.1-2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2013-0340.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libxmltok","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libxmltok?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.2-4","1.2-4.1","1.2-4.1~exp1","1.2-4.2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2013-0340.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libxmltok","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libxmltok?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.2-4","1.2-4.1","1.2-4.1~exp1","1.2-4.2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2013-0340.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0340"}]}
