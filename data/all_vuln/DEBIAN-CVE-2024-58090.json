{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2024-58090","published":"2025-03-27T15:15:54Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:20:03.528071Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-58090"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched/core: Prevent rescheduling when interrupts are disabled  David reported a warning observed while loop testing kexec jump:    Interrupts enabled after irqrouter_resume+0x0/0x50   WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 560 at drivers/base/syscore.c:103 syscore_resume+0x18a/0x220    kernel_kexec+0xf6/0x180    __do_sys_reboot+0x206/0x250    do_syscall_64+0x95/0x180  The corresponding interrupt flag trace:    hardirqs last  enabled at (15573): [<ffffffffa8281b8e>] __up_console_sem+0x7e/0x90   hardirqs last disabled at (15580): [<ffffffffa8281b73>] __up_console_sem+0x63/0x90  That means __up_console_sem() was invoked with interrupts enabled. Further instrumentation revealed that in the interrupt disabled section of kexec jump one of the syscore_suspend() callbacks woke up a task, which set the NEED_RESCHED flag. A later callback in the resume path invoked cond_resched() which in turn led to the invocation of the scheduler:    __cond_resched+0x21/0x60   down_timeout+0x18/0x60   acpi_os_wait_semaphore+0x4c/0x80   acpi_ut_acquire_mutex+0x3d/0x100   acpi_ns_get_node+0x27/0x60   acpi_ns_evaluate+0x1cb/0x2d0   acpi_rs_set_srs_method_data+0x156/0x190   acpi_pci_link_set+0x11c/0x290   irqrouter_resume+0x54/0x60   syscore_resume+0x6a/0x200   kernel_kexec+0x145/0x1c0   __do_sys_reboot+0xeb/0x240   do_syscall_64+0x95/0x180  This is a long standing problem, which probably got more visible with the recent printk changes. Something does a task wakeup and the scheduler sets the NEED_RESCHED flag. cond_resched() sees it set and invokes schedule() from a completely bogus context. The scheduler enables interrupts after context switching, which causes the above warning at the end.  Quite some of the code paths in syscore_suspend()/resume() can result in triggering a wakeup with the exactly same consequences. They might not have done so yet, but as they share a lot of code with normal operations it's just a question of time.  The problem only affects the PREEMPT_NONE and PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY scheduling models. Full preemption is not affected as cond_resched() is disabled and the preemption check preemptible() takes the interrupt disabled flag into account.  Cure the problem by adding a corresponding check into cond_resched().","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.10.237-1"}]}],"versions":["5.10.103-1","5.10.103-1~bpo10+1","5.10.106-1","5.10.113-1","5.10.120-1","5.10.120-1~bpo10+1","5.10.127-1","5.10.127-2","5.10.127-2~bpo10+1","5.10.136-1","5.10.140-1","5.10.148-1","5.10.149-1","5.10.149-2","5.10.158-1","5.10.158-2","5.10.162-1","5.10.178-1","5.10.178-2","5.10.178-3","5.10.179-1","5.10.179-2","5.10.179-3","5.10.179-4","5.10.179-5","5.10.191-1","5.10.197-1","5.10.205-1","5.10.205-2","5.10.209-1","5.10.209-2","5.10.216-1","5.10.218-1","5.10.221-1","5.10.223-1","5.10.226-1","5.10.234-1","5.10.46-4","5.10.46-5","5.10.70-1","5.10.70-1~bpo10+1","5.10.84-1","5.10.92-1","5.10.92-1~bpo10+1","5.10.92-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-58090.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.133-1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.106-1","6.1.106-2","6.1.106-3","6.1.112-1","6.1.115-1","6.1.119-1","6.1.123-1","6.1.124-1","6.1.128-1","6.1.129-1","6.1.27-1","6.1.37-1","6.1.38-1","6.1.38-2","6.1.38-2~bpo11+1","6.1.38-3","6.1.38-4","6.1.38-4~bpo11+1","6.1.52-1","6.1.55-1","6.1.55-1~bpo11+1","6.1.64-1","6.1.66-1","6.1.67-1","6.1.69-1","6.1.69-1~bpo11+1","6.1.76-1","6.1.76-1~bpo11+1","6.1.82-1","6.1.85-1","6.1.90-1","6.1.90-1~bpo11+1","6.1.94-1","6.1.94-1~bpo11+1","6.1.98-1","6.1.99-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-58090.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.19-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-58090.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.19-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-58090.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux-6.1","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-6.1?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.137-1~deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.106-3~deb11u1","6.1.106-3~deb11u2","6.1.106-3~deb11u3","6.1.112-1~deb11u1","6.1.119-1~deb11u1","6.1.128-1~deb11u1","6.1.129-1~deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-58090.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-58090"}]}
