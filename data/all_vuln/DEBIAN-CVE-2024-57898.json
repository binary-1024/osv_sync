However, some functions require the link ID to remain in the valid_links bitmap. One such example is cfg80211_cac_event(). The flow is -  nl80211_remove_link()     cfg80211_remove_link()         ieee80211_del_intf_link()             ieee80211_vif_set_links()                 ieee80211_vif_update_links()                     ieee80211_link_stop()                         cfg80211_cac_event()  cfg80211_cac_event() requires link ID to be present but it is cleared already in cfg80211_remove_link(). Ultimately, WARN_ON() is hit.  Therefore, clear the link ID from the bitmap only after completing the link clean-up.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.9-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-57898.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.12.9-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-57898.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-57898"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
