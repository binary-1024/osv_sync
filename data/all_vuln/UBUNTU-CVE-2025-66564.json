Prior to 2.0.3, Function api.ParseJSONRequest currently splits (via a call to strings.Split) an optionally-provided OID (which is untrusted data) on periods. Similarly, function api.getContentType splits the Content-Type header (which is also untrusted data) on an application string. As a result, in the face of a malicious request with either an excessively long OID in the payload containing many period characters or a malformed Content-Type header, a call to api.ParseJSONRequest or api.getContentType incurs allocations of O(n) bytes (where n stands for the length of the function's argument). This vulnerability is fixed in 2.0.3.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"golang-github-sigstore-timestamp-authority","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:25.10","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/golang-github-sigstore-timestamp-authority@1.2.3-2?arch=source&distro=questing"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.3-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"golang-github-sigstore-timestamp-authority-dev","binary_version":"1.2.3-2"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2025/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-66564.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-66564"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66564"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/sigstore/timestamp-authority/commit/0cae34e197d685a14904e0bad135b89d13b69421"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/sigstore/timestamp-authority/security/advisories/GHSA-4qg8-fj49-pxjh"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
