This will lead to infinite readdir combine with rename happened at the same time, which fail generic/736 in xfstests(detail show as below).  1. create 5000 files(1 2 3...) under one dir 2. call readdir(man 3 readdir) once, and get one entry 3. rename(entry, \"TEMPFILE\"), then rename(\"TEMPFILE\", entry) 4. loop 2~3, until readdir return nothing or we loop too many    times(tmpfs break test with the second condition)  We choose the same logic what commit 9b378f6ad48cf (\"btrfs: fix infinite directory reads\") to fix it, record the last_index when we open dir, and do not emit the entry which index >= last_index. The file->private_data now used in offset dir can use directly to do this, and we also update the last_index when we llseek the dir file.  [brauner: only update last_index after seek when offset is zero like Jan suggested]","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.10.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-46701.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.10.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-46701.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-46701"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
