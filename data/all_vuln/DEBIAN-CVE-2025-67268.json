{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-67268","published":"2026-01-02T16:17:00.990Z","modified":"2026-01-22T04:16:11.048462Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-67268"],"details":"gpsd before commit dc966aa contains a heap-based out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the drivers/driver_nmea2000.c file. The hnd_129540 function, which handles NMEA2000 PGN 129540 (GNSS Satellites in View) packets, fails to validate the user-supplied satellite count against the size of the skyview array (184 elements). This allows an attacker to write beyond the bounds of the array by providing a satellite count up to 255, leading to memory corruption, Denial of Service (DoS), and potentially arbitrary code execution.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gpsd","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gpsd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.22-4+deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["3.22-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-67268.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gpsd","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gpsd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.22-4.1","3.25-1","3.25-1~exp1","3.25-1~exp2","3.25-2","3.25-2.1~exp1","3.25-3","3.25-3~exp1","3.25-4","3.25-5","3.26.1-1","3.27-1","3.27-1.1","3.27.5-0.1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-67268.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gpsd","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gpsd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.25-5","3.26.1-1","3.27-1","3.27-1.1","3.27.5-0.1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-67268.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gpsd","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/gpsd?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.27.5-0.1"}]}],"versions":["3.25-5","3.26.1-1","3.27-1","3.27-1.1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-67268.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-67268"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
