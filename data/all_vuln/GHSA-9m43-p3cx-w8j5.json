Malcontent uses [google/go-containerregistry](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry) for OCI image pulls, which by default uses the Docker credential keychain. A malicious registry could return a `WWW-Authenticate` header redirecting token authentication to an attacker-controlled endpoint, causing credentials to be sent to that endpoint.\n\n**Fix:** [Default to anonymous auth for OCI pulls](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/malcontent/commit/538ed00cdc639d687a4bd1e843a2be0428a3b3e7)\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\nThank you to Oleh Konko from [1seal](https://1seal.org/) for discovering and reporting this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/chainguard-dev/malcontent","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/chainguard-dev/malcontent"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.10.0"},{"fixed":"1.20.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-9m43-p3cx-w8j5/GHSA-9m43-p3cx-w8j5.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/chainguard-dev/malcontent/security/advisories/GHSA-9m43-p3cx-w8j5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24845"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/chainguard-dev/malcontent/commit/538ed00cdc639d687a4bd1e843a2be0428a3b3e7"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/chainguard-dev/malcontent"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-522"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-29T22:04:24Z","nvd_published_at":"2026-01-29T22:15:54Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
