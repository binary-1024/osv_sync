Separately, statistics allow a user to read sampled data that a row security policy intended to hide.  PostgreSQL maintains statistics for tables by sampling data available in columns; this data is consulted during the query planning process.  Prior to this release, a user could craft a leaky operator that bypassed view access control lists (ACLs) and bypassed row security policies in partitioning or table inheritance hierarchies.  Reachable statistics data notably included histograms and most-common-values lists.  CVE-2017-7484 and CVE-2019-10130 intended to close this class of vulnerability, but this gap remained.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.6, 16.10, 15.14, 14.19, and 13.22 are affected.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"postgresql-13","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/postgresql-13?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"13.22-0+deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["13.10-0+deb11u1","13.11-0+deb11u1","13.12-0+deb11u1","13.13-0+deb11u1","13.14-0+deb11u1","13.15-0+deb11u1","13.16-0+deb11u1","13.17-0+deb11u1","13.18-0+deb11u1","13.19-0+deb11u1","13.20-0+deb11u1","13.21-0+deb11u1","13.3-1","13.4-0+deb11u1","13.4-1","13.4-2","13.4-3","13.5-0+deb11u1","13.7-0+deb11u1","13.8-0+deb11u1","13.9-0+deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-8713.json"}},{"package":{"name":"postgresql-15","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/postgresql-15?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"15.14-0+deb12u1"}]}],"versions":["15.10-0+deb12u1","15.11-0+deb12u1","15.12-0+deb12u1","15.12-0+deb12u2","15.13-0+deb12u1","15.3-0+deb12u1","15.3-1","15.4-0+deb12u1","15.4-1","15.4-2","15.4-3","15.5-0+deb12u1","15.6-0+deb12u1","15.7-0+deb12u1","15.8-0+deb12u1","15.9-0+deb12u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-8713.json"}},{"package":{"name":"postgresql-17","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/postgresql-17?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"17.6-0+deb13u1"}]}],"versions":["17.5-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-8713.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-8713"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
