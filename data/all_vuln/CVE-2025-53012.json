In version 1.39.2, nested imports of MaterialX files can lead to a crash via stack memory exhaustion, due to the lack of a limit on the \"import chain\" depth. When parsing file imports, recursion is used to process nested files; however, there is no limit imposed to the depth of files that can be parsed by the library. By building a sufficiently deep chain of MaterialX files one referencing the next, it is possible to crash the process using the MaterialX library via stack exhaustion. This is fixed in version 1.39.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/academysoftwarefoundation/materialx","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3b79bd735036dc96942836a9d076b6af3bd8fbdf"}]}],"versions":["v1.35.2","v1.35.3","v1.35.4","v1.35.5","v1.36.0","v1.36.1","v1.36.2","v1.36.3","v1.36.4","v1.36.5","v1.37.0","v1.37.1","v1.37.2","v1.37.3","v1.37.4","v1.38.0","v1.38.1","v1.38.10","v1.38.2","v1.38.3","v1.38.4","v1.38.5","v1.38.6","v1.38.7","v1.38.8","v1.38.9","v1.39.0","v1.39.1","v1.39.1-rc1","v1.39.1-rc2","v1.39.2","v1.39.2-rc1","v1.39.3-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53012.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/MaterialX/blob/main/documents/Specification/MaterialX.Specification.md#mtlx-file-format-definition"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/MaterialX/pull/2233/commits/6182c07467297416a30d148ab531d81198686dc5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/MaterialX/releases/tag/v1.39.3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/MaterialX/security/advisories/GHSA-qc2h-74x3-4v3w"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
