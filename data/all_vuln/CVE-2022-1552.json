  "details": "A flaw was found in PostgreSQL. There is an issue with incomplete efforts to operate safely when a privileged user is maintaining another user's objects. The Autovacuum, REINDEX, CREATE INDEX, REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW, CLUSTER, and pg_amcheck commands activated relevant protections too late or not at all during the process. This flaw allows an attacker with permission to create non-temporary objects in at least one schema to execute arbitrary SQL functions under a superuser identity.",
