A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way sudo parses command line arguments. This flaw is exploitable by any local user (normal users and system users, sudoers and non-sudoers), without authentication (i.e., the attacker does not need to know the user's password). Successful exploitation of this flaw could lead to privilege escalation. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.(CVE-2021-3156)\\r\\n\\r\\n\nThe sudoedit personality of Sudo before 1.9.5 may allow a local unprivileged user to perform arbitrary directory-existence tests by winning a sudo_edit.c race condition in replacing a user-controlled directory by a symlink to an arbitrary path.(CVE-2021-23239)\\r\\n\\r\\n\nselinux_edit_copy_tfiles in sudoedit in Sudo before 1.9.5 allows a local unprivileged user to gain file ownership and escalate privileges by replacing a temporary file with a symlink to an arbitrary file target. This affects SELinux RBAC support in permissive mode. Machines without SELinux are not vulnerable.(CVE-2021-23240)\\r\\n\\r\\n\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"sudo","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/sudo&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.2-3.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["sudo-1.9.2-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","sudo-debuginfo-1.9.2-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","sudo-debugsource-1.9.2-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","sudo-devel-1.9.2-2.oe1.aarch64.rpm","sudo-help-1.9.2-2.oe1.noarch.rpm","sudo-1.9.2-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","sudo-debuginfo-1.9.2-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","sudo-debugsource-1.9.2-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","sudo-devel-1.9.2-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","sudo-help-1.9.2-3.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["sudo-1.9.2-2.oe1.src.rpm","sudo-1.9.2-3.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["sudo-1.9.2-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","sudo-debuginfo-1.9.2-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","sudo-debugsource-1.9.2-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","sudo-devel-1.9.2-2.oe1.x86_64.rpm","sudo-help-1.9.2-2.oe1.noarch.rpm","sudo-1.9.2-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","sudo-debuginfo-1.9.2-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","sudo-debugsource-1.9.2-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","sudo-devel-1.9.2-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","sudo-help-1.9.2-3.oe1.noarch.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1002.json"}},{"package":{"name":"sudo","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/sudo&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.2-3.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["sudo-1.9.2-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","sudo-debuginfo-1.9.2-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","sudo-debugsource-1.9.2-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","sudo-devel-1.9.2-3.oe1.aarch64.rpm","sudo-help-1.9.2-3.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["sudo-1.9.2-3.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["sudo-1.9.2-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","sudo-debuginfo-1.9.2-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","sudo-debugsource-1.9.2-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","sudo-devel-1.9.2-3.oe1.x86_64.rpm","sudo-help-1.9.2-3.oe1.noarch.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1002.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1002"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3156"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23239"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23240"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
