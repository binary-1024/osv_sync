It occurs when dropping packets during a bulk transfer from a SPICE client due to the packet queue being full. A malicious SPICE client could use this flaw to make QEMU call free() with faked heap chunk metadata, resulting in a crash of QEMU or potential code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process on the host.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"qemu","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/qemu?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:5.2+dfsg-11+deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["1:5.2+dfsg-11"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-3682.json"}},{"package":{"name":"qemu","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/qemu?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:6.0+dfsg-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-3682.json"}},{"package":{"name":"qemu","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/qemu?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:6.0+dfsg-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-3682.json"}},{"package":{"name":"qemu","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/qemu?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:6.0+dfsg-3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2021-3682.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3682"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
