Prior to version 3.5.29, the MMRDecoder::scanruns method is affected by an OOB-write vulnerability, because it does not check that the xr pointer stays within the bounds of the allocated buffer. This can lead to writes beyond the allocated memory, resulting in a heap corruption condition. An out-of-bounds read with pr is also possible for the same reason. This issue has been patched in version 3.5.29.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53367.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.5.29"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2025-055_DjVuLibre/"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/cve-2025-53367-an-exploitable-out-of-bounds-write-in-djvulibre"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/cve-2025-53367-an-exploitable-out-of-bounds-write-in-djvulibre/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/github/securitylab/tree/main/SecurityExploits/DjVuLibre/MMRDecoder_scanruns_CVE-2025-53367"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://sourceforge.net/p/djvu/djvulibre-git/ci/33f645196593d70bd5e37f55b63886c31c82c3da"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/07/03/1"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
