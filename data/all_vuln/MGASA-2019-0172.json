  "details": "This kernel update provides the upstream 4.14.119 that adds the kernel side\nmitigations for the Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS, also called\nZombieLoad attack) vulnerabilities in Intel processors that can allow\nattackers to retrieve data being processed inside a CPU. To complete the\nmitigations new microcode is also needed, either by installing the\nmicrocode-0.20190514-1.mga6 package, or get an updated bios / uefi\nfirmware from the motherboard vendor.\n\nThe fixed / mitigated issues are:\n\nModern Intel microprocessors implement hardware-level micro-optimizations\nto improve the performance of writing data back to CPU caches. The write\noperation is split into STA (STore Address) and STD (STore Data)\nsub-operations. These sub-operations allow the processor to hand-off\naddress generation logic into these sub-operations for optimized writes.\nBoth of these sub-operations write to a shared distributed processor\nstructure called the 'processor store buffer'. As a result, an\nunprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read private data resident\nwithin the CPU's processor store buffer. (CVE-2018-12126)\n\nMicroprocessors use a \u2018load port\u2019 subcomponent to perform load operations\nfrom memory or IO. During a load operation, the load port receives data\nfrom the memory or IO subsystem and then provides the data to the CPU\nregisters and operations in the CPU\u2019s pipelines. Stale load operations\nresults are stored in the 'load port' table until overwritten by newer\noperations. Certain load-port operations triggered by an attacker can be\nused to reveal data about previous stale requests leaking data back to the\nattacker via a timing side-channel. (CVE-2018-12127)\n\nA flaw was found in the implementation of the \"fill buffer\", a mechanism\nused by modern CPUs when a cache-miss is made on L1 CPU cache. If an\nattacker can generate a load operation that would create a page fault,\nthe execution will continue speculatively with incorrect data from the\nfill buffer while the data is fetched from higher level caches. This\nresponse time can be measured to infer data in the fill buffer.\n(CVE-2018-12130)\n\nUncacheable memory on some microprocessors utilizing speculative execution\nmay allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure\nvia a side channel with local access. (CVE-2019-11091)\n\n\nIt also fixes at least the following security issues:\n\nLinux Linux kernel version at least v4.8 onwards, probably well before\ncontains a Insufficient input validation vulnerability in bnx2x network\ncard driver that can result in DoS: Network card firmware assertion takes\ncard off-line. This attack appear to be exploitable via An attacker on a\nmust pass a very large, specially crafted packet to the bnx2x card.\nThis can be done from an untrusted guest VM (CVE-2018-1000026)\n\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's vfio interface implementation that\npermits violation of the user's locked memory limit. If a device is bound\nto a vfio driver, such as vfio-pci, and the local attacker is\nadministratively granted ownership of the device, it may cause a system\nmemory exhaustion and thus a denial of service (DoS) (CVE-2019-3882).\n\nkernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel before 4.20.6 performs undesirable\nout-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic in various cases, including\ncases of different branches with different state or limits to sanitize,\nleading to side-channel attacks (CVE-2019-7308).\n\nIn the Linux kernel before 4.20.14, expand_downwards in mm/mmap.c lacks\na check for the mmap minimum address, which makes it easier for attackers\nto exploit kernel NULL pointer dereferences on non-SMAP platforms. This is\nrelated to a capability check for the wrong task (CVE-2019-9213).\n\nThe Siemens R3964 line discipline driver in drivers/tty/n_r3964.c in the\nLinux kernel before 5.0.8 has multiple race conditions (CVE-2019-11486).\n\nThe coredump implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.0.10 does not use\nlocking or other mechanisms to prevent vma layout or vma flags changes while\nit runs, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information, cause a\ndenial of service, or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering\na race condition with mmget_not_zero or get_task_mm calls (CVE-2019-11599).\n\nIt also fixes signal handling issues causing powertop to crash and some\ntracing tools to fail on execve tests.\n\nFor other uptstream fixes in this update, see the referenced changelogs.\n",
