When a local user in the guest writes an executable file with SUID or SGID, none of these privileged bits are correctly dropped. As a result, in rare circumstances, this flaw could be used by malicious users in the guest to elevate their privileges within the guest and help a host local user to elevate privileges on the host.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-1386"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2223985"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ppj8-867g-rgjr"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230831-0005/"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/v9fs/linux/issues/29"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
