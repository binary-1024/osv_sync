{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-22607","published":"2026-01-10T02:15:49.780Z","modified":"2026-01-11T03:50:53.484738Z","aliases":["GHSA-p523-jq9w-64x9"],"details":"Fickling is a Python pickling decompiler and static analyzer. Fickling versions up to and including 0.1.6 do not treat Python's cProfile module as unsafe. Because of this, a malicious pickle that uses cProfile.run() is classified as SUSPICIOUS instead of OVERTLY_MALICIOUS. If a user relies on Fickling's output to decide whether a pickle is safe to deserialize, this misclassification can lead them to execute attacker-controlled code on their system. This affects any workflow or product that uses Fickling as a security gate for pickle deserialization. This issue has been patched in version 0.1.7.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"977b0769c13537cd96549c12bb537f05464cf09c"},{"fixed":"dc8ae12966edee27a78fe05c5745171a2b138d43"}]}],"versions":["master","v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22607.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/releases/tag/v0.1.7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/security/advisories/GHSA-p523-jq9w-64x9"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/commit/dc8ae12966edee27a78fe05c5745171a2b138d43"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
