  "summary": "Updated swtpm packages fix security vulnerability",
  "details": "swtpm is a libtpms-based TPM emulator with socket, character device, and\nLinux CUSE interface. Versions prior to 0.5.3, 0.6.2, and 0.7.1 are\nvulnerable to out-of-bounds read. A specially crafted header of swtpm's\nstate, where the blobheader's hdrsize indicator has an invalid value, may\ncause an out-of-bounds access when the byte array representing the state\nof the TPM is accessed. This will likely crash swtpm or prevent it from\nstarting since the state cannot be understood. Users should upgrade to\nswtpm v0.5.3, v0.6.2, or v0.7.1 to receive a patch. There are currently no\nknown workarounds. (CVE-2022-23645)\n",
