Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nNode.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when too many connection attempts with an &apos;unknownProtocol&apos; are established. This leads to a leak of file descriptors. If a file descriptor limit is configured on the system, then the server is unable to accept new connections and prevent the process also from opening, e.g. a file. If no file descriptor limit is configured, then this lead to an excessive memory usage and cause the system to run out of memory.(CVE-2021-22883)\r\n\r\nNode.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks as the whitelist includes “localhost6”. When “localhost6” is not present in /etc/hosts, it is just an ordinary domain that is resolved via DNS, i.e., over network. If the attacker controls the victim&apos;s DNS server or can spoof its responses, the DNS rebinding protection can be bypassed by using the “localhost6” domain. As long as the attacker uses the “localhost6” domain, they can still apply the attack described in CVE-2018-7160.(CVE-2021-22884)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nodejs","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/nodejs&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"10.21.0-7.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["npm-6.14.4-1.10.21.0.6.oe1.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-libs-10.21.0-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-debugsource-10.21.0-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-full-i18n-10.21.0-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-10.21.0-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-debuginfo-10.21.0-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-devel-10.21.0-6.oe1.aarch64.rpm","v8-devel-6.8.275.32-1.10.21.0.6.oe1.aarch64.rpm","npm-6.14.4-1.10.21.0.7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-debuginfo-10.21.0-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","v8-devel-6.8.275.32-1.10.21.0.7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-full-i18n-10.21.0-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-devel-10.21.0-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-10.21.0-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-debugsource-10.21.0-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-libs-10.21.0-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["nodejs-docs-10.21.0-6.oe1.noarch.rpm","nodejs-docs-10.21.0-7.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["nodejs-10.21.0-6.oe1.src.rpm","nodejs-10.21.0-7.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["v8-devel-6.8.275.32-1.10.21.0.6.oe1.x86_64.rpm","nodejs-full-i18n-10.21.0-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm","nodejs-10.21.0-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm","nodejs-debugsource-10.21.0-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm","nodejs-libs-10.21.0-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm","nodejs-devel-10.21.0-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm","nodejs-debuginfo-10.21.0-6.oe1.x86_64.rpm","npm-6.14.4-1.10.21.0.6.oe1.x86_64.rpm","nodejs-libs-10.21.0-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","nodejs-debugsource-10.21.0-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","nodejs-debuginfo-10.21.0-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","nodejs-full-i18n-10.21.0-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","nodejs-devel-10.21.0-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","v8-devel-6.8.275.32-1.10.21.0.7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","npm-6.14.4-1.10.21.0.7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","nodejs-10.21.0-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1114.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nodejs","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/nodejs&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"10.21.0-7.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["npm-6.14.4-1.10.21.0.7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-debuginfo-10.21.0-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","v8-devel-6.8.275.32-1.10.21.0.7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-full-i18n-10.21.0-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-devel-10.21.0-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-10.21.0-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-debugsource-10.21.0-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm","nodejs-libs-10.21.0-7.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["nodejs-docs-10.21.0-7.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["nodejs-10.21.0-7.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["nodejs-libs-10.21.0-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","nodejs-debugsource-10.21.0-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","nodejs-debuginfo-10.21.0-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","nodejs-full-i18n-10.21.0-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","nodejs-devel-10.21.0-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","v8-devel-6.8.275.32-1.10.21.0.7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","npm-6.14.4-1.10.21.0.7.oe1.x86_64.rpm","nodejs-10.21.0-7.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1114.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1114"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22883"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22884"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
