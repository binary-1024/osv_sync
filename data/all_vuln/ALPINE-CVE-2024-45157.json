Unlike previously documented, enabling MBEDTLS_PSA_HMAC_DRBG_MD_TYPE does not cause the PSA subsystem to use HMAC_DRBG: it uses HMAC_DRBG only when MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_EXTERNAL_RNG and MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_C are disabled.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.28.9-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.10-r0","2.16.10-r1","2.16.12-r0","2.16.12-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.16.6-r0","2.16.8-r0","2.16.9-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.1-r0","2.28.2-r0","2.28.3-r0","2.28.4-r0","2.28.5-r0","2.28.7-r0","2.28.8-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-45157.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.28.9-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.10-r0","2.16.10-r1","2.16.12-r0","2.16.12-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.16.6-r0","2.16.8-r0","2.16.9-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.1-r0","2.28.1-r1","2.28.2-r0","2.28.3-r0","2.28.3-r1","2.28.4-r0","2.28.5-r0","2.28.7-r0","2.28.8-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-45157.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.28.9-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.10-r0","2.16.10-r1","2.16.12-r0","2.16.12-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.16.6-r0","2.16.8-r0","2.16.9-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.1-r0","2.28.1-r1","2.28.2-r0","2.28.3-r0","2.28.3-r1","2.28.3-r2","2.28.3-r3","2.28.4-r0","2.28.5-r0","2.28.6-r0","2.28.7-r0","2.28.8-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-45157.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.10-r0","2.16.10-r1","2.16.12-r0","2.16.12-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.16.6-r0","2.16.8-r0","2.16.9-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.1-r0","2.28.1-r1","2.28.2-r0","2.28.3-r0","2.28.3-r1","2.28.3-r2","2.28.3-r3","2.28.4-r0","2.28.5-r0","2.28.6-r0","2.28.7-r0","2.28.8-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0","3.6.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-45157.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.10-r0","2.16.10-r1","2.16.12-r0","2.16.12-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.16.6-r0","2.16.8-r0","2.16.9-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.1-r0","2.28.1-r1","2.28.2-r0","2.28.3-r0","2.28.3-r1","2.28.3-r2","2.28.3-r3","2.28.4-r0","2.28.5-r0","2.28.6-r0","2.28.7-r0","2.28.8-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0","3.6.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-45157.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.1-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.10-r0","2.16.10-r1","2.16.12-r0","2.16.12-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.16.6-r0","2.16.8-r0","2.16.9-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.1-r0","2.28.1-r1","2.28.2-r0","2.28.3-r0","2.28.3-r1","2.28.3-r2","2.28.3-r3","2.28.4-r0","2.28.5-r0","2.28.6-r0","2.28.7-r0","2.28.8-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0","3.6.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-45157.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2024-45157"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/
