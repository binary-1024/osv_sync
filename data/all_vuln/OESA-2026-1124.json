Prior to 1.6.52, an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in libpng&apos;s simplified API allows reading up to 1012 bytes beyond the png_sRGB_base[512] array when processing valid palette PNG images with partial transparency and gamma correction. The PNG files that trigger this vulnerability are valid per the PNG specification; the bug is in libpng&apos;s internal state management.
