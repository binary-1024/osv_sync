  "summary": "Malicious plugin names, recipients, or identities can cause arbitrary binary execution",
  "details": "A plugin name containing a path separator may allow an attacker to execute an arbitrary\nbinary.\n\nSuch a plugin name can be provided to the `rage` CLI through an attacker-controlled\nrecipient or identity string, or an attacker-controlled plugin name via the `-j` flag.\n\nOn UNIX systems, a directory matching `age-plugin-*` needs to exist in the working\ndirectory for the attack to succeed.\n\nThe binary is executed with a single flag, either `--age-plugin=recipient-v1` or\n`--age-plugin=identity-v1`. The standard input includes the recipient or identity string,\nand the random file key (if encrypting) or the header of the file (if decrypting). The\nformat is constrained by the [age-plugin](https://c2sp.org/age-plugin) protocol.\n\nAn equivalent issue was fixed in [the reference Go implementation of age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age),\nsee advisory [GHSA-32gq-x56h-299c](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/security/advisories/GHSA-32gq-x56h-299c).\n\nThanks to \u2b21-49016 for reporting this issue.",
