It is possible to bypass the existing security measures put in place to avoid open redirect by using a redirect such as `//mydomain.com` (i.e. omitting the `http:`). It was also possible to bypass it when using URL such as `http:/mydomain.com`. The problem has been patched on XWiki 13.10.10, 14.4.4 and 14.8RC1.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons","events":[{"introduced":"a54424640068c0da4820bb6892cd61be80ae19a0"},{"fixed":"bc18e50bcf9ea40d1e25ff8d065b3178c8247f16"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-29204.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform","events":[{"introduced":"319c08271dd01a9c10ce91d144602ed3ded4b2cc"},{"fixed":"61a67f5cf241df692779d77367168e0762119091"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-29204.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/29xxx/CVE-2023-29204.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/e4f7f68e93cb08c25632c126356d218abf192d1e#diff-c445f288d5d63424f56ef13f65514ab4e174a72e979b53b88197c2b7def267cf"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-xwph-x6xj-wggv"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-10309"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19994"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29204"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-601"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/29xxx/CVE-2023-29204.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
