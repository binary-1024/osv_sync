If the number of events in an event_group is greater than HNS3_PMU_MAX_HW_EVENTS, the memory write overflow of event_group array occurs.  Add array index check to fix the possible array out of bounds violation, and return directly when write new events are written to array bounds.  There are 9 different events in an event_group.
