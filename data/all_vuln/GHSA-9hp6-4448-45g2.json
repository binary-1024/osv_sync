  "details": "### Summary\n\nA flaw in the `getPath` utility function could allow path confusion and potential bypass of proxy-level ACLs (e.g. Nginx location blocks).\n\n### Details\n\nThe original implementation relied on fixed character offsets when parsing request URLs. Under certain malformed absolute-form Request-URIs, this could lead to incorrect path extraction.\n\nMost standards-compliant runtimes and reverse proxies reject such malformed requests with a 400 Bad Request, so the impact depends on the application and environment.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf proxy ACLs are used to protect sensitive endpoints such as `/admin`, this flaw could have allowed unauthorized access. The confidentiality impact depends on what data is exposed: if sensitive administrative data is exposed, the impact may be High (CVSS 7.5); otherwise it may be Medium (CVSS 5.3).\n\n### Resolution\n\nThe implementation has been updated to correctly locate the first slash after \"://\", preventing such path confusion.",
