The extension parser may take quadratic time when parsing a header containing an unclosed string parameter value whose content is a repeating two-byte sequence of a backslash and some other character. This could be abused by an attacker to conduct Regex Denial Of Service (ReDoS) on a single-threaded server by providing a malicious payload with the Sec-WebSocket-Extensions header.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://blog.jcoglan.com/2020/06/02/redos-vulnerability-in-websocket-extensions"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-ruby/commit/aa156a439da681361ed6f53f1a8131892418838b"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-ruby/security/advisories/GHSA-g6wq-qcwm-j5g2"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/08/msg00031.html"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-WEBSOCKETEXTENSIONS-570830"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4502-1/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
