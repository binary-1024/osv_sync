{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2026-23012","published":"2026-01-25T15:15:56.073Z","modified":"2026-01-26T11:16:21.322799Z","upstream":["CVE-2026-23012"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/damon/core: remove call_control in inactive contexts  If damon_call() is executed against a DAMON context that is not running, the function returns error while keeping the damon_call_control object linked to the context's call_controls list.  Let's suppose the object is deallocated after the damon_call(), and yet another damon_call() is executed against the same context.  The function tries to add the new damon_call_control object to the call_controls list, which still has the pointer to the previous damon_call_control object, which is deallocated.  As a result, use-after-free happens.  This can actually be triggered using the DAMON sysfs interface.  It is not easily exploitable since it requires the sysfs write permission and making a definitely weird file writes, though.  Please refer to the report for more details about the issue reproduction steps.  Fix the issue by making two changes.  Firstly, move the final kdamond_call() for cancelling all existing damon_call() requests from terminating DAMON context to be done before the ctx->kdamond reset.  This makes any code that sees NULL ctx->kdamond can safely assume the context may not access damon_call() requests anymore.  Secondly, let damon_call() to cleanup the damon_call_control objects that were added to the already-terminated DAMON context, before returning the error.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.57-1","6.12.57-1~bpo12+1","6.12.63-1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.10-1","6.16.11-1","6.16.12-1","6.16.12-1~bpo13+1","6.16.12-2","6.16.3-1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16.5-1","6.16.6-1","6.16.7-1","6.16.8-1","6.16.9-1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1","6.17.10-1","6.17.11-1","6.17.12-1","6.17.13-1","6.17.13-1~bpo13+1","6.17.2-1~exp1","6.17.5-1~exp1","6.17.6-1","6.17.7-1","6.17.7-2","6.17.8-1","6.17.8-1~bpo13+1","6.17.9-1","6.18.1-1~exp1","6.18.2-1~exp1","6.18.3-1","6.18.5-1","6.18~rc4-1~exp1","6.18~rc4-1~exp2","6.18~rc5-1~exp1","6.18~rc6-1~exp1","6.18~rc7-1~exp1","6.19~rc4-1~exp1","6.19~rc5-1~exp1","6.19~rc6-1~exp1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-23012.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2026-23012"}]}
