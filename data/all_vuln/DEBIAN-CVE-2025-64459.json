The methods `QuerySet.filter()`, `QuerySet.exclude()`, and `QuerySet.get()`, and the class `Q()`, are subject to SQL injection when using a suitably crafted dictionary, with dictionary expansion, as the `_connector` argument. Earlier, unsupported Django series (such as 5.0.x, 4.1.x, and 3.2.x) were not evaluated and may also be affected. Django would like to thank cyberstan for reporting this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-django","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-django?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2:2.2.24-1","2:2.2.25-1~deb11u1","2:2.2.26-1~deb11u1","2:2.2.28-1~deb11u1","2:2.2.28-1~deb11u2","2:2.2.28-1~deb11u3","2:2.2.28-1~deb11u4","2:2.2.28-1~deb11u5","2:2.2.28-1~deb11u6","2:2.2.28-1~deb11u7","2:2.2.28-1~deb11u8","2:2.2.28-1~deb11u9","2:3.0-1","2:3.0.1-1","2:3.0.2-1","2:3.0.4-1","2:3.0.5-1","2:3.0.6-1","2:3.0.7-1","2:3.0.7-2","2:3.0~alpha1-1","2:3.0~beta1-1","2:3.0~rc1-1","2:3.1-1","2:3.1-2","2:3.1.1-1","2:3.1.2-1","2:3.1.3-1","2:3.1.4-1","2:3.1.5-1","2:3.1~beta1-1","2:3.1~rc1-1","2:3.2-1","2:3.2.1-1","2:3.2.10-1","2:3.2.10-2","2:3.2.10-2~bpo11+1","2:3.2.10-2~bpo11+2","2:3.2.11-1","2:3.2.11-2","2:3.2.12-1","2:3.2.12-1~bpo11+1","2:3.2.12-2","2:3.2.13-1","2:3.2.2-1","2:3.2.3-1","2:3.2.4-1","2:3.2.5-1","2:3.2.5-2","2:3.2.6-1","2:3.2.7-1","2:3.2.7-2","2:3.2.7-3","2:3.2.7-4","2:3.2.8-1","2:3.2.9-1","2:3.2.9-2","2:3.2.9-2~bpo11+1","2:3.2~alpha1-1","2:3.2~alpha1-2","2:3.2~beta1-1","2:3.2~rc1-1","2:4.0-1","2:4.0.1-1","2:4.0.1-2","2:4.0.2-1","2:4.0.3-1","2:4.0.4-1","2:4.0.5-1","2:4.0.5-2","2:4.0.6-1","2:4.0~alpha1-1","2:4.0~beta1-1","2:4.0~rc1-1","2:4.1~alpha1-1","2:4.1~beta1-1","2:4.1~rc1-1","3:3.2.14-1","3:3.2.15-1","3:3.2.16-1","3:3.2.16-2","3:3.2.17-1","3:3.2.18-1","3:3.2.19-1","3:3.2.20-1","3:3.2.20-1.1","3:3.2.21-1","3:4.1-1","3:4.1.1-1","3:4.1.2-1","3:4.1.3-1","3:4.1.4-1","3:4.1.5-1","3:4.2-1","3:4.2.1-1","3:4.2.10-1","3:4.2.11-1","3:4.2.13-1","3:4.2.14-1","3:4.2.15-1","3:4.2.15-1~bpo12+1","3:4.2.16-1","3:4.2.17-1","3:4.2.17-2","3:4.2.18-1","3:4.2.18-1~bpo12+1","3:4.2.19-1","3:4.2.19-1~bpo12+1","3:4.2.2-1","3:4.2.20-1","3:4.2.20-1~bpo12+1","3:4.2.21-1","3:4.2.21-1~bpo12+1","3:4.2.22-1","3:4.2.23-1","3:4.2.24-1","3:4.2.25-1","3:4.2.25-2","3:4.2.26-1","3:4.2.3-1","3:4.2.4-1","3:4.2.5-1","3:4.2.5-2","3:4.2.6-1","3:4.2.8-1","3:4.2.9-1","3:4.2~alpha1-1","3:4.2~beta1-1","3:4.2~rc1-1","3:5.0-1","3:5.0.1-1","3:5.0.2-1","3:5.0.3-1","3:5.0.4-1","3:5.0.6-1","3:5.0~alpha1-1","3:5.0~rc1-1","3:5.1-1","3:5.1.1-1","3:5.1.2-1","3:5.1.3-1","3:5.1.4-1","3:5.1.5-1","3:5.1~alpha1-1","3:5.1~beta1-1","3:5.1~rc1-1","3:5.2-1","3:5.2.1-1","3:5.2.2-1","3:5.2.3-1","3:5.2.4-1","3:5.2.5-1","3:5.2.6-1","3:5.2~alpha1-1","3:5.2~beta1-1","3:5.2~rc1-1","3:6.0~alpha1-1","3:6.0~beta1-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not
