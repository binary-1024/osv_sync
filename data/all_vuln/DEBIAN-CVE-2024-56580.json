  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: qcom: camss: fix error path on configuration of power domains  There is a chance to meet runtime issues during configuration of CAMSS power domains, because on the error path dev_pm_domain_detach() is unexpectedly called with NULL or error pointer.  One of the simplest ways to reproduce the problem is to probe CAMSS driver before registration of CAMSS power domains, for instance if a platform CAMCC driver is simply not built.
