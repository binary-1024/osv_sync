Disable tx napi before deleting it in mt76_dma_cleanup().   WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 18828 at net/core/dev.c:7288 __netif_napi_del_locked+0xf0/0x100  CPU: 4 UID: 0 PID: 18828 Comm: modprobe Not tainted 6.15.0-rc4 #4 PREEMPT(lazy)  Hardware name: ASUS System Product Name/PRIME X670E-PRO WIFI, BIOS 3035 09/05/2024  RIP: 0010:__netif_napi_del_locked+0xf0/0x100  Call Trace:  <TASK>  mt76_dma_cleanup+0x54/0x2f0 [mt76]  mt7921_pci_remove+0xd5/0x190 [mt7921e]  pci_device_remove+0x47/0xc0  device_release_driver_internal+0x19e/0x200  driver_detach+0x48/0x90  bus_remove_driver+0x6d/0xf0  pci_unregister_driver+0x2e/0xb0  __do_sys_delete_module.isra.0+0x197/0x2e0  do_syscall_64+0x7b/0x160  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e  Tested with mt7921e but the same pattern can be actually applied to other mt76 drivers calling mt76_dma_cleanup() during removal. Tx napi is enabled in their *_dma_init() functions and only toggled off and on again inside their suspend/resume/reset paths. So it should be okay to disable tx napi in such a generic way.
