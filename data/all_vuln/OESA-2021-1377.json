It encrypts all traffic to eliminate eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks. In addition, OpenSSH provides a large suite of secure tunneling capabilities, several authentication methods, and sophisticated configuration options.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nsshd in OpenSSH 6.2 through 8.x before 8.8, when certain non-default configurations are used, allows privilege escalation because supplemental groups are not initialized as expected. Helper programs for AuthorizedKeysCommand and AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand may run with privileges associated with group memberships of the sshd process, if the configuration specifies running the command as a different user.(CVE-2021-41617)\n\nscp in OpenSSH through 8.3p1 allows command injection in scp.c remote function, as demonstrated by backtick characters in the destination argument. NOTE: the vendor reportedly has stated that they intentionally omit validation of anomalous argument transfers because that could stand a great chance of breaking existing workflows.(CVE-2020-15778)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"openssh","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/openssh&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.2p1-14.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["openssh-cavs-8.2p1-14.oe1.aarch64.rpm","openssh-debugsource-8.2p1-14.oe1.aarch64.rpm","openssh-server-8.2p1-14.oe1.aarch64.rpm","openssh-askpass-8.2p1-14.oe1.aarch64.rpm","pam_ssh_agent_auth-0.10.3-9.14.oe1.aarch64.rpm","openssh-clients-8.2p1-14.oe1.aarch64.rpm","openssh-8.2p1-14.oe1.aarch64.rpm","openssh-ldap-8.2p1-14.oe1.aarch64.rpm","openssh-debuginfo-8.2p1-14.oe1.aarch64.rpm","openssh-keycat-8.2p1-14.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["openssh-help-8.2p1-14.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["openssh-8.2p1-14.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["openssh-askpass-8.2p1-14.oe1.x86_64.rpm","openssh-debugsource-8.2p1-14.oe1.x86_64.rpm","openssh-clients-8.2p1-14.oe1.x86_64.rpm","openssh-server-8.2p1-14.oe1.x86_64.rpm","openssh-debuginfo-8.2p1-14.oe1.x86_64.rpm","openssh-ldap-8.2p1-14.oe1.x86_64.rpm","pam_ssh_agent_auth-0.10.3-9.14.oe1.x86_64.rpm","openssh-keycat-8.2p1-14.oe1.x86_64.rpm","openssh-cavs-8.2p1-14.oe1.x86_64.rpm","openssh-8.2p1-14.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1377.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openssh","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/openssh&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.2p1-14.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["openssh-debuginfo-8.2p1-14.oe1.aarch64.rpm","openssh-askpass-8.2p1-14.oe1.aarch64.rpm","openssh-debugsource-8.2p1-14.oe1.aarch64.rpm","openssh-8.2p1-14.oe1.aarch64.rpm","pam_ssh_agent_auth-0.10.3-9.14.oe1.aarch64.rpm","openssh-ldap-8.2p1-14.oe1.aarch64.rpm","openssh-cavs-8.2p1-14.oe1.aarch64.rpm","openssh-keycat-8.2p1-14.oe1.aarch64.rpm","openssh-clients-8.2p1-14.oe1.aarch64.rpm","openssh-server-8.2p1-14.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["openssh-help-8.2p1-14.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["openssh-8.2p1-14.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["openssh-debuginfo-8.2p1-14.oe1.x86_64.rpm","openssh-8.2p1-14.oe1.x86_64.rpm","openssh-keycat-8.2p1-14.oe1.x86_64.rpm","openssh-ldap-8.2p1-14.oe1.x86_64.rpm","openssh-server-8.2p1-14.oe1.x86_64.rpm","openssh-askpass-8.2p1-14.oe1.x86_64.rpm","openssh-clients-8.2p1-14.oe1.x86_64.rpm","openssh-cavs-8.2p1-14.oe1.x86_64.rpm","pam_ssh_agent_auth-0.10.3-9.14.oe1.x86_64.rpm","openssh-debugsource-8.2p1-14.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1377.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1377"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41617"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15778"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
