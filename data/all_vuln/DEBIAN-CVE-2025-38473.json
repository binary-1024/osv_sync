[0]  l2cap_sock_resume_cb() has a similar problem that was fixed by commit 1bff51ea59a9 (\"Bluetooth: fix use-after-free error in lock_sock_nested()\").  Since both l2cap_sock_kill() and l2cap_sock_resume_cb() are executed under l2cap_sock_resume_cb(), we can avoid the issue simply by checking if chan->data is NULL.  Let's not access to the killed socket in l2cap_sock_resume_cb().
