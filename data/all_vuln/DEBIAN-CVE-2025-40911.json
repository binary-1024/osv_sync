Leading zeros are used to indicate octal numbers, which can confuse users who are intentionally using octal notation, as well as users who believe they are using decimal notation.  Net::CIDR::Set used code from Net::CIDR::Lite, which had a similar vulnerability CVE-2021-47154.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libnet-cidr-set-perl","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libnet-cidr-set-perl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.13-3","0.13-4","0.13-5","0.15-1","0.19-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-40911.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libnet-cidr-set-perl","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libnet-cidr-set-perl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.13-4","0.13-5","0.15-1","0.19-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-40911.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libnet-cidr-set-perl","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libnet-cidr-set-perl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.15-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-40911.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libnet-cidr-set-perl","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libnet-cidr-set-perl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.15-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-40911.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-40911"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
