There were problems with connecting to a switch tree as a whole, so this got reworked to connecting to individual switches within the tree. In this process, tag_ops->disconnect(ds) was made to be called only from switch.c (cross-chip notifiers emitted as a result of dynamic tag proto changes), but the normal driver teardown code path wasn't replaced with anything.  Solve this problem by adding a function that does the opposite of dsa_switch_setup_tag_protocol(), which is called from the equivalent spot in dsa_switch_teardown(). The positioning here also ensures that we won't have any use-after-free in tagging protocol (*rcv) ops, since the teardown sequence is as follows:  dsa_tree_teardown -> dsa_tree_teardown_master    -> dsa_master_teardown       -> unsets master->dsa_ptr, making no further packets match the          ETH_P_XDSA packet type handler -> dsa_tree_teardown_ports    -> dsa_port_teardown       -> dsa_slave_destroy          -> unregisters DSA net devices, there is even a synchronize_net()             in unregister_netdevice_many() -> dsa_tree_teardown_switches    -> dsa_switch_teardown       -> dsa_switch_teardown_tag_protocol          -> finally frees the tagger-owned storage","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49808.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49808.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.10-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-49808.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-49808"}]}
