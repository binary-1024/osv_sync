There is an open redirect in the `@keystone-6/auth` package versions 7.0.0 and prior, where the redirect leading `/` filter can be bypassed. Users may be redirected to domains other than the relative host, thereby it might be used by attackers to re-direct users to an unexpected location. To mitigate this issue, one may apply a patch from pull request 8626 or avoid using the `@keystone-6/auth` package.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-34247.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/8626"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/security/advisories/GHSA-jqxr-vjvv-899m"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-601"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
