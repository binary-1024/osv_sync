{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-38311","published":"2025-07-10T08:15:30Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:20:39.529316Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-38311"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iavf: get rid of the crit lock  Get rid of the crit lock. That frees us from the error prone logic of try_locks.  Thanks to netdev_lock() by Jakub it is now easy, and in most cases we were protected by it already - replace crit lock by netdev lock when it was not the case.  Lockdep reports that we should cancel the work under crit_lock [splat1], and that was the scheme we have mostly followed since [1] by Slawomir. But when that is done we still got into deadlocks [splat2]. So instead we should look at the bigger problem, namely \"weird locking/scheduling\" of the iavf. The first step to fix that is to remove the crit lock. I will followup with a -next series that simplifies scheduling/tasks.  Cancel the work without netdev lock (weird unlock+lock scheme), to fix the [splat2] (which would be totally ugly if we would kept the crit lock).  Extend protected part of iavf_watchdog_task() to include scheduling more work.  Note that the removed comment in iavf_reset_task() was misplaced, it belonged to inside of the removed if condition, so it's gone now.
