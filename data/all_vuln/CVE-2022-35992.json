When `TensorListFromTensor` receives an `element_shape` of a rank greater than one, it gives a `CHECK` fail that can trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 3db59a042a38f4338aa207922fa2f476e000a6ee. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3db59a042a38f4338aa207922fa2f476e000a6ee"}]}],"versions":["0.12.0-rc0","0.12.0-rc1","0.12.1","0.5.0","0.6.0","v0.10.0","v0.10.0rc0","v0.11.0","v0.11.0rc0","v0.11.0rc1","v0.11.0rc2","v0.12.0","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.8.0rc0","v0.9.0","v0.9.0rc0","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-alpha","v1.0.0-rc0","v1.0.0-rc1","v1.0.0-rc2","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-rc0","v1.1.0-rc1","v1.1.0-rc2","v1.12.0","v1.12.0-rc0","v1.12.0-rc1","v1.12.0-rc2","v1.12.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-rc0","v1.2.0-rc1","v1.2.0-rc2","v1.3.0-rc0","v1.3.0-rc1","v1.5.0","v1.5.0-rc0","v1.5.0-rc1","v1.6.0","v1.6.0-rc0","v1.6.0-rc1","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-rc0","v1.7.0-rc1","v1.8.0","v1.8.0-rc0","v1.8.0-rc1","v1.9.0","v1.9.0-rc0","v1.9.0-rc1","v1.9.0-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-35992.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["43459218753324849153719412516594196934","106811845599598063433070956040502045309","165129771490868830844817057959729263103","204791509341067861682850292079140718472"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2022-35992-5bcf58c1","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3db59a042a38f4338aa207922fa2f476e000a6ee","target":{"file":"tensorflow/core/kernels/list_kernels.h"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/35xxx/CVE-2022-35992.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3db59a042a38f4338aa207922fa2f476e000a6ee"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-9v8w-xmr4-wgxp"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35992"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-617"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/35xxx/CVE-2022-35992.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
