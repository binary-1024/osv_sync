An attacker could cause `move_desc` to get stuck in a 4,294,967,295-count iteration loop. Depending on how `vhost_crypto` is being used this could prevent other VMs or network tasks from being serviced by the busy DPDK lcore for an extended period.","references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00004.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00006.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/04/1"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/04/2"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/04/5"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1879473"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4550-1/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/09/28/3"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
