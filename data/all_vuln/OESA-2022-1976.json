  "details": "MuJS is a lightweight Javascript interpreter designed for embedding in other software to extend them with scripting capabilities.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nIn Artifex MuJS through 1.2.0, jsP_dumpsyntax in jsdump.c has a NULL pointer dereference, as demonstrated by mujs-pp.(CVE-2022-30975)\r\n\r\ncompile in regexp.c in Artifex MuJS through 1.2.0 results in stack consumption because of unlimited recursion, a different issue than CVE-2019-11413.(CVE-2022-30974)\r\n\r\nA use-after-free vulnerability was observed in Rp_toString function of Artifex Software, Inc. MuJS before 5c337af4b3df80cf967e4f9f6a21522de84b392a. A successful exploitation of this issue can lead to code execution or denial of service condition.(CVE-2016-7504)\r\n\r\nInteger overflow in the js_regcomp function in regexp.c in Artifex Software, Inc. MuJS before commit b6de34ac6d8bb7dd5461c57940acfbd3ee7fd93e allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted regular expression.(CVE-2016-9108)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Artifex Software, Inc. MuJS before 4006739a28367c708dea19aeb19b8a1a9326ce08. The jsR_setproperty function in jsrun.c lacks a check for a negative array length. This leads to an integer overflow in the js_pushstring function in jsrun.c when parsing a specially crafted JS file.(CVE-2017-5627)\r\n\r\nAn out-of-bounds read vulnerability was observed in Sp_replace_regexp function of Artifex Software, Inc. MuJS before 5000749f5afe3b956fc916e407309de840997f4a. A successful exploitation of this issue can lead to code execution or denial of service condition.(CVE-2016-7506)\r\n\r\nArtifex Software, Inc. MuJS before a5c747f1d40e8d6659a37a8d25f13fb5acf8e767 allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information by using the &quot;opname in crafted JavaScript file&quot; approach, related to an &quot;Out-of-Bounds read&quot; issue affecting the jsC_dumpfunction function in the jsdump.c component.(CVE-2016-9017)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Artifex Software, Inc. MuJS before 8f62ea10a0af68e56d5c00720523ebcba13c2e6a. The MakeDay function in jsdate.c does not validate the month, leading to an integer overflow when parsing a specially crafted JS file.(CVE-2017-5628)\r\n\r\nAn integer overflow vulnerability was observed in the regemit function in regexp.c in Artifex Software, Inc. MuJS before fa3d30fd18c348bb4b1f3858fb860f4fcd4b2045. The attack requires a regular expression with nested repetition. A successful exploitation of this issue can lead to code execution or a denial of service (buffer overflow) condition.(CVE-2016-10141)\r\n\r\nArtifex Software, Inc. MuJS before a0ceaf5050faf419401fe1b83acfa950ec8a8a89 allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information by using the &quot;crafted JavaScript&quot; approach, related to a &quot;Buffer Over-read&quot; issue.(CVE-2016-9136)",
