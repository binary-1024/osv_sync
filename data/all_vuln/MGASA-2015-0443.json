  "details": "An unauthorized privilege escalation was found in sudoedit in sudo before\n1.8.15 when a user is granted with root access to modify a particular file\nthat could be located in a subset of directories. It seems that sudoedit\ndoes not check the full path if a wildcard is used twice\n(e.g. /home/*/*/file.txt), allowing a malicious user to replace the\nfile.txt real file with a symbolic link to a different location\n(e.g. /etc/shadow), which results in unauthorized access (CVE-2015-5602).\n\nThe sudo package has been updated to version 1.8.15, which fixes this\nissue, and also includes many other bug fixes and changes.  See the\nupstream change log for details.\n",
