On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this\nresults in a denial of service when the affected process hangs.  Policy\nprocessing being enabled on a publicly facing server is not considered\nto be a common setup.\n\nPolicy processing is enabled by passing the `-policy'\nargument to the command line utilities
