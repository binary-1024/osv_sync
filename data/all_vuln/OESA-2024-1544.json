These libraries provide critical APIs including ISO C11, POSIX.1-2008, BSD, OS-specific APIs and more. These APIs include such foundational facilities as open, read, write, malloc, printf, getaddrinfo, dlopen, pthread_create, crypt,  login, exit and more.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nnscd: Stack-based buffer overflow in netgroup cache\r\n\r\nIf the Name Service Cache Daemon&apos;s (nscd) fixed size cache is exhausted\nby client requests then a subsequent client request for netgroup data\nmay result in a stack-based buffer overflow.  This flaw was introduced\nin glibc 2.15 when the cache was added to nscd.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is only present in the nscd binary.\n(CVE-2024-33599)\r\n\r\nnscd: Null pointer crashes after notfound response\r\n\r\nIf the Name Service Cache Daemon&apos;s (nscd) cache fails to add a not-found\nnetgroup response to the cache, the client request can result in a null\npointer dereference.
