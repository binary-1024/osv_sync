{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-71080","published":"2026-01-13T15:34:44.832Z","modified":"2026-01-13T20:10:01.236857Z","summary":"ipv6: fix a BUG in rt6_get_pcpu_route() under PREEMPT_RT","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv6: fix a BUG in rt6_get_pcpu_route() under PREEMPT_RT\n\nOn PREEMPT_RT kernels, after rt6_get_pcpu_route() returns NULL, the\ncurrent task can be preempted. Another task running on the same CPU\nmay then execute rt6_make_pcpu_route() and successfully install a\npcpu_rt entry. When the first task resumes execution, its cmpxchg()\nin rt6_make_pcpu_route() will fail because rt6i_pcpu is no longer\nNULL, triggering the BUG_ON(prev). It's easy to reproduce it by adding\nmdelay() after rt6_get_pcpu_route().\n\nUsing preempt_disable/enable is not appropriate here because\nip6_rt_pcpu_alloc() may sleep.\n\nFix this by handling the cmpxchg() failure gracefully on PREEMPT_RT:\nfree our allocation and return the existing pcpu_rt installed by\nanother task. The BUG_ON is replaced by WARN_ON_ONCE for non-PREEMPT_RT\nkernels where such races should not occur.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"d2d6422f8bd17c6bb205133e290625a564194496"},{"fixed":"1dc33ad0867325f8d2c6d7b2a6f542d4f3121f66"},{"fixed":"787515ccb2292f82eb0876993129154629a49651"},{"fixed":"1adaea51c61b52e24e7ab38f7d3eba023b2d050d"}]}],"versions":["v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.46","v6.12.47","v6.12.48","v6.12.49","v6.12.5","v6.12.50","v6.12.51","v6.12.52","v6.12.53","v6.12.54","v6.12.55","v6.12.56","v6.12.57","v6.12.58","v6.12.59","v6.12.6","v6.12.60","v6.12.61","v6.12.62","v6.12.63","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.18","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5","v6.18-rc6","v6.18-rc7","v6.18.1","v6.18.2","v6.18.3","v6.19-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-71080.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.12.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.64"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.18.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-71080.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1adaea51c61b52e24e7ab38f7d3eba023b2d050d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1dc33ad0867325f8d2c6d7b2a6f542d4f3121f66"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/787515ccb2292f82eb0876993129154629a49651"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/71xxx/CVE-2025-71080.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-71080"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/71xxx/CVE-2025-71080.json"}}
