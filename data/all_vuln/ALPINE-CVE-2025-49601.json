{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2025-49601","published":"2025-07-04T15:15:22Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:30:14.099867Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-49601"],"details":"In MbedTLS 3.3.0 before 3.6.4, mbedtls_lms_import_public_key does not check that the input buffer is at least 4 bytes before reading a 32-bit field, allowing a possible out-of-bounds read on truncated input. Specifically, an out-of-bounds read in mbedtls_lms_import_public_key allows context-dependent attackers to trigger a crash or limited adjacent-memory disclosure by supplying a truncated LMS (Leighton-Micali Signature) public-key buffer under four bytes. An LMS public key starts with a 4-byte type indicator. The function mbedtls_lms_import_public_key reads this type indicator before validating the size of its input.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.10-r0","2.16.10-r1","2.16.12-r0","2.16.12-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.16.6-r0","2.16.8-r0","2.16.9-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.1-r0","2.28.1-r1","2.28.2-r0","2.28.3-r0","2.28.3-r1","2.28.3-r2","2.28.3-r3","2.28.4-r0","2.28.5-r0","2.28.6-r0","2.28.7-r0","2.28.8-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.2-r0","3.6.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-49601.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.10-r0","2.16.10-r1","2.16.12-r0","2.16.12-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.16.6-r0","2.16.8-r0","2.16.9-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.1-r0","2.28.1-r1","2.28.2-r0","2.28.3-r0","2.28.3-r1","2.28.3-r2","2.28.3-r3","2.28.4-r0","2.28.5-r0","2.28.6-r0","2.28.7-r0","2.28.8-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.2-r0","3.6.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-49601.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.10-r0","2.16.10-r1","2.16.12-r0","2.16.12-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.16.6-r0","2.16.8-r0","2.16.9-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.1-r0","2.28.1-r1","2.28.2-r0","2.28.3-r0","2.28.3-r1","2.28.3-r2","2.28.3-r3","2.28.4-r0","2.28.5-r0","2.28.6-r0","2.28.7-r0","2.28.8-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.2-r0","3.6.3-r0","3.6.3.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-49601.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2025-49601"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L"}]}
