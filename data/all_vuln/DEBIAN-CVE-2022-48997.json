Specifically, the hw_random tpm driver makes use of tpm_get_random(), and this function is called in a loop from a kthread, which means it's not frozen alongside userspace, and so can race with the work done during system suspend:    tpm tpm0: tpm_transmit: tpm_recv: error -52   tpm tpm0: invalid TPM_STS.x 0xff, dumping stack for forensics   CPU: 0 PID: 1 Comm: init Not tainted 6.1.0-rc5+ #135   Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.16.0-20220807_005459-localhost 04/01/2014   Call Trace:    tpm_tis_status.cold+0x19/0x20    tpm_transmit+0x13b/0x390    tpm_transmit_cmd+0x20/0x80    tpm1_pm_suspend+0xa6/0x110    tpm_pm_suspend+0x53/0x80    __pnp_bus_suspend+0x35/0xe0    __device_suspend+0x10f/0x350  Fix this by calling tpm_try_get_ops(), which itself is a wrapper around tpm_chip_start(), but takes the appropriate mutex.
