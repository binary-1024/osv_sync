{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-22218","published":"2026-01-20T00:15:48.910Z","modified":"2026-01-21T06:51:27.768331Z","details":"Chainlit versions prior to 2.9.4 contain an arbitrary file read vulnerability in the /project/element update flow. An authenticated client can send a custom Element with a user-controlled path value, causing the server to copy the referenced file into the attacker’s session. The resulting element identifier (chainlitKey) can then be used to retrieve the file contents via /project/file/<chainlitKey>, allowing disclosure of any file readable by the Chainlit service.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/chainlit/chainlit","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ffc3cce648b343b933e10e85ee5805c7e02ab3bf"}]}],"versions":["0.1.1","0.1.101","0.1.102","0.1.103","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.2.101","0.2.102","0.2.103","0.2.104","0.2.105","0.2.106","0.2.107","0.2.108","0.2.109","0.2.110","0.2.111","0.3.0","0.4.0","0.4.1","0.4.101","0.4.2","0.4.3","0.5.0","0.5.1","0.5.2","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.6.2","0.6.3","0.6.4","0.6.401","0.6.402","0.7.0","0.7.1","0.7.2","0.7.3","0.7.301","0.7.400","0.7.500","0.7.501","0.7.600rc0","0.7.600rc1","0.7.601rc0","0.7.602","0.7.602rc0","0.7.603","0.7.604","0.7.604rc0","0.7.604rc1","0.7.604rc2","0.7.700","1.0.0","1.0.0rc0","1.0.0rc1","1.0.0rc2","1.0.0rc3","1.0.100","1.0.101","1.0.200","1.0.300","1.0.301","1.0.400","1.0.401","1.0.500","1.0.501","1.0.502","1.0.503","1.0.504","1.0.505","1.0.506","1.1.0","1.1.0rc0","1.1.0rc1","1.1.101","1.1.200","1.1.201","1.1.202","1.1.300","1.1.300rc0","1.1.300rc1","1.1.300rc2","1.1.300rc3","1.1.300rc4","1.1.300rc5","1.1.301","1.1.302","1.1.303","1.1.304","1.1.305","1.1.306","1.1.306-fix","1.1.400","1.1.400rc0","1.1.400rc1","1.1.401","1.1.402","1.1.403rc0","1.1.404","1.2.0","1.3.0rc0","2.0.0","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.0.6","2.0.601","2.0.602","2.0.603","2.0.dev0","2.0.dev2","2.0dev1","2.0rc1","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.2","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.3.0","2.4.0","2.4.0rc0","2.4.1","2.4.2","2.4.201","2.4.3","2.4.301","2.4.302","2.4.400","2.5.5","2.6.0","2.6.1","2.6.2","2.6.3","2.6.4","2.6.5","2.6.6","2.6.7","2.6.8","2.6.9","2.7.0","2.7.1","2.7.1.1","2.7.2","2.8.0","2.8.1","2.8.2","2.8.3","2.8.4","2.8.5","2.9.0","2.9.1","2.9.2","2.9.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22218.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit/releases/tag/2.9.4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/chainlit-arbitrary-file-read-via-project-element"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
