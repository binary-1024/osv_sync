{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68810","published":"2026-01-13T15:29:16.475Z","modified":"2026-01-13T20:01:18.644759Z","summary":"KVM: Disallow toggling KVM_MEM_GUEST_MEMFD on an existing memslot","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: Disallow toggling KVM_MEM_GUEST_MEMFD on an existing memslot\n\nReject attempts to disable KVM_MEM_GUEST_MEMFD on a memslot that was\ninitially created with a guest_memfd binding, as KVM doesn't support\ntoggling KVM_MEM_GUEST_MEMFD on existing memslots.  KVM prevents enabling\nKVM_MEM_GUEST_MEMFD, but doesn't prevent clearing the flag.\n\nFailure to reject the new memslot results in a use-after-free due to KVM\nnot unbinding from the guest_memfd instance.  Unbinding on a FLAGS_ONLY\nchange is easy enough, and can/will be done as a hardening measure (in\nanticipation of KVM supporting dirty logging on guest_memfd at some point),\nbut fixing the use-after-free would only address the immediate symptom.\n\n  ==================================================================\n  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in kvm_gmem_release+0x362/0x400
