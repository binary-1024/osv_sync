When the deferred request is revisited, the pointer is copied into the new svc_rqst - and also remains in the svc_deferred_req.  In the (rare?) case that the request is deferred a second time, the old svc_deferred_req is reused - it still has all the correct content. However in that case the rq_xprt_ctxt pointer is NOT cleared so that when xpo_release_xprt is called, the ctxt is freed (UDP) or possible added to a free list (RDMA). When the deferred request is revisited for a second time, it will reference this ctxt which may be invalid, and the free the object a second time which is likely to oops.  So change svc_defer() to *always* clear rq_xprt_ctxt, and assert that the value is now stored in the svc_deferred_req.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.37-1"}]}],"versions":["6.1.27-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-54269.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.3.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-54269.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.3.7-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-54269.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-54269"}]}
