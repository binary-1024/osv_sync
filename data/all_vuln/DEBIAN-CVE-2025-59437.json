NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2024-29415. NOTE: in current versions of several applications, connection attempts to the IP address 0 (interpreted as 0.0.0.0) are blocked with error messages such as net::ERR_ADDRESS_INVALID. However, in some situations that depend on both application version and operating system, connection attempts to 0 and 0.0.0.0 are considered connection attempts to 127.0.0.1 (and, for this reason, a false value of isPublic would be preferable).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"node-ip","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-ip?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.1+~1.1.3-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-59437.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-ip","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-ip?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.1+~1.1.3-3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-59437.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-59437"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
