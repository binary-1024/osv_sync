It requires the attacker to send a large number of messages for decryption, as described in \"Everlasting ROBOT: the Marvin Attack\" by Hubert Kario.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"MbedTLS_jll","ecosystem":"Julia","purl":"pkg:julia/MbedTLS_jll?uuid=c8ffd9c3-330d-5841-b78e-0817d7145fa1"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.28.10+0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/SecurityAdvisories.jl/tree/generated/osv/2025/JLSEC-2025-223.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GP5UU7Z6LJNBLBT4SC5WWS2HDNMTFZH5/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IIBPEYSVRK4IFLBSYJAWKH33YBNH5HR2/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://mbed-tls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-advisories/mbedtls-security-advisory-2024-01-1/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GP5UU7Z6LJNBLBT4SC5WWS2HDNMTFZH5/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IIBPEYSVRK4IFLBSYJAWKH33YBNH5HR2/"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC-BY-4.0","sources":[{"html_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23170","id":"CVE-2024-23170","imported":"2025-11-20T23:04:02.691Z","modified":"2025-11-04T19:16:33.367Z","published":"2024-01-31T08:15:42.220Z","url":"https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2024-23170"}]}}
