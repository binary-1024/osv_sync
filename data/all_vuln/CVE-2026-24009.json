{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-24009","published":"2026-01-22T15:04:52.745Z","modified":"2026-01-28T05:33:43.397470Z","aliases":["GHSA-vqxf-v2gg-x3hc"],"related":["GHSA-8q59-q68h-6hv4","GHSA-vqxf-v2gg-x3hc"],"summary":"Docling Core vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via unsafe PyYAML usage","details":"Docling Core (or docling-core) is a library that defines core data types and transformations in the document processing application Docling. A PyYAML-related Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability, namely CVE-2020-14343, is exposed in docling-core starting in version 2.21.0 and prior to version 2.48.4, specifically only if the application uses pyyaml prior to version 5.4 and invokes `docling_core.types.doc.DoclingDocument.load_from_yaml()` passing it untrusted YAML data. The vulnerability has been patched in docling-core version 2.48.4. The fix mitigates the issue by switching `PyYAML` deserialization from `yaml.FullLoader` to `yaml.SafeLoader`, ensuring that untrusted data cannot trigger code execution. Users who cannot immediately upgrade docling-core can alternatively ensure that the installed version of PyYAML is 5.4 or greater.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/docling-project/docling-core","events":[{"introduced":"b2c974696cf7b15037932b6d62724404823712f9"},{"fixed":"c52605dded70787e647a100a30c85a05c4e989a9"}]}],"versions":["v2.21.0","v2.21.1","v2.21.2","v2.22.0","v2.23.0","v2.23.1","v2.23.2","v2.23.3","v2.24.0","v2.24.1","v2.25.0","v2.26.0","v2.26.1","v2.26.2","v2.26.3","v2.26.4","v2.27.0","v2.28.0","v2.28.1","v2.29.0","v2.30.0","v2.30.1","v2.31.0","v2.31.1","v2.31.2","v2.32.0","v2.33.0","v2.33.1","v2.34.0","v2.34.1","v2.34.2","v2.35.0","v2.36.0","v2.37.0","v2.38.0","v2.38.1","v2.38.2","v2.39.0","v2.40.0","v2.41.0","v2.42.0","v2.43.0","v2.43.1","v2.44.0","v2.44.1","v2.44.2","v2.45.0","v2.46.0","v2.47.0","v2.48.0","v2.48.1","v2.48.2","v2.48.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24009.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24009.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8q59-q68h-6hv4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/docling-project/docling-core/commit/3e8d628eeeae50f0f8f239c8c7fea773d065d80c"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/docling-project/docling-core/issues/482"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/docling-project/docling-core/releases/tag/v2.48.4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/docling-project/docling-core/security/advisories/GHSA-vqxf-v2gg-x3hc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24009"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-502"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24009.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
