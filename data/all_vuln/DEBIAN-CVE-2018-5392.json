ASLR is an exploit mitigation technique used by modern Windows platforms. For ASLR to function, Windows executables must contain a relocations table. Despite containing the \"Dynamic base\" PE header, which indicates ASLR compatibility, Windows executables produced by mingw-w64 have the relocations table stripped from them by default. This means that executables produced by mingw-w64 are vulnerable to return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks. Windows executables generated by mingw-w64 claim to be ASLR compatible, but are not. Vulnerabilities in such executables are more easily exploitable as a result.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mingw-w64","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/mingw-w64?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["10.0.0-1","10.0.0-2","10.0.0-3","11.0.0-1","11.0.1-1","11.0.1-2","11.0.1-3","11.0.1-4","12.0.0-1","12.0.0-2","12.0.0-3","12.0.0-4","12.0.0-4~exp1","12.0.0-4~exp2","12.0.0-4~exp3","12.0.0-4~exp4","12.0.0-5","13.0.0-1","8.0.0-1","9.0.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-5392.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mingw-w64","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/mingw-w64?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["10.0.0-3","11.0.0-1","11.0.1-1","11.0.1-2","11.0.1-3","11.0.1-4","12.0.0-1","12.0.0-2","12.0.0-3","12.0.0-4","12.0.0-4~exp1","12.0.0-4~exp2","12.0.0-4~exp3","12.0.0-4~exp4","12.0.0-5","13.0.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-5392.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mingw-w64","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/mingw-w64?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["12.0.0-5","13.0.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-5392.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mingw-w64","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/mingw-w64?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["12.0.0-5","13.0.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2018-5392.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5392"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
