  "details": "This libtiff provides support for the Tag Image File Format (TIFF), a widely used format for storing image data. The latest version of the TIFF specification is available on-line in several different formats.And contains command-line programs for manipulating TIFF format image files using the libtiff library.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA flaw was found in libtiff. Due to a memory allocation failure in tif_read.c, a crafted TIFF file can lead to an abort, resulting in denial of service.(CVE-2020-35521)\n\nIn LibTIFF, there is a memory malloc failure in tif_pixarlog.c. A crafted TIFF document can lead to an abort, resulting in a remote denial of service attack.(CVE-2020-35522)\r\n\r\nAn integer overflow flaw was found in libtiff that exists in the tif_getimage.c file. This flaw allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code when a user opens a crafted TIFF file. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-35523)\r\n\r\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in libtiff in the handling of TIFF images in libtiff&apos;s TIFF2PDF tool. A specially crafted TIFF file can lead to arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-35524)",
