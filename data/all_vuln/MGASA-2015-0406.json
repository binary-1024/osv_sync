  "details": "An integer overflow, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow flaw was\nfound in the way FuseISO, a FUSE module to mount ISO filesystem images,\nperformed reading of certain ZF blocks of particular inodes. A remote\nattacker could provide a specially-crafted ISO file that, when mounted via\nthe fuseiso tool would lead to fuseiso binary crash.\n\nA stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way FuseISO, a FUSE\nmodule to mount ISO filesystem images, performed expanding of directory\nportions for absolute path filename entries. A remote attacker could\nprovide a specially-crafted ISO file that, when mounted via fuseiso tool\nwould lead to fuseiso binary crash or, potentially, arbitrary code\nexecution with the privileges of the user running the fuseiso executable.\nThis issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security\nTeam. The issue got resolved by checking the resulting length of an\nabsolute path name and by bailing out if the platform's PATH_MAX value\ngets exceeded.\n",
