The problem can be reproduced by the following steps:   1. Allocate an anonymous 1GB HugeTLB and some other anonymous memory.  2. Swapout the above anonymous memory.  3. run swapoff and we will get a bad pud error in kernel message:    mm/pgtable-generic.c:42: bad pud 00000000743d215d(84000001400000e7)  We can tell that pud_clear_bad is called by pud_none_or_clear_bad in unuse_pud_range() by ftrace.  And therefore the HugeTLB pages will never be freed because we lost it from page table.  We can skip HugeTLB pages for unuse_vma to fix it.(CVE-2024-50199)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  posix-clock: posix-clock: Fix unbalanced locking in pc_clock_settime()  If get_clock_desc() succeeds, it calls fget() for the clockid&apos;s fd, and get the clk-&gt;rwsem read lock, so the error path should release the lock to make the lock balance and fput the clockid&apos;s fd to make the refcount balance and release the fd related resource.  However the below commit left the error path locked behind resulting in unbalanced locking. Check timespec64_valid_strict() before get_clock_desc() to fix it, because the &quot;ts&quot; is not changed after that.  [pabeni@redhat.com: fixed commit message typo](CVE-2024-50210)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  USB: serial: io_edgeport: fix use after free in debug printk  The &quot;dev_dbg(&amp;urb-&gt;dev-&gt;dev, ...&quot; which happens after usb_free_urb(urb) is a use after free of the &quot;urb&quot; pointer.  Store the &quot;dev&quot; pointer at the start of the function to avoid this issue.(CVE-2024-50267)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dm cache: fix potential out-of-bounds access on the first resume  Out-of-bounds access occurs if the fast device is expanded unexpectedly before the first-time resume of the cache table. This happens because expanding the fast device requires reloading the cache table for cache_create to allocate new in-core data structures that fit the new size, and the check in cache_preresume is not performed during the first resume, leading to the issue.  Reproduce steps:  1. prepare component devices:  dmsetup create cmeta --table &quot;0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0&quot; dmsetup create cdata --table &quot;0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192&quot; dmsetup create corig --table &quot;0 524288 linear /dev/sdc 262144&quot; dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1 oflag=direct  2. load a cache table of 512 cache blocks, and deliberately expand the    fast device before resuming the cache, making the in-core data    structures inadequate.  dmsetup create cache --notable dmsetup reload cache --table &quot;0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \\ /dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0&quot; dmsetup reload cdata --table &quot;0 131072 linear /dev/sdc 8192&quot; dmsetup resume cdata dmsetup resume cache  3. suspend the cache to write out the in-core dirty bitset and hint    array, leading to out-of-bounds access to the dirty bitset at offset    0x40:  dmsetup suspend cache  KASAN reports:    BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in is_dirty_callback+0x2b/0x80   Read of size 8 at addr ffffc90000085040 by task dmsetup/90    (...snip...)

If this ever happens, this will cause a division by zero.  Instead, add a WARN_ON_ONCE() to trigger such cases and return without doing any precalculation.(CVE-2024-50287)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: core: zero-initialize the report buffer  Since the report buffer is used by all kinds of drivers in various ways, let&apos;s zero-initialize it during allocation to make sure that it can&apos;t be ever used to leak kernel memory via specially-crafted report.(CVE-2024-50302)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: uvcvideo: Skip parsing frames of type UVC_VS_UNDEFINED in uvc_parse_format  This can lead to out of bounds writes since frames of this type were not taken into account when calculating the size of the frames buffer in uvc_parse_streaming.(CVE-2024-53104)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kernel","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP4","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/kernel&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP4"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["bpftool-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["kernel-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["bpftool-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2412.2.0.0307.oe2003sp4.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2024-2535.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2024-2535"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50150"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50199"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50210"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50267"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50278"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50287"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50302"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53104"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
