It provides an NSS and PAM interface toward the system and a pluggable backend system to connect to multiple different account sources.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA flaw was found in the integration of Active Directory and the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) on Linux systems. In default configurations, SSSD does not enable the Kerberos local authentication plugin (sssd_krb5_localauth_plugin), allowing an attacker with permission to modify certain AD attributes (such as userPrincipalName or samAccountName) to impersonate privileged users. This can result in unauthorized access or privilege escalation on domain-joined Linux hosts.(CVE-2025-11561)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"sssd","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/sssd&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libipa_hbac-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","libipa_hbac-devel-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","libsss_autofs-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","libsss_certmap-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","libsss_certmap-devel-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","libsss_idmap-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","libsss_idmap-devel-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","libsss_nss_idmap-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","libsss_nss_idmap-devel-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","libsss_sudo-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","python3-libipa_hbac-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","python3-libsss_nss_idmap-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","python3-sss-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","python3-sss-murmur-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","sssd-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","sssd-ad-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","sssd-client-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","sssd-common-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","sssd-common-pac-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","sssd-dbus-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","sssd-debuginfo-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","sssd-debugsource-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","sssd-idp-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","sssd-ipa-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","sssd-kcm-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","sssd-krb5-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","sssd-krb5-common-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","sssd-ldap-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","sssd-nfs-idmap-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","sssd-proxy-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","sssd-tools-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm","sssd-winbind-idmap-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["python3-sssdconfig-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.noarch.rpm","sssd-help-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.noarch.rpm"],"src":["sssd-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libipa_hbac-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","libipa_hbac-devel-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","libsss_autofs-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","libsss_certmap-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","libsss_certmap-devel-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","libsss_idmap-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","libsss_idmap-devel-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","libsss_nss_idmap-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","libsss_nss_idmap-devel-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","libsss_sudo-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","python3-libipa_hbac-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","python3-libsss_nss_idmap-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","python3-sss-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","python3-sss-murmur-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","sssd-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","sssd-ad-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","sssd-client-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","sssd-common-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","sssd-common-pac-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","sssd-dbus-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","sssd-debuginfo-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","sssd-debugsource-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","sssd-idp-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","sssd-ipa-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","sssd-kcm-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","sssd-krb5-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","sssd-krb5-common-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","sssd-ldap-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","sssd-nfs-idmap-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","sssd-proxy-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","sssd-tools-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm","sssd-winbind-idmap-2.9.4-15.oe2403sp2.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2579.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2579"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-11561"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
