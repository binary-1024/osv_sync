  "details": "There exists a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel through io_uring and the\u00a0IORING_OP_SPLICE operation. If\u00a0IORING_OP_SPLICE is\u00a0missing the IO_WQ_WORK_FILES flag, which signals that the operation won't use current->nsproxy, so its reference counter is not increased. This assumption is not always true as calling io_splice on specific files will call the get_uts function which will use current->nsproxy leading to invalidly decreasing its reference counter later causing the use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading to version 5.10.160 or above\n",
