  "details": "net/http: improper sanitization of Transfer-Encoding header\nThe HTTP/1 client accepted some invalid Transfer-Encoding headers as\nindicating a \"chunked\" encoding. This could potentially allow for request\nsmuggling, but only if combined with an intermediate server that also\nimproperly failed to reject the header as invalid. (CVE-2022-1705)\n\nWhen httputil.ReverseProxy.ServeHTTP was called with a Request.Header map\ncontaining a nil value for the X-Forwarded-For header, ReverseProxy would\nset the client IP as the value of the X-Forwarded-For header, contrary to\nits documentation. In the more usual case where a Director function set\nthe X-Forwarded-For header value to nil, ReverseProxy would leave the\nheader unmodified as expected. (CVE-2022-32148)\n\ncompress/gzip: stack exhaustion in Reader.Read\nCalling Reader.Read on an archive containing a large number of\nconcatenated 0-length compressed files can cause a panic due to stack\nexhaustion. (CVE-2022-30631)\n\nencoding/xml: stack exhaustion in Unmarshal\nCalling Unmarshal on a XML document into a Go struct which has a nested\nfield that uses the any field tag can cause a panic due to stack\nexhaustion. (CVE-2022-30633)\n\nencoding/xml: stack exhaustion in Decoder.Skip\nCalling Decoder.Skip when parsing a deeply nested XML document can cause a\npanic due to stack exhaustion. (CVE-2022-28131)\n\nencoding/gob: stack exhaustion in Decoder.Decode\nCalling Decoder.Decode on a message which contains deeply nested\nstructures can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion. (CVE-2022-30635)\n\npath/filepath: stack exhaustion in Glob\nCalling Glob on a path which contains a large number of path separators\ncan cause a panic due to stack exhaustion. (CVE-2022-30632)\n\nio/fs: stack exhaustion in Glob\nCalling Glob on a path which contains a large number of path separators\ncan cause a panic due to stack exhaustion. (CVE-2022-30630)\n\ngo/parser: stack exhaustion in all Parse* functions\nCalling any of the Parse functions on Go source code which contains deeply\nnested types or declarations can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.\n(CVE-2022-1962)\n",
