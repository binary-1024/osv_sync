This turned out to be because\nwe were not writing out dirty blocks sometimes, so this in fact affects\nall metadata writes.\n\nWhen writing out a subpage EB we scan the subpage bitmap for a dirty\nrange.  If the range isn&apos;t dirty we do\n\n\tbit_start++;\n\nto move onto the next bit.  The problem is the bitmap is based on the\nnumber of sectors that an EB has.  So in this case, we have a 64k\npagesize, 16k nodesize, but a 4k sectorsize.  This means our bitmap is 4\nbits for every node.  With a 64k page size we end up with 4 nodes per\npage.\n\nTo make this easier this is how everything looks\n\n[0         16k       32k       48k     ] logical address\n[0         4         8         12      ] radix tree offset\n[               64k page               ] folio\n[ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ] extent buffers\n[ | | | |  | | | |   | | | |   | | | | ] bitmap\n\nNow we use all of our addressing based on fs_info-&gt;sectorsize_bits, so\nas you can see the above our 16k eb-&gt;start turns into radix entry 4.\n\nWhen we find a dirty range for our eb, we correctly do bit_start +=\nsectors_per_node, because if we start at bit 0, the next bit for the\nnext eb is 4, to correspond to eb-&gt;start 16k.\n\nHowever if our range is clean, we will do bit_start++, which will now\nput us offset from our radix tree entries.\n\nIn our case, assume that the first time we check the bitmap the block is\nnot dirty, we increment bit_start so now it == 1, and then we loop\naround and check again.  This time it is dirty, and we go to find that\nstart using the following equation\n\n\tstart = folio_start + bit_start * fs_info-&gt;sectorsize;\n\nso in the case above, eb-&gt;start 0 is now dirty, and we calculate start\nas\n\n\t0 + 1 * fs_info-&gt;sectorsize = 4096\n\t4096 &gt;&gt; 12 = 1\n\nNow we&apos;re looking up the radix tree for 1, and we won&apos;t find an eb.\nWhat&apos;s worse is now we&apos;re using bit_start == 1, so we do bit_start +=\nsectors_per_node, which is now 5.  If that eb is dirty we will run into\nthe same thing, we will look at an offset that is not populated in the\nradix tree, and now we&apos;re skipping the writeout of dirty extent buffers.\n\nThe best fix for this is to not use sectorsize_bits to address nodes,\nbut that&apos;s a larger change.  Since this is a fs corruption problem fix\nit simply by always using sectors_per_node to increment the start bit.(CVE-2025-37931)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbus: fsl-mc: fix double-free on mc_dev\n\nThe blamed commit tried to simplify how the deallocations are done but,\nin the process, introduced a double-free on the mc_dev variable.\n\nIn case the MC device is a DPRC, a new mc_bus is allocated and the\nmc_dev variable is just a reference to one of its fields.

This causes a mismatch between\nthe block device block size and the block size stored in the superblock\ncausing confusion in various places such as fs/buffer.c. The particular\nissue triggered by syzbot was a warning in __getblk_slow() due to\nrequested buffer size not matching block device block size.\n\nFix the problem by getting exclusive hold of the loop device to change\nits block size. This fails if somebody (such as filesystem) has already\nan exclusive ownership of the block device and thus prevents modifying\nthe loop device under some exclusive owner which doesn&apos;t expect it.(CVE-2025-38709)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/buffer: fix use-after-free when call bh_read() helper\n\nThere&apos;s issue as follows:\nBUG: KASAN: stack-out-of-bounds in end_buffer_read_sync+0xe3/0x110\nRead of size 8 at addr ffffc9000168f7f8 by task swapper/3/0\nCPU: 3 UID: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/3 Not tainted 6.16.0-862.14.0.6.x86_64\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996)\nCall Trace:\n &lt;IRQ&gt;\n dump_stack_lvl+0x55/0x70\n print_address_description.constprop.0+0x2c/0x390\n print_report+0xb4/0x270\n kasan_report+0xb8/0xf0\n end_buffer_read_sync+0xe3/0x110\n end_bio_bh_io_sync+0x56/0x80\n blk_update_request+0x30a/0x720\n scsi_end_request+0x51/0x2b0\n scsi_io_completion+0xe3/0x480\n ? scsi_device_unbusy+0x11e/0x160\n blk_complete_reqs+0x7b/0x90\n handle_softirqs+0xef/0x370\n irq_exit_rcu+0xa5/0xd0\n sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt+0x6e/0x90\n &lt;/IRQ&gt;\n\n Above issue happens when do ntfs3 filesystem mount, issue may happens\n as follows:\n           mount                            IRQ\nntfs_fill_super\n  read_cache_page\n    do_read_cache_folio\n      filemap_read_folio\n        mpage_read_folio\n\t do_mpage_readpage\n\t  ntfs_get_block_vbo\n\t   bh_read\n\t     submit_bh\n\t     wait_on_buffer(bh);\n\t                            blk_complete_reqs\n\t\t\t\t     scsi_io_completion\n\t\t\t\t      scsi_end_request\n\t\t\t\t       blk_update_request\n\t\t\t\t        end_bio_bh_io_sync\n\t\t\t\t\t end_buffer_read_sync\n\t\t\t\t\t  __end_buffer_read_notouch\n\t\t\t\t\t   unlock_buffer\n\n            wait_on_buffer(bh);--&gt; return will return to caller\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  put_bh\n\t\t\t\t\t    --&gt; trigger stack-out-of-bounds\nIn the mpage_read_folio() function, the stack variable &apos;map_bh&apos; is\npassed to ntfs_get_block_vbo().

If kmalloc() fails in add_interval(), it could\nresult in a null pointer being inserted into the linked list,\nleading to illegal memory access when sub_interval() is called\nnext.\n\nThis patch adds an error handling for the add_interval(). If\nadd_interval() returns an error, the function will return early\nwith the error code.(CVE-2025-39920)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndmaengine: qcom: bam_dma: Fix DT error handling for num-channels/ees\n\nWhen we don&apos;t have a clock specified in the device tree, we have no way to\nensure the BAM is on. This is often the case for remotely-controlled or\nremotely-powered BAM instances. In this case, we need to read num-channels\nfrom the DT to have all the necessary information to complete probing.\n\nHowever, at the moment invalid device trees without clock and without\nnum-channels still continue probing, because the error handling is missing\nreturn statements. The driver will then later try to read the number of\nchannels from the registers. This is unsafe, because it relies on boot\nfirmware and lucky timing to succeed. Unfortunately, the lack of proper\nerror handling here has been abused for several Qualcomm SoCs upstream,\ncausing early boot crashes in several situations [1, 2].\n\nAvoid these early crashes by erroring out when any of the required DT\nproperties are missing. Note that this will break some of the existing DTs\nupstream (mainly BAM instances related to the crypto engine). However,\nclearly these DTs have never been tested properly, since the error in the\nkernel log was just ignored. It&apos;s safer to disable the crypto engine for\nthese broken DTBs.\n\n[1]: https://lore.kernel.org/r/(CVE-2025-39923)\n\nIn the Linux kernel i40e driver, there is a security vulnerability: the driver lacks boundary checks for the maximum number of virtual function (VF) filters.

What am I trying to do:\n\nThis patchset resolves two critical regressions related to memory failure\nhandling that have appeared in the upstream kernel since version 5.17, as\ncompared to 5.10 LTS.\n\n    - copyin case: poison found in user page while kernel copying from user space\n    - instr case: poison found while instruction fetching in user space\n\n## 2. What is the expected outcome and why\n\n- For copyin case:\n\nKernel can recover from poison found where kernel is doing get_user() or\ncopy_from_user() if those places get an error return and the kernel return\n-EFAULT to the process instead of crashing.  More specifily, MCE handler\nchecks the fixup handler type to decide whether an in kernel #MC can be\nrecovered.  When EX_TYPE_UACCESS is found, the PC jumps to recovery code\nspecified in _ASM_EXTABLE_FAULT() and return a -EFAULT to user space.\n\n- For instr case:\n\nIf a poison found while instruction fetching in user space, full recovery\nis possible.  User process takes #PF, Linux allocates a new page and fills\nby reading from storage.\n\n\n## 3. What actually happens and why\n\n- For copyin case: kernel panic since v5.17\n\nCommit 4c132d1d844a (&quot;x86/futex: Remove .fixup usage&quot;) introduced a new\nextable fixup type, EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG, and later patches updated the\nextable fixup type for copy-from-user operations, changing it from\nEX_TYPE_UACCESS to EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG.  It breaks previous EX_TYPE_UACCESS\nhandling when posion found in get_user() or copy_from_user().\n\n- For instr case: user process is killed by a SIGBUS signal due to #CMCI\n  and #MCE race\n\nWhen an uncorrected memory error is consumed there is a race between the\nCMCI from the memory controller reporting an uncorrected error with a UCNA\nsignature, and the core reporting and SRAR signature machine check when\nthe data is about to be consumed.\n\n### Background: why *UN*corrected errors tied to *C*MCI in Intel platform [1]\n\nPrior to Icelake memory controllers reported patrol scrub events that\ndetected a previously unseen uncorrected error in memory by signaling a\nbroadcast machine check with an SRAO (Software Recoverable Action\nOptional) signature in the machine check bank.  This was overkill because\nit&apos;s not an urgent problem that no core is on the verge of consuming that\nbad data.  It&apos;s also found that multi SRAO UCE may cause nested MCE\ninterrupts and finally become an IERR.\n\nHence, Intel downgrades the machine check bank signature of patrol scrub\nfrom SRAO to UCNA (Uncorrected, No Action required), and signal changed to\n#CMCI.  Just to add to the confusion, Linux does take an action (in\nuc_decode_notifier()) to try to offline the page despite the UC*NA*\nsignature name.\n\n### Background: why #CMCI and #MCE race when poison is consuming in\n    Intel platform [1]\n\nHaving decided that CMCI/UCNA is the best action for patrol scrub errors,\nthe memory controller uses it for reads too.  But the memory controller is\nexecuting asynchronously from the core, and can&apos;t tell the difference\nbetween a &quot;real&quot; read and a speculative read.  So it will do CMCI/UCNA if\nan error is found in any read.\n\nThus:\n\n1) Core is clever and thinks address A is needed soon, issues a\n   speculative read.\n\n2) Core finds it is going to use address A soon after sending the read\n   request\n\n3) The CMCI from the memory controller is in a race with MCE from the\n   core that will soon try to retire the load from address A.\n\nQuite often (because speculation has got better) the CMCI from the memory\ncontroller is delivered before the core is committed to the instruction\nreading address A, so the interrupt is taken, and Linux offlines the page\n(marking it as poison).\n\n\n## Why user process is killed for instr case\n\nCommit 046545a661af (&quot;mm/hwpoison: fix error page recovered but reported\n&quot;not\n---truncated---(CVE-2025-39989)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kernel","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/kernel&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["bpftool-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-devel-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-headers-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-source-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","perf-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["kernel-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["bpftool-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-devel-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-headers-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-source-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","perf-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-6.6.0-113.0.0.117.oe2403sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2537.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2537"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21801"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21917"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-37792"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-37914"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-37931"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38313"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38333"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38414"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38615"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38700"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38701"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38709"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-39691"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-39787"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-39795"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-39920"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-39923"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-39968"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-39971"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-39989"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
