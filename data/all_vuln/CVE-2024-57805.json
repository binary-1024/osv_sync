  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: SOF: Intel: hda-dai: Do not release the link DMA on STOP\n\nThe linkDMA should not be released on stop trigger since a stream re-start\nmight happen without closing of the stream. This leaves a short time for\nother streams to 'steal' the linkDMA since it has been released.\n\nThis issue is not easy to reproduce under normal conditions as usually\nafter stop the stream is closed, or the same stream is restarted, but if\nanother stream got in between the stop and start, like this:\naplay -Dhw:0,3 -c2 -r48000 -fS32_LE /dev/zero -d 120\nCTRL+z\naplay -Dhw:0,0 -c2 -r48000 -fS32_LE /dev/zero -d 120\n\nthen the link DMA channels will be mixed up, resulting firmware error or\ncrash.",
