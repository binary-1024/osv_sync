This leads to the file descriptor being inherited into the child process; the child process can then read from and write to it. This can leak sensitive information and also, if written to, be used to fill the disk or plant misinformation.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"pam-u2f","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:Pro:16.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/pam-u2f@1.0.3-1?arch=source&distro=esm-apps/xenial"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.1-1","1.0.2-1","1.0.3-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"libpam-u2f","binary_version":"1.0.3-1"},{"binary_name":"pamu2fcfg","binary_version":"1.0.3-1"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2019/UBUNTU-CVE-2019-12210.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pam-u2f","ecosystem":"Ubuntu:Pro:18.04:LTS","purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/pam-u2f@1.0.4-2?arch=source&distro=esm-apps/bionic"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.4-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"binaries":[{"binary_name":"libpam-u2f","binary_version":"1.0.4-2"},{"binary_name":"pamu2fcfg","binary_version":"1.0.4-2"}]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices/blob/main/osv/cve/2019/UBUNTU-CVE-2019-12210.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-12210"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/06/05/1"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://developers.yubico.com/pam-u2f/Release_Notes.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-12210"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"},{"type":"Ubuntu","score":"medium"}]}
