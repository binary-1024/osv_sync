As a consequence, during the FreeIPA installation process, it inadvertently leaks the administrative user credentials, including the administrator password, to the journal database. In the worst-case scenario, where the journal log is centralized, users with access to it can have improper access to the FreeIPA administrator credentials.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:0334"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2325557"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-11029"}]}
