In versions 1.7 and below, automatic loading of project-specific CLI configuration from the current working directory (<project>/.cursor/cli.json) could override certain global configurations in Cursor CLI. This allowed users running the CLI inside a malicious repository to be vulnerable to Remote Code Execution through a combination of permissive configuration (allowing shell commands) and prompt injection delivered via project-specific Rules (<project>/.cursor/rules/rule.mdc) or other mechanisms. The fix for this issue is currently available as a patch 2025.09.17-25b418f. As of October 3, 2025 there is no release version.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-61592.json","unresolved_versions":[{"events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1.7"}],"type":""}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/cursor/cursor/security/advisories/GHSA-v64q-396f-7m79"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
