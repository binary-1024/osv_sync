The main package includes the libvirtd server exporting the virtualization support.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA flaw was discovered in libvirt in the XML file processing. More specifically, the parsing of user provided XML files was performed before the ACL checks. A malicious user with limited permissions could exploit this flaw by submitting a specially crafted XML file, causing libvirt to allocate too much memory on the host. The excessive memory consumption could lead to a libvirt process crash on the host, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.(CVE-2025-12748)\n\nA flaw was found in libvirt. External inactive snapshots for shut-down VMs are incorrectly created as world-readable, making it possible for unprivileged users to inspect the guest OS contents. This results in an information disclosure
