In particular, it offers new paradigms for launching applications, accessing documents, and organizing open windows in GNOME. Later, it will introduce a new applets eco-system and offer new solutions for other desktop features, such as notifications and contacts management. The GNOME Shell is intended to replace functions handled by the GNOME Panel and by the window manager in previous versions of GNOME. The GNOME Shell has rich visual effects enabled by new graphical technologies.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nIt was discovered that the gnome-shell lock screen since version 3.15.91 did not properly restrict all contextual actions. An attacker with physical access to a locked workstation could invoke certain keyboard shortcuts, and potentially other actions.(CVE-2019-3820)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gnome-shell","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/gnome-shell&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.30.1-10.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["gnome-shell-3.30.1-10.oe1.aarch64.rpm","gnome-shell-debugsource-3.30.1-10.oe1.aarch64.rpm","gnome-shell-debuginfo-3.30.1-10.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["gnome-shell-help-3.30.1-10.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["gnome-shell-3.30.1-10.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["gnome-shell-3.30.1-10.oe1.x86_64.rpm","gnome-shell-debuginfo-3.30.1-10.oe1.x86_64.rpm","gnome-shell-debugsource-3.30.1-10.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1403.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gnome-shell","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP2","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/gnome-shell&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.30.1-10.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["gnome-shell-3.30.1-10.oe1.aarch64.rpm","gnome-shell-debugsource-3.30.1-10.oe1.aarch64.rpm","gnome-shell-debuginfo-3.30.1-10.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["gnome-shell-help-3.30.1-10.oe1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["gnome-shell-3.30.1-10.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["gnome-shell-3.30.1-10.oe1.x86_64.rpm","gnome-shell-debuginfo-3.30.1-10.oe1.x86_64.rpm","gnome-shell-debugsource-3.30.1-10.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1403.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1403"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3820"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
