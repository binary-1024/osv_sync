For example, an attack can occur over a network if the attacker has access to one iSCSI LUN. The attacker gains control over file access because I/O operations are proxied via an attacker-selected backstore.(CVE-2020-28374)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Some OSes (such as Linux, FreeBSD, and NetBSD) are processing watch events using a single thread. If the events are received faster than the thread is able to handle, they will get queued. As the queue is unbounded, a guest may be able to trigger an OOM in the backend. All systems with a FreeBSD, Linux, or NetBSD (any version) dom0 are vulnerable.(CVE-2020-29568)\r\n\r\nIn the nl80211_policy policy of nl80211.c, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local information disclosure with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not required for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-119770583(CVE-2020-27068)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernels implementation of MIDI, where an attacker with a local account and the permissions to issue an ioctl commands to midi devices, could trigger a use-after-free. A write to this specific memory while freed and before use could cause the flow of execution to change and possibly allow for memory corruption or privilege escalation.(CVE-2020-27786)\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.10.11. PI futexes have a kernel stack use-after-free during fault handling, allowing local users to execute code in the kernel, aka CID-34b1a1ce1458.(CVE-2021-3347)\r\n\r\nnbd_add_socket in drivers/block/nbd.c in the Linux kernel through 5.10.12 has an ndb_queue_rq use-after-free that could be triggered by local attackers (with access to the nbd device) via an I/O request at a certain point during device setup, aka CID-b98e762e3d71.(CVE-2021-3348)\n\nIn binder_release_work of binder.c, there is a possible use-after-free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.(CVE-2020-0423)\n\nmwifiex_cmd_802_11_ad_hoc_start in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/join.c in the Linux kernel through 5.10.4 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long SSID value, aka CID-5c455c5ab332.(CVE-2020-36158)\n\nInsufficient access control in the Linux kernel driver for some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.(CVE-2020-8694)\n\nIBM Power9 (AIX 7.1, 7.2, and VIOS 3.1) processors could allow a local user to obtain sensitive information from the data in the L1 cache under extenuating circumstances. (CVE-2020-4788)\n\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.2.13. nbd_genl_status in drivers/block/nbd.c does not check the nla_nest_start_noflag return value.(CVE-2019-16089)\n\nIn various methods of hid-multitouch.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.(CVE-2020-0465)\n\nIn do_epoll_ctl and ep_loop_check_proc of eventpoll.c, there is a possible use after free due to a logic error. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.(CVE-2020-0466)\n\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of string matching within a packet. A privileged user (with root or CAP_NET_ADMIN) when inserting iptables rules could insert a rule which can panic the system.(CVE-2021-20177)\n\nfs/nfsd/nfs3xdr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.10.8, when there is an NFS export of a subdirectory of a filesystem, allows remote attackers to traverse to other parts of the filesystem via READDIRPLUS. NOTE: some parties argue that such a subdirectory export is not intended to prevent this attack; see also the exports(5) no_subtree_check default behavior.(CVE-2021-3178)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kernel","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/kernel&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["bpftool-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.aarch64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.aarch64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["kernel-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python2-perf-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.x86_64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.x86_64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-4.19.90-2102.2.0.0057.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1087.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1087"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28374"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-29568"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27068"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27786"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3347"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3348"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-0423"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-36158"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8694"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16089"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-0465"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-0466"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20177"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3178"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
