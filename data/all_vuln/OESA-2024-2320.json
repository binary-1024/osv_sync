  "details": "Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser, designed for standards compliance, performance and portability.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nWhen a user typed a URL in the address bar or the search bar and quickly hit the enter key, a website could sometimes capture that event and then redirect the user before navigation occurred to the desired, entered address. To construct a convincing spoof the attacker would have had to guess what the user was typing, perhaps by suggesting it. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 84.(CVE-2020-26979)\r\n\r\nOne phishing tactic on the web is to provide a link with HTTP Auth. For example &apos;https://www.phishingtarget.com@evil.com&apos;. To mitigate this type of attack, Firefox will display a warning dialog; however, this warning dialog would not have been displayed if evil.com used a redirect that was cached by the browser. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 86.(CVE-2021-23972)",
