This flaw allows a local attacker with a user privilege to cause a denial of service.(CVE-2022-1184)\n\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.19. In pxa3xx_gcu_write in drivers/video/fbdev/pxa3xx-gcu.c, the count parameter has a type conflict of size_t versus int, causing an integer overflow and bypassing the size check. After that, because it is used as the third argument to copy_from_user(), a heap overflow may occur.(CVE-2022-39842)\n\nA race condition flaw was found in the Linux kernel sound subsystem due to improper locking. It could lead to a NULL pointer dereference while handling the SNDCTL_DSP_SYNC ioctl. A privileged local user (root or member of the audio group) could use this flaw to crash the system, resulting in a denial of service condition(CVE-2022-3303)\n\nAn issue was found in the Linux kernel in nf_conntrack_irc where the message handling can be confused and incorrectly matches the message. A firewall may be able to be bypassed when users are using unencrypted IRC with nf_conntrack_irc configured.(CVE-2022-2663)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kernel","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/kernel&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["python3-perf-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.aarch64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.aarch64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.aarch64.rpm","python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.aarch64.rpm","bpftool-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.aarch64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["kernel-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["python3-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debuginfo-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-debuginfo-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-debugsource-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python3-perf-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-debuginfo-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-devel-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.x86_64.rpm","perf-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.x86_64.rpm","bpftool-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-source-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.x86_64.rpm","kernel-tools-devel-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.x86_64.rpm","python2-perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.x86_64.rpm","perf-debuginfo-4.19.90-2210.1.0.0171.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-1991.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2022-1991"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1184"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39842"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3303"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2663"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
