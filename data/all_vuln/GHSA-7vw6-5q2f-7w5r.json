The issue allows a client to specify an arbitrary jwks_uri, which Keycloak then retrieves without validating the destination. This enables attackers to coerce the Keycloak server into making HTTP requests to internal or restricted network resources. As a result, attackers can probe internal services and cloud metadata endpoints, creating an information disclosure and reconnaissance risk.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.keycloak:keycloak-adapter-core","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-adapter-core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"25.0.3"}]}],"versions":["1.0-alpha-1","1.0-alpha-2","1.0-alpha-3","1.0-alpha-4","1.0-beta-1","1.0-beta-1-20150521","1.0-beta-1-20150523","1.0-beta-2","1.0-beta-3","1.0-beta-4","1.0-final","1.0-rc-1","1.0-rc-2","1.0.1.Final","1.0.2.Final","1.0.3.Final","1.0.4.Final","1.0.5.Final","1.1.0.Beta1","1.1.0.Beta2","1.1.0.Final","1.1.1.Final","1.2.0.Beta1","1.2.0.CR1","1.2.0.Final","1.3.0.Final","1.3.1.Final","1.4.0.Final","1.5.0-Final","1.5.0.Final","1.5.1.Final","1.6.0.Final","1.6.1.Final","1.7.0.CR1","1.7.0.Final","1.8.0.Alpha1","1.8.0.CR1","1.8.0.CR2","1.8.0.CR3","1.8.0.Final","1.8.1.Final","1.9.0.CR1","1.9.0.Final","1.9.1.Final","1.9.2.Final","1.9.3.Final","1.9.4.Final","1.9.5.Final","1.9.7.Final","1.9.8.Final","10.0.0","10.0.1","10.0.2","11.0.0","11.0.1","11.0.2","11.0.3","12.0.0","12.0.1","12.0.2","12.0.3","12.0.4","13.0.0","13.0.1","14.0.0","15.0.0","15.0.1","15.0.2","15.1.0","15.1.1","16.0.0","16.1.0","16.1.1","17.0.0","17.0.1","18.0.0","18.0.1","18.0.2","19.0.0","19.0.1","19.0.2","19.0.3","2.0.0.CR1","2.0.0.Final","2.1.0.CR1","2.1.0.Final","2.2.0.CR1","2.2.0.Final","2.2.1.Final","2.3.0.CR1","2.3.0.Final","2.4.0.CR1","2.4.0.Final","2.5.0.CR1","2.5.0.Final","2.5.1.Final","2.5.4.Final","2.5.5.Final","20.0.0","20.0.1","20.0.2","20.0.3","20.0.4","20.0.5","21.0.0","21.0.1","21.0.2","21.1.0","21.1.1","21.1.2","22.0.0","22.0.1","22.0.2","22.0.3","22.0.4","22.0.5","23.0.0","23.0.1","23.0.2","23.0.3","23.0.4","23.0.5","23.0.6","23.0.7","24.0.0","24.0.1","24.0.2","24.0.3","24.0.4","24.0.5","25.0.3","3.0.0.CR1","3.0.0.Final","3.1.0.CR1","3.1.0.Final","3.2.0.CR1","3.2.0.Final","3.2.1.Final","3.3.0.CR1","3.3.0.CR2","3.3.0.Final","3.4.0.CR1","3.4.0.Final","3.4.1.CR1","3.4.1.Final","3.4.2.Final","3.4.3.Final","4.0.0.Beta1","4.0.0.Beta2","4.0.0.Beta3","4.0.0.Final","4.1.0.Final","4.2.0.Final","4.2.1.Final","4.3.0.Final","4.4.0.Final","4.5.0.Final","4.6.0.Final","4.7.0.Final","4.8.0.Final","4.8.1.Final","4.8.2.Final","4.8.3.Final","5.0.0","6.0.0","6.0.1","7.0.0","7.0.1","8.0.0","8.0.1","8.0.2","9.0.0","9.0.2","9.0.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-7vw6-5q2f-7w5r/GHSA-7vw6-5q2f-7w5r.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-1180"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/45645"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2026-1180"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2430781"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-918"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-21T21:55:11Z","nvd_published_at":"2026-01-20T13:16:03Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
