It greatly simplifies and streamlines network programming such as TCP and UDP socket server.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nNetty before 4.1.42.Final mishandles whitespace before the colon in HTTP headers (such as a &quot;Transfer-Encoding : chunked&quot; line), which leads to HTTP request smuggling.(CVE-2019-16869)\r\n\r\nHttpObjectDecoder.java in Netty before 4.1.44 allows an HTTP header that lacks a colon, which might be interpreted as a separate header with an incorrect syntax, or might be interpreted as an &quot;invalid fold.&quot;(CVE-2019-20444)\r\n\r\nHttpObjectDecoder.java in Netty before 4.1.44 allows a Content-Length header to be accompanied by a second Content-Length header, or by a Transfer-Encoding header.(CVE-2019-20445)",
