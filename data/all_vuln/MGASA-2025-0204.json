Given\nautomated and repeated execution of dpkg-deb commands on adversarial\n.deb packages or with well compressible files, placed inside a directory\nwith permissions not allowing removal by a non-root user, this can end\nup in a DoS scenario due to causing disk quota exhaustion or disk full\nconditions.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"dpkg","ecosystem":"Mageia:9","purl":"pkg:rpm/mageia/dpkg?arch=source&distro=mageia-9"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.22.21-1.mga9"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"section":"core"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://advisories.mageia.org/MGASA-2025-0204.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://advisories.mageia.org/MGASA-2025-0204.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugs.mageia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=34441"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/security-announce@lists.opensuse.org/message/FNSLEIUKJQUM5CTEBYJAKWDXADY2FDTH/"}],"credits":[{"name":"Mageia","contact":["https://wiki.mageia.org/en/Packages_Security_Team"],"type":"COORDINATOR"}]}
