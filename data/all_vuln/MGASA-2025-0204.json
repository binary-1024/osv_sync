  "details": "It was discovered that dpkg-deb does not properly sanitize directory\npermissions when extracting a control member into a temporary directory,\nwhich is documented as being a safe operation even on untrusted data.\nThis may result in leaving temporary files behind on cleanup. Given\nautomated and repeated execution of dpkg-deb commands on adversarial\n.deb packages or with well compressible files, placed inside a directory\nwith permissions not allowing removal by a non-root user, this can end\nup in a DoS scenario due to causing disk quota exhaustion or disk full\nconditions.\n",
