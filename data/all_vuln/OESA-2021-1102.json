Docker containers are both hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic. This means they can run anywhere, from your laptop to the largest EC2 compute instance and everything in between - and they don't require you to use a particular language, framework or packaging system. That makes them great building blocks for deploying and scaling web apps, databases, and backend services without depending on a particular stack or provider.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nIn Docker before versions 9.03.15, 20.10.3 there is a vulnerability involving the --userns-remap option in which access to remapped root allows privilege escalation to real root. When using --userns-remap, if the root user in the remapped namespace has access to the host filesystem they can modify files under /var/lib/docker/&lt;remapping&gt; that cause writing files with extended privileges. Versions 20.10.3 and 19.03.15 contain patches that prevent privilege escalation from remapped user.(CVE-2021-21284)\r\n\r\nIn Docker before versions 9.03.15, 20.10.3 there is a vulnerability in which pulling an intentionally malformed Docker image manifest crashes the dockerd daemon. Versions 20.10.3 and 19.03.15 contain patches that prevent the daemon from crashing.(CVE-2021-21285)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"docker","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/docker&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"engine-18.09.0-202.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["docker-engine-18.09.0-202.oe1.aarch64.rpm","docker-engine-18.09.0-202.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["docker-engine-18.09.0-202.oe1.src.rpm","docker-engine-18.09.0-202.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["docker-engine-18.09.0-202.oe1.x86_64.rpm","docker-engine-18.09.0-202.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1102.json"}},{"package":{"name":"docker","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/docker&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"engine-18.09.0-202.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["docker-engine-18.09.0-202.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["docker-engine-18.09.0-202.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["docker-engine-18.09.0-202.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2021-1102.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2021-1102"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21284"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21285"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
