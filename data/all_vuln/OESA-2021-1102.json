  "details": "Docker is an open source project to build, ship and run any application as a lightweight container. Docker containers are both hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic. This means they can run anywhere, from your laptop to the largest EC2 compute instance and everything in between - and they don't require you to use a particular language, framework or packaging system. That makes them great building blocks for deploying and scaling web apps, databases, and backend services without depending on a particular stack or provider.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nIn Docker before versions 9.03.15, 20.10.3 there is a vulnerability involving the --userns-remap option in which access to remapped root allows privilege escalation to real root. When using --userns-remap, if the root user in the remapped namespace has access to the host filesystem they can modify files under /var/lib/docker/&lt;remapping&gt; that cause writing files with extended privileges. Versions 20.10.3 and 19.03.15 contain patches that prevent privilege escalation from remapped user.(CVE-2021-21284)\r\n\r\nIn Docker before versions 9.03.15, 20.10.3 there is a vulnerability in which pulling an intentionally malformed Docker image manifest crashes the dockerd daemon. Versions 20.10.3 and 19.03.15 contain patches that prevent the daemon from crashing.(CVE-2021-21285)",
