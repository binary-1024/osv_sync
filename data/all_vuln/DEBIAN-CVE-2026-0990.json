This uncontrolled recursion vulnerability occurs in the xmlCatalogXMLResolveURI function when an XML catalog contains a delegate URI entry that references itself. A remote attacker could exploit this configuration-dependent issue by providing a specially crafted XML catalog, leading to infinite recursion and call stack exhaustion. This ultimately results in a segmentation fault, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing affected applications.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libxml2","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libxml2?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["2.12.3+dfsg-0exp1","2.12.5+dfsg-0exp1","2.12.6+dfsg-0exp1","2.12.6+dfsg-0exp2","2.12.7+dfsg+really2.9.14-0.1","2.12.7+dfsg+really2.9.14-0.2","2.12.7+dfsg+really2.9.14-0.3","2.12.7+dfsg+really2.9.14-0.4","2.12.7+dfsg+really2.9.14-1","2.12.7+dfsg+really2.9.14-2","2.12.7+dfsg+really2.9.14-2.1","2.12.7+dfsg-1","2.12.7+dfsg-2","2.12.7+dfsg-3","2.13.1+dfsg-0exp1","2.13.3+dfsg-0exp1","2.13.3+dfsg-0exp2","2.14.1+dfsg-0exp1","2.14.2+dfsg-0exp1","2.14.3+dfsg-0exp1","2.14.3+dfsg-0exp2","2.14.3+dfsg-0exp3","2.14.4+dfsg-0exp1","2.14.5+dfsg-0.1","2.14.5+dfsg-0.2","2.14.5+dfsg-0exp1","2.14.5+dfsg-0exp2","2.14.6+dfsg-0.1","2.15.0+dfsg-0.1","2.15.0+dfsg-0.2","2.15.0+dfsg-0.3","2.15.1+dfsg-0.1","2.15.1+dfsg-0.2","2.15.1+dfsg-0.3","2.15.1+dfsg-0.4","2.15.1+dfsg-0.5","2.15.1+dfsg-1","2.15.1+dfsg-2","2.9.10+dfsg-6.7","2.9.10+dfsg-6.7+deb11u1","2.9.10+dfsg-6.7+deb11u2","2.9.10+dfsg-6.7+deb11u3","2.9.10+dfsg-6.7+deb11u4","2.9.10+dfsg-6.7+deb11u5","2.9.10+dfsg-6.7+deb11u6","2.9.10+dfsg-6.7+deb11u7","2.9.10+dfsg-6.7+deb11u8","2.9.10+dfsg-6.7+deb11u9","2.9.12+dfsg-1","2.9.12+dfsg-2","2.9.12+dfsg-3","2.9.12+dfsg-4","2.9.12+dfsg-5","2.9.12+dfsg-6","2.9.13+dfsg-1","2.9.14+dfsg-1","2.9.14+dfsg-1.1","2.9.14+dfsg-1.2","2.9.14+dfsg-1.3","2.9.14+dfsg-1.3~deb12u1","2.9.14+dfsg-1.3~deb12u2","2.9.14+dfsg-1.3~deb12u3","2.9.14+dfsg-1.3~deb12u4","2.9.14+dfsg-1.3~deb12u5"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not
