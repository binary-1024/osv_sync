Libtpms, which is derived from the TPM 2.0 reference implementation code published by the Trusted Computing Group, is prone to a potential out of bounds (OOB) read vulnerability. The vulnerability occurs in the ‘CryptHmacSign’ function with an inconsistent pairing of the signKey and signScheme parameters, where the signKey is ALG_KEYEDHASH key and inScheme is an ECC or RSA scheme. The reported vulnerability is in the ‘CryptHmacSign’ function, which is defined in the &quot;Part 4: Supporting Routines – Code&quot; document, section &quot;7.151 - /tpm/src/crypt/CryptUtil.c &quot;. This vulnerability can be triggered from user-mode applications by sending malicious commands to a TPM 2.0/vTPM (swtpm) whose firmware is based on an affected TCG reference implementation. The effect on libtpms is that it will cause an abort due to the detection of the out-of-bounds access, thus for example making a vTPM (swtpm) unavailable to a VM. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.7.12, 0.8.10, 0.9.7, and 0.10.1.(CVE-2025-49133)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libtpms","ecosystem":"openEuler:24.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/libtpms&distro=openEuler-24.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.9.5-5.oe2403"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libtpms-0.9.5-5.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","libtpms-debuginfo-0.9.5-5.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","libtpms-debugsource-0.9.5-5.oe2403.aarch64.rpm","libtpms-devel-0.9.5-5.oe2403.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["libtpms-0.9.5-5.oe2403.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libtpms-0.9.5-5.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","libtpms-debuginfo-0.9.5-5.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","libtpms-debugsource-0.9.5-5.oe2403.x86_64.rpm","libtpms-devel-0.9.5-5.oe2403.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2025-2261.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/zh/security/security-bulletins/detail/?id=openEuler-SA-2025-2261"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49133"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Medium"}}
