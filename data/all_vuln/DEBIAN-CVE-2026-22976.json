{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2026-22976","published":"2026-01-21T07:16:01.433Z","modified":"2026-01-22T04:16:24.591139Z","upstream":["CVE-2026-22976"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/sched: sch_qfq: Fix NULL deref when deactivating inactive aggregate in qfq_reset  `qfq_class->leaf_qdisc->q.qlen > 0` does not imply that the class itself is active.  Two qfq_class objects may point to the same leaf_qdisc. This happens when:  1. one QFQ qdisc is attached to the dev as the root qdisc, and  2. another QFQ qdisc is temporarily referenced (e.g., via qdisc_get() / qdisc_put()) and is pending to be destroyed, as in function tc_new_tfilter.  When packets are enqueued through the root QFQ qdisc, the shared leaf_qdisc->q.qlen increases. At the same time, the second QFQ qdisc triggers qdisc_put and qdisc_destroy: the qdisc enters qfq_reset() with its own q->q.qlen == 0, but its class's leaf qdisc->q.qlen > 0. Therefore, the qfq_reset would wrongly deactivate an inactive aggregate and trigger a null-deref in qfq_deactivate_agg:  [    0.903172] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000 [    0.903571] #PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode [    0.903860] #PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page [    0.904177] PGD 10299b067 P4D 10299b067 PUD 10299c067 PMD 0 [    0.904502] Oops: Oops: 0002 [#1] SMP NOPTI [    0.904737] CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 135 Comm: exploit Not tainted 6.19.0-rc3+ #2 NONE [    0.905157] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.17.0-0-gb52ca86e094d-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014 [    0.905754] RIP: 0010:qfq_deactivate_agg (include/linux/list.h:992 (discriminator 2) include/linux/list.h:1006 (discriminator 2) net/sched/sch_qfq.c:1367 (discriminator 2) net/sched/sch_qfq.c:1393 (discriminator 2)) [    0.906046] Code: 0f 84 4d 01 00 00 48 89 70 18 8b 4b 10 48 c7 c2 ff ff ff ff 48 8b 78 08 48 d3 e2 48 21 f2 48 2b 13 48 8b 30 48 d3 ea 8b 4b 18 0  Code starting with the faulting instruction ===========================================    0:\t0f 84 4d 01 00 00    \tje     0x153    6:\t48 89 70 18          \tmov    %rsi,0x18(%rax)    a:\t8b 4b 10             \tmov    0x10(%rbx),%ecx    d:\t48 c7 c2 ff ff ff ff \tmov    $0xffffffffffffffff,%rdx   14:\t48 8b 78 08          \tmov    0x8(%rax),%rdi   18:\t48 d3 e2             \tshl    %cl,%rdx   1b:\t48 21 f2             \tand    %rsi,%rdx   1e:\t48 2b 13             \tsub    (%rbx),%rdx   21:\t48 8b 30             \tmov    (%rax),%rsi   24:\t48 d3 ea             \tshr    %cl,%rdx   27:\t8b 4b 18             \tmov    0x18(%rbx),%ecx \t...
