A malicious project assigned as a node owner can provide a path to any local file (readable by ironic-conductor), which may then be written to the target node disk. This is difficult to exploit in practice, because a node deployed in this manner should never reach the ACTIVE state, but it still represents a danger in environments running with non-default, insecure configurations such as with automated cleaning disabled. The fixed versions are 24.1.3, 26.1.1, and 29.0.1.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ironic","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ironic?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:16.0.3-1","1:16.2.0-1","1:17.0.0-1","1:17.0.1-1","1:17.0.3-1","1:17.0.3-2","1:18.1.0-1","1:18.2.0-1","1:18.2.0-2","1:18.2.0-3","1:20.0.0-1","1:20.1.0-1","1:20.1.0-2","1:21.0.0-1","1:21.0.0-2","1:21.0.0-3","1:21.1.0-1","1:21.1.0-2","1:21.1.0-3","1:21.3.0-1","1:21.4.0-1","1:21.4.0-2","1:21.4.0-3","1:21.4.0-4","1:22.1.0-1","1:23.0.0-1","1:23.0.0-2","1:23.0.0-3","1:23.0.0-4","1:24.0.0-1","1:24.1.0-1","1:24.1.1-1","1:24.1.1-2","1:24.1.1-3","1:26.0.0-1","1:26.0.0-2","1:26.1.0-1","1:26.1.0-2","1:26.1.0-3","1:26.1.1-1","1:26.1.1-2","1:26.1.1-3","1:26.1.1-4","1:29.0.0-1","1:29.0.0-2","1:29.0.0-3","1:29.0.0-4","1:29.0.0-5","1:29.0.0-6","1:29.0.0-7","1:32.0.0-1","1:32.0.0-2","1:32.0.0-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-44021.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ironic","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ironic?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1:21.1.0-3","1:21.3.0-1","1:21.4.0-1","1:21.4.0-2","1:21.4.0-3","1:21.4.0-4","1:22.1.0-1","1:23.0.0-1","1:23.0.0-2","1:23.0.0-3","1:23.0.0-4","1:24.0.0-1","1:24.1.0-1","1:24.1.1-1","1:24.1.1-2","1:24.1.1-3","1:26.0.0-1","1:26.0.0-2","1:26.1.0-1","1:26.1.0-2","1:26.1.0-3","1:26.1.1-1","1:26.1.1-2","1:26.1.1-3","1:26.1.1-4","1:29.0.0-1","1:29.0.0-2","1:29.0.0-3","1:29.0.0-4","1:29.0.0-5","1:29.0.0-6","1:29.0.0-7","1:32.0.0-1","1:32.0.0-2","1:32.0.0-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-44021.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ironic","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ironic?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:29.0.0-6"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-44021.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ironic","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ironic?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:29.0.0-6"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-44021.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-44021"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
