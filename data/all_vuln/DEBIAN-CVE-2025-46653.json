NOTE: this does not imply that, in a typical use case, attackers will be able to exploit any hexoid behavior to upload and execute their own content.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"node-formidable","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-formidable?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.1+20200129git8231ea6-1","1.2.1+20200129git8231ea6-2","3.2.1+20220105git2815e91+~cs4.0.6-1","3.2.1+20220105git2815e91+~cs4.0.6-2","3.2.1+20220105git2815e91+~cs4.0.6-3","3.2.1+20220105git2815e91+~cs4.0.6-4","3.2.3+20220426git971e3a7+~cs4.0.8-1","3.2.4+20220519git81dd350+~cs4.0.9-1","3.2.4+20220822gitd285a08+~cs4.0.9-1","3.2.5+20221017git493ec88+~cs4.0.9-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-46653.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-formidable","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-formidable?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.2.5+20221017git493ec88+~cs4.0.9-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-46653.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-formidable","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-formidable?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.2.5+20221017git493ec88+~cs4.0.9-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-46653.json"}},{"package":{"name":"node-formidable","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-formidable?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.2.5+20221017git493ec88+~cs4.0.9-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-46653.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-46653"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
