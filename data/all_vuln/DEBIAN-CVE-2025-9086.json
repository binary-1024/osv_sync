{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-9086","published":"2025-09-12T06:15:44.100Z","modified":"2026-01-14T02:14:22.719369Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-9086"],"details":"1. A cookie is set using the `secure` keyword for `https://target`   2. curl is redirected to or otherwise made to speak with `http://target` (same     hostname, but using clear text HTTP) using the same cookie set   3. The same cookie name is set - but with just a slash as path (`path=\\\"/\\\",`).    Since this site is not secure, the cookie *should* just be ignored. 4. A bug in the path comparison logic makes curl read outside a heap buffer    boundary  The bug either causes a crash or it potentially makes the comparison come to the wrong conclusion and lets the clear-text site override the contents of the secure cookie, contrary to expectations and depending on the memory contents immediately following the single-byte allocation that holds the path.  The presumed and correct behavior would be to plainly ignore the second set of the cookie since it was already set as secure on a secure host so overriding it on an insecure host should not be okay.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/curl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.74.0-1.3+deb11u16"}]}],"versions":["7.74.0-1.3","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u1","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u10","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u11","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u12","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u13","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u14","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u15","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u2","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u3","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u4","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u5","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u6","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u7","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u7~bpo11+1","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u8","7.74.0-1.3+deb11u9"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-9086.json"}},{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/curl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.14.1-2+deb13u1"}]}],"versions":["8.14.1-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-9086.json"}},{"package":{"name":"curl","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/curl?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.16.0~rc2-1"}]}],"versions":["8.14.1-2","8.14.1-2+exp1","8.15.0-1","8.15.0-1~bpo13+1","8.15.0-1~exp1","8.15.0~rc1-1exp1","8.15.0~rc2-1~exp1","8.15.0~rc3-1~exp1","8.16.0~rc1-1~exp1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-9086.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-9086"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
