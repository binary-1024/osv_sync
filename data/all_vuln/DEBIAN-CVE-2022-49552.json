By itself it wouldn't have been an issue, but jit_subprogs() logic relies on two step process to JIT all subprogs and then JIT them again when addresses of all subprogs are known. Blinding process in the first JIT phase caused second JIT to miss adjustment of special ld_imm64.  Fix this issue by ignoring special ld_imm64 instructions that don't have user controlled constants and shouldn't be blinded.",
