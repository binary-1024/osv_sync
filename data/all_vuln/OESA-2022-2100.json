  "details": "Bash is the GNU Project's shell. Bash is the Bourne Again SHell. Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh). It is intended to conform to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard. It offers functional improvements over sh for both programming and interactive use. In addition, most sh scripts can be run by Bash without modification.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the bash package, where a heap-buffer overflow can occur in valid_parameter_transform. This issue may lead to memory problems.(CVE-2022-3715)",
