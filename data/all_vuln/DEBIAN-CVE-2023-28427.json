In versions prior to 24.0.0 events sent with special strings in key places can temporarily disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly, potentially impacting the consumer's ability to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating normally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data presented to the consumer. This vulnerability is distinct from GHSA-rfv9-x7hh-xc32 which covers a similar issue. The issue has been patched in matrix-js-sdk 24.0.0 and users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"node-matrix-js-sdk","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/node-matrix-js-sdk?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["9.11.0+~cs9.9.16-1","9.11.0+~cs9.9.16-2","9.3.0+~cs9.9.16-2","9.7.0~~rc1+~cs9.9.16-1","9.7.0~~rc1+~cs9.9.16-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-28427.json"}},{"package":{"name":"thunderbird","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/thunderbird?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:102.10.0-1~deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["1:102.0.1-1","1:102.0.2-1","1:102.0~b4-1","1:102.0~b7-1","1:102.1.0-1","1:102.1.1-1","1:102.1.2-1","1:102.10.0-1~deb10u1","1:102.2.0-1","1:102.2.1-1","1:102.2.2-1","1:102.3.0-1","1:102.3.0-1~deb10u1","1:102.3.0-1~deb11u1","1:102.3.1-1","1:102.3.2-1","1:102.3.3-1","1:102.4.0-1","1:102.4.0-1~deb10u1","1:102.4.0-1~deb11u1","1:102.4.1-1","1:102.5.0-1","1:102.5.0-1~deb10u1","1:102.5.0-1~deb11u1","1:102.5.1-1","1:102.6.0-1","1:102.6.0-1~deb10u1","1:102.6.0-1~deb11u1","1:102.7.1+1-1","1:102.7.1-1","1:102.7.2-1","1:102.8.0-1","1:102.8.0-1~deb10u1","1:102.8.0-1~deb11u1","1:102.9.0-1","1:102.9.0-1~deb10u1","1:102.9.0-1~deb11u1","1:102.9.1-1","1:78.12.0-1","1:78.13.0-1","1:78.13.0-1~deb10u1","1:78.13.0-1~deb11u1","1:78.13.0-1~deb9u1","1:78.14.0-1","1:78.14.0-1~deb10u1","1:78.14.0-1~deb11u1","1:78.14.0-1~deb9u1","1:84.0~b3-1","1:85.0~b3-1","1:86.0~b3-1","1:88.0~b2-1","1:89.0~b2-1","1:90.0~b2-1","1:91.0-1","1:91.0.2-1","1:91.0~b1-1","1:91.0~b3-1","1:91.0~b5-1","1:91.1.0-1","1:91.1.1-1","1:91.10.0-1","1:91.10.0-1~deb10u1","1:91.10.0-1~deb11u1","1:91.10.0-1~deb9u1","1:91.11.0-1","1:91.11.0-1~deb10u1","1:91.11.0-1~deb11u1","1:91.12.0-1~deb10u1","1:91.12.0-1~deb11u1","1:91.13.0-1~deb10u1","1:91.13.0-1~deb11u1","1:91.2.0-1","1:91.2.1-1","1:91.3.0-1","1:91.3.2-1","1:91.4.0-1","1:91.4.1-1","1:91.4.1-1~deb10u1","1:91.4.1-1~deb11u1","1:91.4.1-1~deb9u1","1:91.5.0-1","1:91.5.0-1~deb9u1","1:91.5.0-2","1:91.5.0-2~deb10u1","1:91.5.0-2~deb11u1","1:91.5.1-1","1:91.6.0-1","1:91.6.0-1~deb10u1","1:91.6.0-1~deb11u1","1:91.6.0-1~deb9u1","1:91.6.1-1","1:91.6.1-1~deb10u1","1:91.6.1-1~deb11u1","1:91.6.1-1~deb9u1","1:91.6.2-1","1:91.6.2-1~deb10u1","1:91.6.2-1~deb11u1","1:91.6.2-1~deb9u1","1:91.7.0-1","1:91.7.0-2","1:91.7.0-2~deb10u1","1:91.7.0-2~deb11u1","1:91.7.0-2~deb9u1","1:91.8.0-1","1:91.8.0-1~deb10u1","1:91.8.0-1~deb11u1","1:91.8.0-1~deb9u1","1:91.8.1-1","1:91.9.0-1","1:91.9.0-1~deb10u1","1:91.9.0-1~deb11u1","1:91.9.0-1~deb9u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-28427.json"}},{"package":{"name":"thunderbird","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/thunderbird?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:102.9.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-28427.json"}},{"package":{"name":"thunderbird","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/thunderbird?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:102.9.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-28427.json"}},{"package":{"name":"thunderbird","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/thunderbird?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1:102.9.1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-28427.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-28427"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H"}]}
