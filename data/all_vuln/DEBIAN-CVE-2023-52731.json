  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fbdev: Fix invalid page access after closing deferred I/O devices  When a fbdev with deferred I/O is once opened and closed, the dirty pages still remain queued in the pageref list, and eventually later those may be processed in the delayed work.  This may lead to a corruption of pages, hitting an Oops.  This patch makes sure to cancel the delayed work and clean up the pageref list at closing the device for addressing the bug.  A part of the cleanup code is factored out as a new helper function that is called from the common fb_release().",
