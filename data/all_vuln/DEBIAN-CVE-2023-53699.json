{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2023-53699","published":"2025-10-22T14:15:44Z","modified":"2025-10-23T09:03:46.154628Z","upstream":["CVE-2023-53699"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  riscv: move memblock_allow_resize() after linear mapping is ready  The initial memblock metadata is accessed from kernel image mapping. The regions arrays need to \"reallocated\" from memblock and accessed through linear mapping to cover more memblock regions. So the resizing should not be allowed until linear mapping is ready. Note that there are memblock allocations when building linear mapping.  This patch is similar to 24cc61d8cb5a (\"arm64: memblock: don't permit memblock resizing until linear mapping is up\").  In following log, many memblock regions are reserved before create_linear_mapping_page_table(). And then it triggered reallocation of memblock.reserved.regions and memcpy the old array in kernel image mapping to the new array in linear mapping which caused a page fault.
