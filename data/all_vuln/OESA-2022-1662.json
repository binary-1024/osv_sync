An integer overflow in the cursor_alloc() function can lead to the allocation of a small cursor object followed by a subsequent heap-based buffer overflow. This flaw allows a malicious privileged guest user to crash the QEMU process on the host or potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process.(CVE-2021-4206)\n\nA flaw was found in the QXL display device emulation in QEMU. A double fetch of guest controlled values cursor->header.width and cursor->header.height can lead to the allocation of a small cursor object followed by a subsequent heap-based buffer overflow. A malicious privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host or potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process.(CVE-2021-4207)\n\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the floppy disk emulator of QEMU. This issue occurs while processing read/write ioport commands if the selected floppy drive is not initialized with a block device. This flaw allows a privileged guest user to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-20196)\n\nA flaw was found in the virtio-net device of QEMU. This flaw was inadvertently introduced with the fix for CVE-2021-3748, which forgot to unmap the cached virtqueue elements on error, leading to memory leakage and other unexpected results. Affected QEMU version: 6.2.0.(CVE-2022-26353)\n\nA flaw was found in the vhost-vsock device of QEMU. In case of error, an invalid element was not detached from the virtqueue before freeing its memory, leading to memory leakage and other unexpected results.
