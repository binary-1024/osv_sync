Prior to version 20251107, pdfminer.six will execute arbitrary code from a malicious pickle file if provided with a malicious PDF file. The `CMapDB._load_data()` function in pdfminer.six uses `pickle.loads()` to deserialize pickle files. These pickle files are supposed to be part of the pdfminer.six distribution stored in the `cmap/` directory, but a malicious PDF can specify an alternative directory and filename as long as the filename ends in `.pickle.gz`. A malicious, zipped pickle file can then contain code which will automatically execute when the PDF is processed. Version 20251107 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"pdfminer","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/pdfminer?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"20200726-1+deb11u2"}]}],"versions":["20200726-1","20200726-1+deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-64512.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pdfminer","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/pdfminer?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"20221105+dfsg-1.1~deb12u1"}]}],"versions":["20221105+dfsg-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-64512.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pdfminer","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/pdfminer?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"20221105+dfsg-1.1~deb13u1"}]}],"versions":["20221105+dfsg-1","20221105+dfsg-1.1~deb12u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-64512.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pdfminer","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/pdfminer?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"20260107+dfsg-1"}]}],"versions":["20221105+dfsg-1","20221105+dfsg-1.1","20221105+dfsg-1.1~deb12u1","20221105+dfsg-1.1~deb13u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-64512.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-64512"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
