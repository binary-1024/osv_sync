In the past, there were similar failures reported by CI from other IGT tests, observed on other platforms.  Before commit 63baf4f3d587 (\"drm/i915/gt: Only wait for GPU activity before unbinding a GGTT fence\"), i915_vma_revoke_fence() was waiting for idleness of vma->active via fence_update().   That commit introduced vma->fence->active in order for the fence_update() to be able to wait selectively on that one instead of vma->active since only idleness of fence registers was needed.  But then, another commit 0d86ee35097a (\"drm/i915/gt: Make fence revocation unequivocal\") replaced the call to fence_update() in i915_vma_revoke_fence() with only fence_write(), and also added that GEM_BUG_ON(!i915_active_is_idle(&fence->active)) in front. No justification was provided on why we might then expect idleness of vma->fence->active without first waiting on it.  The issue can be potentially caused by a race among revocation of fence registers on one side and sequential execution of signal callbacks invoked on completion of a request that was using them on the other, still processed in parallel to revocation of those fence registers.  Fix it by waiting for idleness of vma->fence->active in i915_vma_revoke_fence().
