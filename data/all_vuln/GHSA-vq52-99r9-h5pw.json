Given the URL http://127.0.0.1?@127.2.2.2/, the URI function will parse and see the host as 127.0.0.1 (which is correct), and hackney will refer the host as 127.2.2.2/. This vulnerability can be exploited when users rely on the URL function for host checking.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"hackney","ecosystem":"Hex","purl":"pkg:hex/hackney"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.21.0"}]}],"versions":["0.13.1","0.14.0","0.14.1","0.14.2","0.14.3","0.15.0","0.15.2","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.1.0","1.10.0","1.10.1","1.11.0","1.12.0","1.12.1","1.13.0","1.14.0","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.15.0","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.0","1.17.0","1.17.1","1.17.2","1.17.3","1.17.4","1.18.0","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19.0","1.19.1","1.2.0","1.20.0","1.20.1","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.10","1.4.2","1.4.3","1.4.4","1.4.5","1.4.6","1.4.7","1.4.8","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.5.2","1.5.3","1.5.4","1.5.5","1.5.6","1.5.7","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.6.3","1.6.4","1.6.5","1.6.6","1.7.0","1.7.1","1.8.0","1.8.2","1.8.3","1.8.4","1.8.5","1.8.6","1.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/02/GHSA-vq52-99r9-h5pw/GHSA-vq52-99r9-h5pw.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-1211"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/benoitc/hackney/commit/9594ce58fabd32cd897fc28fae937694515a3d4a"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://gist.github.com/snoopysecurity/996de09ec0cfd0ebdcfdda8ff515deb1"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/benoitc/hackney"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/benoitc/hackney/releases/tag/1.21.0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-HEX-HACKNEY-6516131"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Tsai-A-New-Era-Of-SSRF-Exploiting-URL-Parser-In-Trending-Programming-Languages.pdf"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-918"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-02-11T17:59:52Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-02-11T05:15:14Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:L/E:P"}]}
