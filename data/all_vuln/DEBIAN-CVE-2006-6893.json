{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2006-6893","published":"2006-12-31T05:00:00Z","modified":"2025-09-30T05:02:52.827332Z","upstream":["CVE-2006-6893"],"details":"Tor allows remote attackers to discover the IP address of a hidden service by accessing this service at a high rate, thereby changing the server's CPU temperature and consequently changing the pattern of time values visible through (1) ICMP timestamps, (2) TCP sequence numbers, and (3) TCP timestamps, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-0414. NOTE: it could be argued that this is a laws-of-physics vulnerability that is a fundamental design limitation of certain hardware implementations, so perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"tor","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/tor?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.4.5.10-1","0.4.5.10-1~bpo10+1","0.4.5.10-1~deb11u1","0.4.5.16-1","0.4.5.9-1","0.4.6.10-1","0.4.6.10-1~bpo10+1","0.4.6.10-1~bpo11+1","0.4.6.2-alpha-1","0.4.6.3-rc-1","0.4.6.4-rc-1","0.4.6.6-1","0.4.6.7-1","0.4.6.8-1","0.4.6.8-1~bpo10+2","0.4.6.8-1~bpo11+2","0.4.6.9-1","0.4.7.10-1","0.4.7.10-1~bpo10+1","0.4.7.10-1~bpo11+1","0.4.7.11-1","0.4.7.11-1~bpo11+1","0.4.7.12-1","0.4.7.13-1","0.4.7.13-1~bpo11+1","0.4.7.16-1","0.4.7.3-alpha-1","0.4.7.4-alpha-1","0.4.7.5-alpha-1","0.4.7.6-rc-1","0.4.7.7-1","0.4.7.7-1~bpo10+1","0.4.7.7-1~bpo11+1","0.4.7.8-1","0.4.7.8-1~bpo10+1","0.4.7.8-1~bpo11+1","0.4.7.9-1","0.4.8.10-1","0.4.8.10-1~bpo11+1","0.4.8.10-1~bpo12+1","0.4.8.11-1","0.4.8.11-1~bpo11+1","0.4.8.11-1~bpo12+1","0.4.8.12-1","0.4.8.12-1.1","0.4.8.12-1~bpo11+1","0.4.8.12-1~bpo12+1","0.4.8.13-1","0.4.8.13-2","0.4.8.13-2~bpo12+1","0.4.8.14-1","0.4.8.14-1~bpo12+1","0.4.8.16-1","0.4.8.4-2","0.4.8.5-1","0.4.8.6-1","0.4.8.7-1","0.4.8.8-1","0.4.8.9-1","0.4.8.9-1~bpo11+1","0.4.8.9-1~bpo12+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2006-6893.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tor","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/tor?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.4.7.13-1","0.4.7.16-1","0.4.8.10-1","0.4.8.10-1~bpo11+1","0.4.8.10-1~bpo12+1","0.4.8.11-1","0.4.8.11-1~bpo11+1","0.4.8.11-1~bpo12+1","0.4.8.12-1","0.4.8.12-1.1","0.4.8.12-1~bpo11+1","0.4.8.12-1~bpo12+1","0.4.8.13-1","0.4.8.13-2","0.4.8.13-2~bpo12+1","0.4.8.14-1","0.4.8.14-1~bpo12+1","0.4.8.16-1","0.4.8.4-2","0.4.8.5-1","0.4.8.6-1","0.4.8.7-1","0.4.8.8-1","0.4.8.9-1","0.4.8.9-1~bpo11+1","0.4.8.9-1~bpo12+1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2006-6893.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tor","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/tor?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.4.8.16-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2006-6893.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tor","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/tor?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.4.8.16-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2006-6893.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-6893"}]}
