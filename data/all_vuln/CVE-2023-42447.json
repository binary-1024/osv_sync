In version 0.1.1, the blurhash parsing code may panic due to multiple panic-guarded out-of-bounds accesses on untrusted input. In a typical deployment, this may get triggered by feeding a maliciously crafted blurhashes over the network. These may include UTF-8 compliant strings containing multi-byte UTF-8 characters. A patch is available in version 0.2.0, which requires user intervention because of slight API churn. No known workarounds are available.","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-42447.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/whisperfish/blurhash-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-cxvp-82cq-57h2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1284","CWE-248","CWE-392"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
