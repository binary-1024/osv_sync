Prior to 1.5.7 and 1.6.2, EnvoyExtensionPolicy Lua scripts executed by Envoy proxy can be used to leak the proxy's credentials. These credentials can then be used to communicate with the control plane and gain access to all secrets that are used by Envoy proxy, e.g. TLS private keys and credentials used for downstream and upstream communication. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.5.7 and 1.6.2.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"envoy-gateway","ecosystem":"Bitnami","purl":"pkg:bitnami/envoy-gateway"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.7"},{"introduced":"1.6.0"},{"fixed":"1.6.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/bitnami/vulndb/tree/main/data/envoy-gateway/BIT-envoy-gateway-2026-22771.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway/security/advisories/GHSA-xrwg-mqj6-6m22"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22771"}],"database_specific":{"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:gateway:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:gateway:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"severity":"High"}}
