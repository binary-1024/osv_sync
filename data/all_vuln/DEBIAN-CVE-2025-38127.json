  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: fix Tx scheduler error handling in XDP callback  When the XDP program is loaded, the XDP callback adds new Tx queues. This means that the callback must update the Tx scheduler with the new queue number. In the event of a Tx scheduler failure, the XDP callback should also fail and roll back any changes previously made for XDP preparation.  The previous implementation had a bug that not all changes made by the XDP callback were rolled back. This caused the crash with the following call trace:  [  +9.549584] ice 0000:ca:00.0: Failed VSI LAN queue config for XDP, error: -5 [  +0.382335] Oops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0x50a2250a90495525: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI [  +0.010710] CPU: 103 UID: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/103 Not tainted 6.14.0-net-next-mar-31+ #14 PREEMPT(voluntary) [  +0.010175] Hardware name: Intel Corporation M50CYP2SBSTD/M50CYP2SBSTD, BIOS SE5C620.86B.01.01.0005.2202160810 02/16/2022 [  +0.010946] RIP: 0010:__ice_update_sample+0x39/0xe0 [ice]  [...]  [  +0.002715] Call Trace: [  +0.002452]  <IRQ> [  +0.002021]  ? __die_body.cold+0x19/0x29 [  +0.003922]  ? die_addr+0x3c/0x60 [  +0.003319]  ? exc_general_protection+0x17c/0x400 [  +0.004707]  ? asm_exc_general_protection+0x26/0x30 [  +0.004879]  ? __ice_update_sample+0x39/0xe0 [ice] [  +0.004835]  ice_napi_poll+0x665/0x680 [ice] [  +0.004320]  __napi_poll+0x28/0x190 [  +0.003500]  net_rx_action+0x198/0x360 [  +0.003752]  ? update_rq_clock+0x39/0x220 [  +0.004013]  handle_softirqs+0xf1/0x340 [  +0.003840]  ? sched_clock_cpu+0xf/0x1f0 [  +0.003925]  __irq_exit_rcu+0xc2/0xe0 [  +0.003665]  common_interrupt+0x85/0xa0 [  +0.003839]  </IRQ> [  +0.002098]  <TASK> [  +0.002106]  asm_common_interrupt+0x26/0x40 [  +0.004184] RIP: 0010:cpuidle_enter_state+0xd3/0x690  Fix this by performing the missing unmapping of XDP queues from q_vectors and setting the XDP rings pointer back to NULL after all those queues are released.
