A symlink traversal vulnerability in the containers/storage library can cause Podman, Buildah, and CRI-O to hang and result in a denial of service via OOM kill when running a malicious image using an automatically assigned user namespace (`--userns=auto` in Podman and Buildah). The containers/storage library will read /etc/passwd inside the container, but does not properly validate if that file is a symlink, which can be used to cause the library to read an arbitrary file on the host.","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10289"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8418"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8428"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8437"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8686"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8690"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8694"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8700"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8984"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9051"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9454"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9459"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9926"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:0876"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2454"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2710"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:3301"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-9676"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wq2p-5pc6-wpgf"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2317467"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
