  "details": "Updated patch package fixes security vulnerabilities:\n\n* In GNU patch through 2.7.6, the following of symlinks is mishandled\n  in certain cases other than input files. (CVE-2019-13636).\n\n* A vulnerability was found in GNU patch through 2.7.6 is vulnerable to\n  OS shell command injection that can be exploited by opening a crafted\n  patch file that contains an ed style diff payload with shell\n  metacharacters (CVE-2019-13638).\n\n* A vulnerability was found in do_ed_script in pch.c in GNU patch through\n  2.7.6 does not block strings beginning with a ! character. NOTE: this\n is the same commit as for CVE-2019-13638, but the ! syntax is specific to\n  ed, and is unrelated to a shell metacharacter (CVE-2018-20969).\n",
