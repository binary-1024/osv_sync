{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-24123","published":"2026-01-26T22:14:39.709Z","modified":"2026-01-28T05:52:46.791345Z","aliases":["GHSA-6r62-w2q3-48hf"],"summary":"BentoML has a Path Traversal via Bentofile Configuration","details":"BentoML is a Python library for building online serving systems optimized for AI apps and model inference. Prior to version 1.4.34, BentoML's `bentofile.yaml` configuration allows path traversal attacks through multiple file path fields (`description`, `docker.setup_script`, `docker.dockerfile_template`, `conda.environment_yml`). An attacker can craft a malicious bentofile that, when built by a victim, exfiltrates arbitrary files from the filesystem into the bento archive. This enables supply chain attacks where sensitive files (SSH keys, credentials, environment variables) are silently embedded in bentos and exposed when pushed to registries or deployed. Version 1.4.34 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bentoml/bentoml","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"84d08cfeb40c5f2ce71b3d3444bbaa0fb16b5ca4"}]}],"versions":["0.0.5-alpha","0.0.8.post1-beta","0.1.1-beta","0.1.2-beta","0.2.0-beta","0.2.1-beta","bentoml-release-v0.3.3","bentoml-release-v0.3.4","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.4.5","v0.4.6","v0.4.7","v0.4.8","v0.4.9","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.5.5","v0.5.6","v0.5.7","v0.5.8","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.4","v0.7.5","v0.7.7","v0.7.8","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.8.4","v0.8.5","v0.8.6","v0.9.0","v0.9.0.pre","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-a1","v1.0.0-a2","v1.0.0-a3","v1.0.0-a4","v1.0.0-a5","v1.0.0-a6","v1.0.0-a7","v1.0.0-rc0","v1.0.0-rc1","v1.0.0-rc2","v1.0.0-rc3","v1.0.0rc2","v1.0.10","v1.0.11","v1.0.12","v1.0.13","v1.0.14","v1.0.15","v1.0.16","v1.0.17","v1.0.18","v1.0.19","v1.0.2","v1.0.20","v1.0.21","v1.0.22","v1.0.23","v1.0.24","v1.0.25","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v1.0.7","v1.0.8","v1.0.9","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.10","v1.1.11","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.1.7","v1.1.8","v1.1.9","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.10","v1.2.11","v1.2.12","v1.2.13","v1.2.14","v1.2.15","v1.2.16","v1.2.17","v1.2.18","v1.2.19","v1.2.1a1","v1.2.2","v1.2.20","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.2.9","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.10","v1.3.11","v1.3.12","v1.3.13","v1.3.14","v1.3.15","v1.3.16","v1.3.17","v1.3.18","v1.3.19","v1.3.2","v1.3.20","v1.3.21","v1.3.22","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.4post1","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.3.7","v1.3.8","v1.3.9","v1.4.0","v1.4.0a1","v1.4.0a2","v1.4.1","v1.4.10","v1.4.11","v1.4.12","v1.4.13","v1.4.14","v1.4.15","v1.4.16","v1.4.17","v1.4.18","v1.4.19","v1.4.2","v1.4.20","v1.4.21","v1.4.22","v1.4.23","v1.4.24","v1.4.25","v1.4.26","v1.4.27","v1.4.28","v1.4.29","v1.4.3","v1.4.30","v1.4.31","v1.4.32","v1.4.33","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.4.6","v1.4.7","v1.4.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24123.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24123.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/commit/84d08cfeb40c5f2ce71b3d3444bbaa0fb16b5ca4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/releases/tag/v1.4.34"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/security/advisories/GHSA-6r62-w2q3-48hf"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24123"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-22"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24123.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
