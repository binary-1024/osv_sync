As opposed to centralized version control systems with a client-server model, Git ensures that each working copy of a Git repository is an exact copy with complete revision history. This not only allows the user to work on and contribute to projects without the need to have permission to push the changes to their official repositories, but also makes it possible for the user to work with no network connection.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* git: Git does not sanitize URLs when asking for credentials interactively (CVE-2024-50349)\n\n* git: Newline confusion in credential helpers can lead to credential exfiltration in git (CVE-2024-52006)\n\n* git: Git arbitrary code execution (CVE-2025-48384)\n\n* git: Git arbitrary file writes (CVE-2025-48385)\n\n* gitk: Git file creation flaw (CVE-2025-27613)\n\n* gitk: git script execution flaw (CVE-2025-27614)\n\n* git: Git GUI can create and overwrite files for which the user has write permission (CVE-2025-46835)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"git","ecosystem":"Rocky Linux:9","purl":"pkg:rpm/rocky-linux/git?distro=rocky-linux-9-6&epoch=0"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0:2.47.3-1.el9_6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/resf-osv-data/RLSA-2025:11462.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://errata.rockylinux.org/RLSA-2025:11462"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2337824"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2337956"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2378806"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2378808"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2379124"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2379125"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2379326"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L"}],"credits":[{"name":"Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation"},{"name":"Red Hat"}]}
