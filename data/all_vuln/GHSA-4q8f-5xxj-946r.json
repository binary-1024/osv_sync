  "details": "Versions of `addax` prior to 1.1.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package does not validate user input on the `presignPath` function which receives input directly from the API endpoint. Exploiting the vulnerability requires authentication. This may allow attackers to run arbitrary commands in the system.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 1.1.0 or later.",
