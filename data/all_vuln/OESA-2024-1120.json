  "details": "Initial UEFI bootloader that handles chaining to a trusted full \\ bootloader under secure boot environments.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA remote code execution vulnerability was found in Shim. The Shim boot support trusts attacker-controlled values when parsing an HTTP response. This flaw allows an attacker to craft a specific malicious HTTP request, leading to a completely controlled out-of-bounds write primitive and complete system compromise.(CVE-2023-40547)\r\n\r\nA buffer overflow was found in Shim in the 32-bit system. The overflow happens due to an addition operation involving a user-controlled value parsed from the PE binary being used by Shim. This value is further used for memory allocation operations, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. This flaw causes memory corruption and can lead to a crash or data integrity issues during the boot phase.(CVE-2023-40548)\r\n\r\nAn out-of-bounds read flaw was found in Shim due to the lack of proper boundary verification during the load of a PE binary. This flaw allows an attacker to load a crafted PE binary, triggering the issue and crashing Shim, resulting in a denial of service.(CVE-2023-40549)\r\n\r\nAn out-of-bounds read flaw was found in Shim when it tried to validate the SBAT information. This issue may expose sensitive data during the system&apos;s boot phase.(CVE-2023-40550)\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in the MZ binary format in Shim. An out-of-bounds read may occur, leading to a crash or possible exposure of sensitive data during the system&apos;s boot phase.(CVE-2023-40551)",
