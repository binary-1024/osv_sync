  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbinfmt_elf_fdpic: fix AUXV size calculation when ELF_HWCAP2 is defined\n\ncreate_elf_fdpic_tables() does not correctly account the space for the\nAUX vector when an architecture has ELF_HWCAP2 defined. Prior to the\ncommit 10e29251be0e (\"binfmt_elf_fdpic: fix /proc/<pid>/auxv\") it\nresulted in the last entry of the AUX vector being set to zero, but with\nthat change it results in a kernel BUG.\n\nFix that by adding one to the number of AUXV entries (nitems) when\nELF_HWCAP2 is defined.",
