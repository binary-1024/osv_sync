It provides a simple C language application programming interface (API) to access the secure communications protocols as well as APIs to parse and write X.509, PKCS #12, and other required structures. The project strives to provide a secure communications back-end, simple to use and integrated with the rest of the base Linux libraries. A back-end designed to work and be secure out of the box, keeping the complexity of TLS and PKI out of application code.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nA vulnerability was found in GnuTLS. The response times to malformed ciphertexts in RSA-PSK ClientKeyExchange differ from response times of ciphertexts with correct PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. This issue may allow a remote attacker to perform a timing side-channel attack in the RSA-PSK key exchange, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive data.
