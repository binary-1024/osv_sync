This worked by accident as the remaining COMP_EMPTY() platform entry became the codec entry, and the platform entry became completely empty, effectively the same as COMP_DUMMY() since snd_soc_fill_dummy_dai() doesn't do anything for platform entries.  This causes a KASAN out-of-bounds warning in mtk_soundcard_common_probe() in sound/soc/mediatek/common/mtk-soundcard-driver.c:  \tfor_each_card_prelinks(card, i, dai_link) { \t\tif (adsp_node && !strncmp(dai_link->name, \"AFE_SOF\", strlen(\"AFE_SOF\"))) \t\t\tdai_link->platforms->of_node = adsp_node; \t\telse if (!dai_link->platforms->name && !dai_link->platforms->of_node) \t\t\tdai_link->platforms->of_node = platform_node; \t}  where the code expects the platforms array to have space for at least one entry.  Add an COMP_EMPTY() entry so that dai_link->platforms has space.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.9.8-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-42088.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.9.8-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-42088.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-42088"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
