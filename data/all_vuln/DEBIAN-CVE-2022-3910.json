{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2022-3910","published":"2022-11-22T13:15:13Z","modified":"2025-09-30T03:54:29Z","upstream":["CVE-2022-3910"],"details":"Use After Free vulnerability in Linux Kernel allows Privilege Escalation. An improper Update of Reference Count in io_uring leads to Use-After-Free and Local Privilege Escalation. When io_msg_ring was invoked with a fixed file, it called io_fput_file() which improperly decreased its reference count (leading to Use-After-Free and Local Privilege Escalation). Fixed files are permanently registered to the ring, and should not be put separately.
