'n' here is the number of items in this block, which in this case was 1, but we had 2 REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING operations.  The actual root cause of this was that we were replaying operations for a block that shouldn't have been replayed.  Consider the following sequence of events  1. We have an already modified root, and we do a btrfs_get_tree_mod_seq(). 2. We begin removing items from this root, triggering KEY_REPLACE for    it's child slots. 3. We remove one of the 2 children this root node points to, thus triggering    the root node promotion of the remaining child, and freeing this node. 4. We modify a new root, and re-allocate the above node to the root node of    this other root.  The tree mod log looks something like this  \tlogical 0\top KEY_REPLACE (slot 1)\t\t\tseq 2 \tlogical 0\top KEY_REMOVE (slot 1)\t\t\tseq 3 \tlogical 0\top KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING (slot 0)\tseq 4 \tlogical 4096\top LOG_ROOT_REPLACE (old logical 0)\tseq 5 \tlogical 8192\top KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING (slot 1)\tseq 6 \tlogical 8192\top KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING (slot 0)\tseq 7 \tlogical 0\top LOG_ROOT_REPLACE (old logical 8192)\tseq 8  >From here the bug is triggered by the following steps  1.  Call btrfs_get_old_root() on the new_root. 2.  We call tree_mod_log_oldest_root(btrfs_root_node(new_root)), which is     currently logical 0. 3.  tree_mod_log_oldest_root() calls tree_mod_log_search_oldest(), which     gives us the KEY_REPLACE seq 2, and since that's not a     LOG_ROOT_REPLACE we incorrectly believe that we don't have an old     root, because we expect that the most recent change should be a     LOG_ROOT_REPLACE. 4.  Back in tree_mod_log_oldest_root() we don't have a LOG_ROOT_REPLACE,     so we don't set old_root, we simply use our e
