In version 1.6.5 and prior, cache-backed state/request-token storage is not tied to the initiating user session, so CSRF is possible for any attacker that has a valid state (easily obtainable via an attacker-initiated authentication flow). When a cache is supplied to the OAuth client registry, FrameworkIntegration.set_state_data writes the entire state blob under _state_{app}_{state}, and get_state_data ignores the caller’s session altogether. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.6.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-authlib","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-authlib?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.15.4-1","0.15.4-1+deb11u1","0.15.4-2","0.15.5-1","1.0.0-1","1.0.1-1","1.1.0-1","1.1.0-2","1.2.0-1","1.2.1-1","1.3.0-1","1.3.0-2","1.3.0-3","1.3.1-1","1.3.2-1","1.3.2-2","1.4.0-1","1.4.1-1","1.5.0-1","1.5.1-1","1.5.2-1","1.6.0-1","1.6.1-1","1.6.3-1","1.6.4-1","1.6.5-1","1.6.6-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68158.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-authlib","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-authlib?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.2.0-1","1.2.1-1","1.3.0-1","1.3.0-2","1.3.0-3","1.3.1-1","1.3.2-1","1.3.2-2","1.4.0-1","1.4.1-1","1.5.0-1","1.5.1-1","1.5.2-1","1.6.0-1","1.6.1-1","1.6.3-1","1.6.4-1","1.6.5-1","1.6.6-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68158.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-authlib","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-authlib?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["1.6.0-1","1.6.1-1","1.6.3-1","1.6.4-1","1.6.5-1","1.6.6-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68158.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-authlib","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-authlib?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.6.6-1"}]}],"versions":["1.6.0-1","1.6.1-1","1.6.3-1","1.6.4-1","1.6.5-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68158.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-68158"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
