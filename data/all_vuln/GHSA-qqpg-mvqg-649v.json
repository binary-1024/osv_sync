In addition, the attacker must  have write access to a configuration file. However, after successful instantiation, the instance is very likely to be discarded with no further ado.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ch.qos.logback:logback-core","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/ch.qos.logback/logback-core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.25"}]}],"versions":["0.2.5","0.3","0.5","0.6","0.7","0.7.1","0.8","0.8.1","0.9","0.9.1","0.9.10","0.9.11","0.9.12","0.9.13","0.9.14","0.9.15","0.9.16","0.9.17","0.9.18","0.9.19","0.9.2","0.9.20","0.9.21","0.9.22","0.9.23","0.9.24","0.9.25","0.9.26","0.9.27","0.9.28","0.9.29","0.9.3","0.9.30","0.9.4","0.9.5","0.9.6","0.9.7","0.9.8","0.9.9","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.10","1.0.11","1.0.12","1.0.13","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.0.7","1.0.8","1.0.9","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.10","1.1.11","1.1.2","1.1.3","1.1.4","1.1.5","1.1.6","1.1.7","1.1.8","1.1.9","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.10","1.2.11","1.2.12","1.2.13","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.2.4","1.2.4-groovyless","1.2.5","1.2.6","1.2.7","1.2.8","1.2.9","1.3.0","1.3.0-alpha0","1.3.0-alpha1","1.3.0-alpha10","1.3.0-alpha11","1.3.0-alpha12","1.3.0-alpha13","1.3.0-alpha14","1.3.0-alpha15","1.3.0-alpha16","1.3.0-alpha2","1.3.0-alpha3","1.3.0-alpha4","1.3.0-alpha5","1.3.0-alpha6","1.3.0-alpha7","1.3.0-alpha8","1.3.0-alpha9","1.3.0-beta0","1.3.1","1.3.10","1.3.11","1.3.12","1.3.13","1.3.14","1.3.15","1.3.16","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.3.4","1.3.5","1.3.6","1.3.7","1.3.8","1.3.9","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.10","1.4.11","1.4.12","1.4.13","1.4.14","1.4.2","1.4.3","1.4.4","1.4.5","1.4.6","1.4.7","1.4.8","1.4.9","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.5.10","1.5.11","1.5.12","1.5.13","1.5.14","1.5.15","1.5.16","1.5.17","1.5.18","1.5.19","1.5.2","1.5.20","1.5.21","1.5.22","1.5.23","1.5.24","1.5.3","1.5.4","1.5.5","1.5.6","1.5.7","1.5.8","1.5.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-qqpg-mvqg-649v/GHSA-qqpg-mvqg-649v.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-1225"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/issues/997"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/commit/1f97ae1844b1be8486e4e9cade98d7123d3eded5"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/qos-ch/logback"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://logback.qos.ch/news.html#1.5.25"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-22T18:06:44Z","nvd_published_at":"2026-01-22T10:16:07Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:P/PR:H/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:L/SI:L/SA:L"}]}
