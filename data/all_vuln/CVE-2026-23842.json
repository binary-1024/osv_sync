{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-23842","published":"2026-01-19T18:39:37.059Z","modified":"2026-01-28T05:45:56.324261Z","aliases":["GHSA-v4w8-49pv-mf72"],"summary":"ChatterBot has Denial of Service via Database Connection Pool Exhaustion","details":"ChatterBot is a machine learning, conversational dialog engine for creating chat bots. ChatterBot versions up to 1.2.10 are vulnerable to a denial-of-service condition caused by improper database session and connection pool management. Concurrent invocations of the get_response() method can exhaust the underlying SQLAlchemy connection pool, resulting in persistent service unavailability and requiring a manual restart to recover. Version 1.2.11 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/gunthercox/chatterbot","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"97181bde5546d112ef95eafda390aada68251d87"}]}],"versions":["0.0.0","0.0.1","0.0.2","0.0.3","0.0.4","0.0.5","0.1.0","0.1.1","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.2.2","0.2.3","0.2.4","0.2.5","0.2.6","0.2.7","0.2.8","0.2.9","0.3.0","0.3.1","0.3.2","0.3.3","0.3.4","0.3.5","0.3.6","0.3.7","0.4.0","0.4.1","0.4.10","0.4.11","0.4.12","0.4.13","0.4.14","0.4.2","0.4.3","0.4.4","0.4.5","0.4.6","0.4.7","0.4.8","0.4.9","0.5.0","0.5.1","0.5.2","0.5.3","0.5.4","0.5.5","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.6.2","0.6.3","0.7.0","0.7.1","0.7.2","0.7.3","0.7.4","0.7.5","0.7.6","0.8.0","0.8.1","0.8.2","0.8.3","0.8.4","0.8.5","0.8.6","0.8.7","1.0.0","1.0.0a1","1.0.0a2","1.0.0a3","1.0.0a4","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.1.0a1","1.1.0a2","1.1.0a3","1.1.0a4","1.1.0a5","1.1.0a6","1.1.0a7","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.10","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.2.4","1.2.5","1.2.6","1.2.7","1.2.8","1.2.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23842.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23842.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot/commit/de89fe648139f8eeacc998ad4524fab291a378cf"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot/pull/2432"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot/releases/tag/1.2.11"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot/security/advisories/GHSA-v4w8-49pv-mf72"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ee845c4-b847-4854-84ec-4b2fb2f7090f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23842"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-400"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23842.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
