In versions 1.4.3 and below, the entry implementation can panic on attacker-controlled input when canonicalizing a proposed entry with an empty spec.message, causing nil Pointer Dereference. Function validate() returns nil (success) when message is empty, leaving sign1Msg uninitialized, and Canonicalize() later dereferences v.sign1Msg.Payload. A malformed proposed entry of the cose/v0.0.1 type can cause a panic on a thread within the Rekor process. The thread is recovered so the client receives a 500 error message and service still continues, so the availability impact of this is minimal. This issue has been fixed in version 1.5.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/sigstore/rekor","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"fe9717fd6ee4cfecedc30e5fd64c9872bc2ac61c"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v1.0-rc","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-rc.1","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.10","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.3.7","v1.3.8","v1.3.9","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23831.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23831.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/commit/39bae3d192bce48ef4ef2cbd1788fb5770fee8cd"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/releases/tag/v1.5.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/security/advisories/GHSA-273p-m2cw-6833"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23831"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-476"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23831.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
