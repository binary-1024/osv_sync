An attacker must have physical access to the computer system and requires a crafted USB device or smart card to present the system with specially crafted responses to the APDUs, which are considered high complexity and low severity. This manipulation can allow for compromised card management operations during enrolment.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"opensc","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/opensc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.21.0-1+deb11u1"}]}],"versions":["0.21.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-1454.json"}},{"package":{"name":"opensc","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/opensc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.23.0-0.3+deb12u2"}]}],"versions":["0.23.0-0.3","0.23.0-0.3+deb12u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-1454.json"}},{"package":{"name":"opensc","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/opensc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.25.0~rc1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-1454.json"}},{"package":{"name":"opensc","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/opensc?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.25.0~rc1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-1454.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-1454"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
