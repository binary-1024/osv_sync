  "details": "### Impact\nIn the npm package named \"slp-validate\", versions prior to 1.2.2 are vulnerable to false-positive validation outcomes for the NFT1 Child Genesis transaction type. A poorly implemented SLP wallet or opportunistic attacker could create a seemingly valid NFT1 child token without burning any of the NFT1 Group token type as is required by the NFT1 specification.\n\n### Patches\nnpm package \"slp-validate\" has been patched and is published and tagged as version 1.2.2.\n\n### Workarounds\nUpgrade to slp-validate 1.2.2.\n\n### References\n* Package location: https://www.npmjs.com/package/slp-validate\n* SLP NFT1 spec: https://slp.dev/specs/slp-nft-1/#nft1-protocol-requirements\n* Git commit hash fixing this issue: https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-validate.js/commit/3963cf914afae69084059b82483da916d97af65c\n* Unit tests have been added to assist validator implementations in avoiding this bug: https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-unit-test-data/commit/8c942eacfae12686dcf1f3366321445a4fba73e7\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory please open an issue in the [slp-validate](https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-validate.js/issues) repository.",
