From version 1.6.0 to before 1.6.51, a heap buffer over-read vulnerability exists in libpng's png_write_image_8bit function when processing 8-bit images through the simplified write API with convert_to_8bit enabled. The vulnerability affects 8-bit grayscale+alpha, RGB/RGBA, and images with incomplete row data. A conditional guard incorrectly allows 8-bit input to enter code expecting 16-bit input, causing reads up to 2 bytes beyond allocated buffer boundaries. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.51.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libpng_jll","ecosystem":"Julia","purl":"pkg:julia/libpng_jll?uuid=b53b4c65-9356-5827-b1ea-8c7a1a84506f"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.6.51+0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/SecurityAdvisories.jl/tree/generated/osv/2025/JLSEC-2025-329.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/commit/2bd84c019c300b78e811743fbcddb67c9d9bf821"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/pull/749"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/security/advisories/GHSA-qpr4-xm66-hww6"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC-BY-4.0","sources":[{"html_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64506","id":"CVE-2025-64506","imported":"2025-11-27T03:28:04.930Z","modified":"2025-11-26T18:34:38.240Z","published":"2025-11-25T00:15:47.300Z","url":"https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2025-64506"}]}}
