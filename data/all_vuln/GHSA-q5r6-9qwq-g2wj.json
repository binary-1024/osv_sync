An issue exists where, under certain circumstances, the library could an infinite loop, resulting in denial of service. As of August 20, 2025, this library has been deprecated and will not receive further updates.\n\n### Impact\nAn infinite loop issue in Amazon.IonDotnet library versions <v1.3.2 may allow a threat actor to cause a denial of service through a specially crafted text input.

We recommend upgrading to the latest version and ensuring any forked or derivative code is patched to incorporate the new fixes.\n\n### Workarounds\nOnly accept data from trusted sources, written using a supported Ion library.\n\n### References\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, we ask that you contact AWS Security via our [vulnerability reporting page](https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting) or directly via email to [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).
