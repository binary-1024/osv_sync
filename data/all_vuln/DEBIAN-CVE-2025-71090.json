{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-71090","published":"2026-01-13T16:16:08.700Z","modified":"2026-01-14T11:11:06.045650Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-71090"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfsd: fix nfsd_file reference leak in nfsd4_add_rdaccess_to_wrdeleg()  nfsd4_add_rdaccess_to_wrdeleg() unconditionally overwrites fp->fi_fds[O_RDONLY] with a newly acquired nfsd_file. However, if the client already has a SHARE_ACCESS_READ open from a previous OPEN operation, this action overwrites the existing pointer without releasing its reference, orphaning the previous reference.  Additionally, the function originally stored the same nfsd_file pointer in both fp->fi_fds[O_RDONLY] and fp->fi_rdeleg_file with only a single reference. When put_deleg_file() runs, it clears fi_rdeleg_file and calls nfs4_file_put_access() to release the file.  However, nfs4_file_put_access() only releases fi_fds[O_RDONLY] when the fi_access[O_RDONLY] counter drops to zero. If another READ open exists on the file, the counter remains elevated and the nfsd_file reference from the delegation is never released. This potentially causes open conflicts on that file.  Then, on server shutdown, these leaks cause __nfsd_file_cache_purge() to encounter files with an elevated reference count that cannot be cleaned up, ultimately triggering a BUG() in kmem_cache_destroy() because there are still nfsd_file objects allocated in that cache.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["6.12.38-1","6.12.41-1","6.12.43-1","6.12.43-1~bpo12+1","6.12.48-1","6.12.57-1","6.12.57-1~bpo12+1","6.12.63-1","6.13.10-1~exp1","6.13.11-1~exp1","6.13.2-1~exp1","6.13.3-1~exp1","6.13.4-1~exp1","6.13.5-1~exp1","6.13.6-1~exp1","6.13.7-1~exp1","6.13.8-1~exp1","6.13.9-1~exp1","6.13~rc6-1~exp1","6.13~rc7-1~exp1","6.14.3-1~exp1","6.14.5-1~exp1","6.14.6-1~exp1","6.15-1~exp1","6.15.1-1~exp1","6.15.2-1~exp1","6.15.3-1~exp1","6.15.4-1~exp1","6.15.5-1~exp1","6.15.6-1~exp1","6.15~rc7-1~exp1","6.16-1~exp1","6.16.1-1~exp1","6.16.10-1","6.16.11-1","6.16.12-1","6.16.12-1~bpo13+1","6.16.12-2","6.16.3-1","6.16.3-1~bpo13+1","6.16.5-1","6.16.6-1","6.16.7-1","6.16.8-1","6.16.9-1","6.16~rc7-1~exp1","6.17.10-1","6.17.11-1","6.17.12-1","6.17.13-1","6.17.13-1~bpo13+1","6.17.2-1~exp1","6.17.5-1~exp1","6.17.6-1","6.17.7-1","6.17.7-2","6.17.8-1","6.17.8-1~bpo13+1","6.17.9-1","6.18.1-1~exp1","6.18.2-1~exp1","6.18.3-1","6.18~rc4-1~exp1","6.18~rc4-1~exp2","6.18~rc5-1~exp1","6.18~rc6-1~exp1","6.18~rc7-1~exp1","6.19~rc4-1~exp1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-71090.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-71090"}]}
