Applications using `werkzeug.formparser.MultiPartParser` corresponding to a version of Werkzeug prior to 3.0.6 to parse `multipart/form-data` requests (e.g. all flask applications) are vulnerable to a relatively simple but effective resource exhaustion (denial of service) attack. A specifically crafted form submission request can cause the parser to allocate and block 3 to 8 times the upload size in main memory. There is no upper limit; a single upload at 1 Gbit/s can exhaust 32 GB of RAM in less than 60 seconds. Werkzeug version 3.0.6 fixes this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"py3-werkzeug","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.23","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/py3-werkzeug?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.0.6-r0"}]}],"versions":["0.11.11-r0","0.11.15-r0","0.11.15-r1","0.11.15-r2","0.14.1-r0","0.14.1-r1","0.14.1-r2","0.14.1-r3","0.15.2-r0","0.16.1-r0","0.8.3-r0","0.9.4-r0","0.9.5-r0","0.9.6-r0","1.0.1-r0","1.0.1-r1","1.0.1-r2","2.0.0-r0","2.0.1-r0","2.0.2-r0","2.0.2-r1","2.0.3-r0","2.2.2-r0","2.2.2-r1","2.2.2-r2","2.2.3-r0","2.2.3-r1","2.3.6-r0","2.3.7-r0","2.3.7-r1","2.3.8-r0","3.0.1-r0","3.0.1-r1","3.0.2-r0","3.0.3-r0","3.0.4-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-49767.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2024-49767"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
