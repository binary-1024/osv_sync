  "details": "NTFS-3G is a stable, open source, GPL licensed, POSIX, read/write NTFS driver for Linux and many other operating systems. It provides safe handling of the Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows 2000, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 and Windows 7 NTFS file systems.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nIn NTFS-3G versions &lt; 2021.8.22, when a specially crafted NTFS attribute is supplied to the function ntfs_get_attribute_value, a heap buffer overflow can occur allowing for memory disclosure or denial of service. The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bound buffer access which can be triggered by mounting a crafted ntfs partition. The root cause is a missing consistency check after reading an MFT record : the &quot;bytes_in_use&quot; field should be less than the &quot;bytes_allocated&quot; field. When it is not, the parsing of the records proceeds into the wild.(CVE-2021-33285)\r\n\r\nA crafted NTFS image can cause an out-of-bounds read in ntfs_ie_lookup in NTFS-3G &lt; 2021.8.22.(CVE-2021-39252)\r\n\r\nA crafted NTFS image can trigger an out-of-bounds read, caused by an invalid attribute in ntfs_attr_find_in_attrdef, in NTFS-3G &lt; 2021.8.22.(CVE-2021-39255)\r\n\r\nIn NTFS-3G versions &lt; 2021.8.22, when a specially crafted MFT section is supplied in an NTFS image a heap buffer overflow can occur and allow for code execution.(CVE-2021-33289)\r\n\r\nIn NTFS-3G versions &lt; 2021.8.22, when a specially crafted unicode string is supplied in an NTFS image a heap buffer overflow can occur and allow for code execution.(CVE-2021-33286)\r\n\r\nNTFS-3G versions &lt; 2021.8.22, when a specially crafted NTFS attribute from the MFT is setup in the function ntfs_attr_setup_flag, a heap buffer overflow can occur allowing for code execution and escalation of privileges.(CVE-2021-35269)\r\n\r\nA crafted NTFS image can cause a heap-based buffer overflow in ntfs_compressed_pwrite in NTFS-3G &lt; 2021.8.22.(CVE-2021-39261)\r\n\r\nA crafted NTFS image can trigger a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by an unsanitized attribute in ntfs_get_attribute_value, in NTFS-3G &lt; 2021.8.22.(CVE-2021-39263)\r\n\r\nA crafted NTFS image can cause an out-of-bounds access in ntfs_decompress in NTFS-3G &lt; 2021.8.22.(CVE-2021-39262)\r\n\r\nA crafted NTFS image can cause an out-of-bounds access in ntfs_inode_sync_standard_information in NTFS-3G &lt; 2021.8.22.(CVE-2021-39260)\r\n\r\nA crafted NTFS image can trigger an out-of-bounds access, caused by an unsanitized attribute length in ntfs_inode_lookup_by_name, in NTFS-3G &lt; 2021.8.22.(CVE-2021-39259)\r\n\r\nIn NTFS-3G versions &lt; 2021.8.22, when a specially crafted NTFS inode is loaded in the function ntfs_inode_real_open, a heap buffer overflow can occur allowing for code execution and escalation of privileges.(CVE-2021-35268)\r\n\r\nA crafted NTFS image can cause a heap-based buffer overflow in ntfs_inode_lookup_by_name in NTFS-3G &lt; 2021.8.22.(CVE-2021-39256)\r\n\r\nA crafted NTFS image can cause an out-of-bounds read in ntfs_runlists_merge_i in NTFS-3G &lt; 2021.8.22.(CVE-2021-39253)\r\n\r\nIn NTFS-3G versions &lt; 2021.8.22, when a specially crafted NTFS inode pathname is supplied in an NTFS image a heap buffer overflow can occur resulting in memory disclosure, denial of service and even code execution.(CVE-2021-35266)\r\n\r\nA crafted NTFS image can cause out-of-bounds reads in ntfs_attr_find and ntfs_external_attr_find in NTFS-3G &lt; 2021.8.22.(CVE-2021-39258)\r\n\r\nIn NTFS-3G versions &lt; 2021.8.22, when specially crafted NTFS attributes are read in the function ntfs_attr_pread_i, a heap buffer overflow can occur and allow for writing to arbitrary memory or denial of service of the application.(CVE-2021-33287)\r\n\r\nA crafted NTFS image can cause an integer overflow in memmove, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow in the function ntfs_attr_record_resize, in NTFS-3G &lt; 2021.8.22.(CVE-2021-39254)\r\n\r\nNTFS-3G versions &lt; 2021.8.22, a stack buffer overflow can occur when correcting differences in the MFT and MFTMirror allowing for code execution or escalation of privileges when setuid-root.(CVE-2021-35267)\r\n\r\nA crafted NTFS image with an unallocated bitmap can lead to a endless recursive function call chain (starting from ntfs_attr_pwrite), causing stack consumption in NTFS-3G &lt; 2021.8.22.(CVE-2021-39257)\r\n\r\nA crafted NTFS image can cause a NULL pointer dereference in ntfs_extent_inode_open in NTFS-3G &lt; 2021.8.22.(CVE-2021-39251)",
