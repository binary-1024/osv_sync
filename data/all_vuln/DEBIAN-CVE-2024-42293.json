In this configuration, the generic implementation of p4d_offset_lockless() will return a 'p4d_t *' corresponding to the 'pgd_t' allocated on the stack of the caller, gup_fast_pgd_range(). This is normally fine, but when the fourth level of page-table is folded at runtime, pud_offset_lockless() will offset from the address of the 'p4d_t' to calculate the address of the PUD in the same page-table page. This results in a stray stack read when the 'p4d_t' has been allocated on the stack and can send the walker into the weeds.  Fix the problem by providing our own definition of p4d_offset_lockless() when CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS <= 4 which returns the real page-table pointer rather than the address of the local stack variable.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.10.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-42293.json"}},{"package":{"name":"linux","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.10.3-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-42293.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-42293"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
