{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-21874","published":"2026-01-08T09:50:47.247Z","modified":"2026-01-13T20:11:01.434900Z","aliases":["GHSA-mp55-g7pj-rvm2"],"summary":"NiceGUI has Redis connection leak via tab storage causes service degradation","details":"NiceGUI is a Python-based UI framework. From versions v2.10.0 to 3.4.1, an unauthenticated attacker can exhaust Redis connections by repeatedly opening and closing browser tabs on any NiceGUI application using Redis-backed storage. Connections are never released, leading to service degradation when Redis hits its connection limit. NiceGUI continues accepting new connections - errors are logged but the app stays up with broken storage functionality. This issue has been patched in version 3.5.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui","events":[{"introduced":"ac7929d946ae6f8cdce2b2a7a94c13b9972b4a75"},{"fixed":"ae20f775a683fdf8643cb8cbb35d14279b866af6"}]}],"versions":["v2.10.0","v2.10.1","v2.11.0","v2.11.1","v2.12.0","v2.12.1","v2.13.0","v2.14.0","v2.14.1","v2.15.0","v2.16.0","v2.16.1","v2.17.0","v2.18.0","v2.19.0","v2.20.0","v2.21.0","v2.21.1","v2.22.0","v2.22.1","v2.22.2","v2.23.0","v2.23.1","v2.23.2","v2.23.3","v2.24.0","v2.24.1","v2.24.2","v3.0.0","v3.0.0rc1","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.1.0","v3.2.0","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.4.0","v3.4.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-21874.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/21xxx/CVE-2026-21874.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/commit/6c52eb2c90c4b67387c025b29646b4bc1578eb83"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/releases/tag/v3.5.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/security/advisories/GHSA-mp55-g7pj-rvm2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-21874"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-772"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/21xxx/CVE-2026-21874.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
