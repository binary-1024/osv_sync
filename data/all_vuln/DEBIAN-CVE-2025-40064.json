{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-40064","published":"2025-10-28T12:15:40Z","modified":"2025-10-29T09:03:53.300884Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-40064"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smc: Fix use-after-free in __pnet_find_base_ndev().  syzbot reported use-after-free of net_device in __pnet_find_base_ndev(), which was called during connect(). [0]  smc_pnet_find_ism_resource() fetches sk_dst_get(sk)->dev and passes down to pnet_find_base_ndev(), where RTNL is held.  Then, UAF happened at __pnet_find_base_ndev() when the dev is first used.  This means dev had already been freed before acquiring RTNL in pnet_find_base_ndev().  While dev is going away, dst->dev could be swapped with blackhole_netdev, and the dev's refcnt by dst will be released.  We must hold dev's refcnt before calling smc_pnet_find_ism_resource().  Also, smc_pnet_find_roce_resource() has the same problem.  Let's use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu() in the two functions.
