  "details": "It was found that RPM wrote file contents to the target installation\ndirectory under a temporary name, and verified its cryptographic signature\nonly after the temporary file has been written completely. Under certain\nconditions, the system interprets the unverified temporary file contents\nand extracts commands from it. This could allow an attacker to modify\nsigned RPM files in such a way that they would execute code chosen by the\nattacker during package installation (CVE-2013-6435).\n\nIt was found that RPM could encounter an integer overflow, leading to a\nstack-based buffer overflow, while parsing a crafted CPIO header in the\npayload section of an RPM file. This could allow an attacker to modify\nsigned RPM files in such a way that they would execute code chosen by the\nattacker during package installation (CVE-2014-8118).\n",
