{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2024-12747","published":"2025-01-14T18:15:25Z","modified":"2025-10-14T04:22:32.813490Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-12747"],"details":"A flaw was found in rsync. This vulnerability arises from a race condition during rsync's handling of symbolic links. Rsync's default behavior when encountering symbolic links is to skip them. If an attacker replaced a regular file with a symbolic link at the right time, it was possible to bypass the default behavior and traverse symbolic links. Depending on the privileges of the rsync process, an attacker could leak sensitive information, potentially leading to privilege escalation.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.4.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6","3.1.2-r7","3.1.3-r0","3.1.3-r1","3.1.3-r2","3.1.3-r3","3.2.2-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.3-r1","3.2.3-r2","3.2.3-r3","3.2.3-r4","3.2.3-r5","3.2.4-r0","3.2.4-r1","3.2.4-r2","3.2.5-r0","3.2.6-r0","3.2.7-r0","3.2.7-r1","3.2.7-r2","3.2.7-r3","3.2.7-r4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-12747.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.4.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6","3.1.2-r7","3.1.3-r0","3.1.3-r1","3.1.3-r2","3.1.3-r3","3.2.2-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.3-r1","3.2.3-r2","3.2.3-r3","3.2.3-r4","3.2.3-r5","3.2.4-r0","3.2.4-r1","3.2.4-r2","3.2.5-r0","3.2.6-r0","3.2.7-r0","3.2.7-r1","3.2.7-r2","3.2.7-r3","3.2.7-r4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-12747.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.4.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6","3.1.2-r7","3.1.3-r0","3.1.3-r1","3.1.3-r2","3.1.3-r3","3.2.2-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.3-r1","3.2.3-r2","3.2.3-r3","3.2.3-r4","3.2.3-r5","3.2.4-r0","3.2.4-r1","3.2.4-r2","3.2.5-r0","3.2.6-r0","3.2.7-r0","3.2.7-r1","3.2.7-r2","3.2.7-r3","3.2.7-r4","3.3.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-12747.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.4.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6","3.1.2-r7","3.1.3-r0","3.1.3-r1","3.1.3-r2","3.1.3-r3","3.2.2-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.3-r1","3.2.3-r2","3.2.3-r3","3.2.3-r4","3.2.3-r5","3.2.4-r0","3.2.4-r1","3.2.4-r2","3.2.5-r0","3.2.6-r0","3.2.7-r0","3.2.7-r1","3.2.7-r2","3.2.7-r3","3.2.7-r4","3.3.0-r0","3.3.0-r1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-12747.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rsync","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/rsync?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.4.0-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.0.5-r0","3.0.6-r0","3.0.6-r1","3.0.7-r0","3.0.7-r1","3.0.8-r0","3.0.9-r0","3.0.9-r1","3.1.0-r0","3.1.1-r0","3.1.1-r1","3.1.1-r2","3.1.2-r2","3.1.2-r3","3.1.2-r4","3.1.2-r5","3.1.2-r6","3.1.2-r7","3.1.3-r0","3.1.3-r1","3.1.3-r2","3.1.3-r3","3.2.2-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.2.3-r1","3.2.3-r2","3.2.3-r3","3.2.3-r4","3.2.3-r5","3.2.4-r0","3.2.4-r1","3.2.4-r2","3.2.5-r0","3.2.6-r0","3.2.7-r0","3.2.7-r1","3.2.7-r2","3.2.7-r3","3.2.7-r4","3.3.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-12747.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2024-12747"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
