NOTE: a package maintainer disputes this issue, reporting that there is a proper check within the only code that uses the applicable part of crypto_drv.c, and thus \"this report is invalid.","references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=511520"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2009/01/12/4"}],"database_specific":{"isDisputed":true}}
