  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fscrypt: destroy keyring after security_sb_delete()  fscrypt_destroy_keyring() must be called after all potentially-encrypted inodes were evicted; otherwise it cannot safely destroy the keyring. Since inodes that are in-use by the Landlock LSM don't get evicted until security_sb_delete(), this means that fscrypt_destroy_keyring() must be called *after* security_sb_delete().  This fixes a WARN_ON followed by a NULL dereference, only possible if Landlock was being used on encrypted files.",
