If this binary is absent from the PATH, it will try running the LSP server binary in the directory of the file that was just opened (due to a misunderstanding of the QProcess API, that was never intended). This can be an untrusted directory.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kate","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/kate?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["4:20.12.2-1","4:21.04.0-1","4:21.04.1-1","4:21.04.2-1","4:21.04.3-1","4:21.08.0-1","4:21.08.0-2","4:21.08.1-1","4:21.08.2-1","4:21.12.2-1","4:21.12.3-1","4:22.04.1-1","4:22.04.3-1","4:22.12.0-1","4:22.12.0-2","4:22.12.1-1","4:22.12.2-1","4:22.12.3-1","4:23.08.1-1","4:24.05.2-1","4:24.08.0-1","4:24.08.0-2","4:24.08.2-1","4:24.08.2-2","4:24.08.2-3","4:24.08.2-4","4:24.08.2-5","4:24.12.0-1","4:24.12.1-1","4:24.12.3-1","4:24.12.3-2","4:25.03.90-1","4:25.04.0-1","4:25.04.2-1","4:25.04.3-1","4:25.04.3-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-23853.json"}},{"package":{"name":"kate","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/kate?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4:21.12.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-23853.json"}},{"package":{"name":"kate","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/kate?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4:21.12.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-23853.json"}},{"package":{"name":"kate","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/kate?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4:21.12.2-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-23853.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ktexteditor","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ktexteditor?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["5.100.0-1","5.101.0-1","5.101.0-2","5.102.0-1","5.102.0-2","5.103.0-1","5.103.0-1.1","5.104.0-1","5.107.0-1","5.115.0-1","5.115.0-2","5.115.0-3","5.116.0-1","5.78.0-3","5.79.0-1","5.80.0-1","5.81.0-1","5.82.0-1","5.83.0-1","5.83.0-2","5.83.0-3","5.85.0-1","5.85.0-2","5.85.0-3","5.86.0-1","5.88.0-1","5.90.0-1","5.90.0-2","5.93.0-1","5.93.0-2","5.94.0-1","5.94.0-2","5.94.0-3","5.94.0-4","5.96.0-1","5.97.0-1","5.98.0-1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-23853.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ktexteditor","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ktexteditor?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.93.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-23853.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ktexteditor","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ktexteditor?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.93.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-23853.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ktexteditor","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/ktexteditor?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.93.0-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2022-23853.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-23853"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
