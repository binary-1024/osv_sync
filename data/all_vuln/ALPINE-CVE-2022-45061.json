An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, and 3.7.16.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/python3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.9.16-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.1.3-r0","3.2.0-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.3.0-r0","3.3.2-r0","3.3.3-r0","3.3.4-r0","3.4.1-r0","3.4.2-r0","3.4.2-r1","3.4.3-r1","3.4.3-r2","3.5.0-r0","3.5.1-r0","3.5.1-r1","3.5.1-r2","3.5.1-r3","3.5.2-r0","3.5.2-r1","3.5.2-r10","3.5.2-r2","3.5.2-r3","3.5.2-r4","3.5.2-r5","3.5.2-r6","3.5.2-r7","3.5.2-r8","3.5.2-r9","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.1-r1","3.6.1-r2","3.6.1-r3","3.6.1-r4","3.6.2-r0","3.6.2-r1","3.6.2-r2","3.6.2-r3","3.6.3-r3","3.6.3-r4","3.6.3-r5","3.6.3-r6","3.6.3-r7","3.6.3-r8","3.6.3-r9","3.6.4-r0","3.6.4-r1","3.6.6-r0","3.6.6-r1","3.6.6-r2","3.6.6-r3","3.6.7-r0","3.6.8-r0","3.6.8-r1","3.6.8-r2","3.7.2-r0","3.7.3-r0","3.7.3-r1","3.7.4-r0","3.7.5-r0","3.7.5-r1","3.8.0-r0","3.8.1-r0","3.8.1-r1","3.8.1-r2","3.8.1-r3","3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.8.2-r5","3.8.2-r6","3.8.2-r7","3.8.3-r0","3.8.4-r0","3.8.5-r0","3.8.5-r1","3.8.5-r2","3.8.6-r0","3.8.7-r0","3.8.7-r1","3.8.7-r2","3.8.7-r3","3.8.8-r0","3.9.1-r0","3.9.15-r0","3.9.2-r0","3.9.4-r0","3.9.5-r0","3.9.5-r1","3.9.5-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-45061.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/python3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.9.16-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.1.3-r0","3.2.0-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.3.0-r0","3.3.2-r0","3.3.3-r0","3.3.4-r0","3.4.1-r0","3.4.2-r0","3.4.2-r1","3.4.3-r1","3.4.3-r2","3.5.0-r0","3.5.1-r0","3.5.1-r1","3.5.1-r2","3.5.1-r3","3.5.2-r0","3.5.2-r1","3.5.2-r10","3.5.2-r2","3.5.2-r3","3.5.2-r4","3.5.2-r5","3.5.2-r6","3.5.2-r7","3.5.2-r8","3.5.2-r9","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.1-r1","3.6.1-r2","3.6.1-r3","3.6.1-r4","3.6.2-r0","3.6.2-r1","3.6.2-r2","3.6.2-r3","3.6.3-r3","3.6.3-r4","3.6.3-r5","3.6.3-r6","3.6.3-r7","3.6.3-r8","3.6.3-r9","3.6.4-r0","3.6.4-r1","3.6.6-r0","3.6.6-r1","3.6.6-r2","3.6.6-r3","3.6.7-r0","3.6.8-r0","3.6.8-r1","3.6.8-r2","3.7.2-r0","3.7.3-r0","3.7.3-r1","3.7.4-r0","3.7.5-r0","3.7.5-r1","3.8.0-r0","3.8.1-r0","3.8.1-r1","3.8.1-r2","3.8.1-r3","3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.8.2-r5","3.8.2-r6","3.8.2-r7","3.8.3-r0","3.8.4-r0","3.8.5-r0","3.8.5-r1","3.8.5-r2","3.8.6-r0","3.8.7-r0","3.8.7-r1","3.8.7-r2","3.8.7-r3","3.8.8-r0","3.9.1-r0","3.9.13-r0","3.9.13-r1","3.9.15-r0","3.9.2-r0","3.9.4-r0","3.9.5-r0","3.9.5-r1","3.9.6-r0","3.9.6-r1","3.9.6-r2","3.9.7-r2","3.9.7-r3","3.9.7-r4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-45061.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/python3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.10.9-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.1.3-r0","3.10.0-r0","3.10.0-r1","3.10.1-r0","3.10.2-r0","3.10.2-r1","3.10.3-r0","3.10.3-r1","3.10.4-r0","3.10.5-r0","3.10.8-r0","3.2.0-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.3.0-r0","3.3.2-r0","3.3.3-r0","3.3.4-r0","3.4.1-r0","3.4.2-r0","3.4.2-r1","3.4.3-r1","3.4.3-r2","3.5.0-r0","3.5.1-r0","3.5.1-r1","3.5.1-r2","3.5.1-r3","3.5.2-r0","3.5.2-r1","3.5.2-r10","3.5.2-r2","3.5.2-r3","3.5.2-r4","3.5.2-r5","3.5.2-r6","3.5.2-r7","3.5.2-r8","3.5.2-r9","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.1-r1","3.6.1-r2","3.6.1-r3","3.6.1-r4","3.6.2-r0","3.6.2-r1","3.6.2-r2","3.6.2-r3","3.6.3-r3","3.6.3-r4","3.6.3-r5","3.6.3-r6","3.6.3-r7","3.6.3-r8","3.6.3-r9","3.6.4-r0","3.6.4-r1","3.6.6-r0","3.6.6-r1","3.6.6-r2","3.6.6-r3","3.6.7-r0","3.6.8-r0","3.6.8-r1","3.6.8-r2","3.7.2-r0","3.7.3-r0","3.7.3-r1","3.7.4-r0","3.7.5-r0","3.7.5-r1","3.8.0-r0","3.8.1-r0","3.8.1-r1","3.8.1-r2","3.8.1-r3","3.8.2-r0","3.8.2-r1","3.8.2-r2","3.8.2-r3","3.8.2-r4","3.8.2-r5","3.8.2-r6","3.8.2-r7","3.8.3-r0","3.8.4-r0","3.8.5-r0","3.8.5-r1","3.8.5-r2","3.8.6-r0","3.8.7-r0","3.8.7-r1","3.8.7-r2","3.8.7-r3","3.8.8-r0","3.9.1-r0","3.9.2-r0","3.9.4-r0","3.9.5-r0","3.9.5-r1","3.9.6-r0","3.9.6-r1","3.9.6-r2","3.9.7-r2","3.9.7-r3","3.9.7-r4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2022-45061.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python3","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/python3?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.10.9-r0"}]}],"versions":["3.1.3-r0","3.10.0-r0","3.10.0-r1","3.10.1-r0","3.10.2-r0","3.10.2-r1","3.10.3-r0","3.10.3-r1","3.10.4-r0","3.10.5-r0","3.10.5-r1","3.10.5-r2","3.10.6-r0","3.10.6-r1","3.10.7-r0","3.10.8-r0","3.10.8-r1","3.10.8-r2","3.10.8-r3","3.2.0-r0","3.2.3-r0","3.3.0-r0","3.3.2-r0","3.3.3-r0","3.3.4-r0","3.4.1-r0","3.4.2-r0","3.4.2-r1","3.4.3-r1","3.4.3-r2","3.5.0-r0","3.5.1-r0","3.5.1-r1","3.5.1-r2","3.5.1-r3","3.5.2-r0","3.5.2-r1","3.5.2-r10","3.5.2-r2","3.5.2-r3","3.5.2-r4","3.5.2-r5","3.5.2-r6","3.5.2-r7","3.5.2-r8","3.5.2-r9","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.
