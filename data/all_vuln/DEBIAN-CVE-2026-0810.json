The `gix_date::parse::TimeBuf::as_str` function can generate strings containing invalid non-UTF8 characters. This issue violates the internal safety invariants of the `TimeBuf` component, leading to undefined behavior when these malformed strings are subsequently processed. This could potentially result in application instability or other unforeseen consequences.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"rust-gix-date","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/rust-gix-date?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.9.3-1","0.9.3-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-0810.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rust-gix-date","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/rust-gix-date?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.9.3-1","0.9.3-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2026-0810.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2026-0810"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H"}]}
