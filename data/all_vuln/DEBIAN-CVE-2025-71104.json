{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-71104","published":"2026-01-14T15:15:59.423Z","modified":"2026-01-15T11:17:24.000346Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-71104"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: x86: Fix VM hard lockup after prolonged inactivity with periodic HV timer  When advancing the target expiration for the guest's APIC timer in periodic mode, set the expiration to \"now\" if the target expiration is in the past (similar to what is done in update_target_expiration()).  Blindly adding the period to the previous target expiration can result in KVM generating a practically unbounded number of hrtimer IRQs due to programming an expired timer over and over.  In extreme scenarios, e.g. if userspace pauses/suspends a VM for an extended duration, this can even cause hard lockups in the host.  Currently, the bug only affects Intel CPUs when using the hypervisor timer (HV timer), a.k.a. the VMX preemption timer.  Unlike the software timer, a.k.a. hrtimer, which KVM keeps running even on exits to userspace, the HV timer only runs while the guest is active.  As a result, if the vCPU does not run for an extended duration, there will be a huge gap between the target expiration and the current time the vCPU resumes running. Because the target expiration is incremented by only one period on each timer expiration, this leads to a series of timer expirations occurring rapidly after the vCPU/VM resumes.  More critically, when the vCPU first triggers a periodic HV timer expiration after resuming, advancing the expiration by only one period will result in a target expiration in the past.  As a result, the delta may be calculated as a negative value.  When the delta is converted into an absolute value (tscdeadline is an unsigned u64), the resulting value can overflow what the HV timer is capable of programming.  I.e. the large value will exceed the VMX Preemption Timer's maximum bit width of cpu_preemption_timer_multi + 32, and thus cause KVM to switch from the HV timer to the software timer (hrtimers).  After switching to the software timer, periodic timer expiration callbacks may be executed consecutively within a single clock interrupt handler, because hrtimers honors KVM's request for an expiration in the past and immediately re-invokes KVM's callback after reprogramming.  And because the interrupt handler runs with IRQs disabled, restarting KVM's hrtimer over and over until the target expiration is advanced to \"now\" can result in a hard lockup.  E.g. the following hard lockup was triggered in the host when running a Windows VM (only relevant because it used the APIC timer in periodic mode) after resuming the VM from a long suspend (in the host).
