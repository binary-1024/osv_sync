  "details": "A flaw was found in the way the dumpable flag setting was handled when certain SUID binaries executed its descendants. The prerequisite is a SUID binary that sets real UID equal to effective UID, and real GID equal to effective GID. The descendant will then have a dumpable value set to 1. As a result, if the descendant process crashes and core_pattern is set to a relative value, its core dump is stored in the current directory with uid:gid permissions. An unprivileged local user with eligible root SUID binary could use this flaw to place core dumps into root-owned directories, potentially resulting in escalation of privileges.",
