{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"DEBIAN-CVE-2025-68729","published":"2025-12-24T11:16:02.200Z","modified":"2025-12-28T05:19:47.220313Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-68729"],"details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath12k: Fix MSDU buffer types handling in RX error path  Currently, packets received on the REO exception ring from unassociated peers are of MSDU buffer type, while the driver expects link descriptor type packets. These packets are not parsed further due to a return check on packet type in ath12k_hal_desc_reo_parse_err(), but the associated skb is not freed. This may lead to kernel crashes and buffer leaks.  Hence to fix, update the RX error handler to explicitly drop MSDU buffer type packets received on the REO exception ring. This prevents further processing of invalid packets and ensures stability in the RX error handling path.
