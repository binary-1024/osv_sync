This interface can be called by any user who has completed login authentication, and it returns the plaintext authentication Tokens of all users currently logged in to the system. As a result, ordinary users can obtain the administrator's authentication Token through this interface, thereby forging an administrator account, gaining the system's management permissions, and taking over the system.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pig-mesh/pig","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"a24a044ede1fdfcca1e37bd9664a905b494d88b5"}]}],"versions":["3.5.3","3.7.6","3.8.0","3.8.1","3.8.2","v3.4.3","v3.5.2","v3.6.0","v3.6.1","v3.6.2","v3.6.3","v3.6.4","v3.7.1","v3.7.2","v3.7.5","v3.7.6","v3.8.0","v3.8.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-63691.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/LockeTom/vulnerability/blob/main/md/pig_Information_disclosure_vulnerability.md"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/pig-mesh/pig/issues/1202"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
