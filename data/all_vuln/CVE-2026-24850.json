{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-24850","published":"2026-01-28T00:24:53.146Z","modified":"2026-01-29T06:48:15.257723Z","aliases":["GHSA-5x2r-hc65-25f9"],"summary":"ML-DSA Signature Verification Accepts Signatures with Repeated Hint Indices","details":"The ML-DSA crate is a Rust implementation of the Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Standard (ML-DSA). Starting in version 0.0.4 and prior to version 0.1.0-rc.4, the ML-DSA signature verification implementation in the RustCrypto `ml-dsa` crate incorrectly accepts signatures with repeated (duplicate) hint indices. According to the ML-DSA specification (FIPS 204 / RFC 9881), hint indices within each polynomial must be **strictly increasing**. The current implementation uses a non-strict monotonic check (`<=` instead of `<`), allowing duplicate indices. This is a regression bug. The original implementation was correct, but a commit in version 0.0.4 inadvertently changed the strict `<` comparison to `<=`, introducing the vulnerability. Version 0.1.0-rc.4 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rustcrypto/signatures","events":[{"introduced":"ea7a000fa4ddac2ddc3eedca2666ac1959736712"},{"fixed":"f5901031ac84167a28c8d5c47773e13298b417b9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-24850.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9881"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/C2SP/wycheproof"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/C2SP/wycheproof/blob/master/testvectors_v1/mldsa_44_verify_test.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/C2SP/wycheproof/blob/master/testvectors_v1/mldsa_65_verify_test.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/C2SP/wycheproof/blob/master/testvectors_v1/mldsa_87_verify_test.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24850.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/RustCrypto/signatures/commit/400961412be2e2ab787942cf30e0a9b66b37a54a"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/RustCrypto/signatures/commit/b01c3b73dd08d0094e089aa234f78b6089ec1f38"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/RustCrypto/signatures/issues/894"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/RustCrypto/signatures/pull/895"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/RustCrypto/signatures/security/advisories/GHSA-5x2r-hc65-25f9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24850"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-347"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/24xxx/CVE-2026-24850.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
