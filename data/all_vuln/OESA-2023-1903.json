Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nVim is a UNIX editor that, prior to version 9.0.2121, has a heap-use-after-free vulnerability. When executing a `:s` command for the very first time and using a sub-replace-special atom inside the substitution part, it is possible that the recursive `:s` call causes free-ing of memory which may later then be accessed by the initial `:s` command. The user must intentionally execute the payload and the whole process is a bit tricky to do since it seems to work only reliably for the very first :s command. It may also cause a crash of Vim. Version 9.0.2121 contains a fix for this issue.(CVE-2023-48706)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"vim","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/vim&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9.0-23.oe2203sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["vim-minimal-9.0-23.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","vim-debuginfo-9.0-23.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","vim-debugsource-9.0-23.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","vim-common-9.0-23.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","vim-X11-9.0-23.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","vim-enhanced-9.0-23.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"noarch":["vim-filesystem-9.0-23.oe2203sp1.noarch.rpm"],"src":["vim-9.0-23.oe2203sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["vim-enhanced-9.0-23.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","vim-common-9.0-23.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","vim-debuginfo-9.0-23.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","vim-debugsource-9.0-23.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","vim-X11-9.0-23.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","vim-minimal-9.0-23.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2023-1903.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2023-1903"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48706"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"Low"}}
