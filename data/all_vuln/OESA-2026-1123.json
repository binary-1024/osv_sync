In addition it contains additional filters and software developed independently of Apple, especially filters for the PDF-centric printing workflow introduced by OpenPrinting and a daemon to browse Bonjour broadcasts of remote CUPS printers to make these printers available locally and to provide backward compatibility to the old CUPS broadcasting and browsing of CUPS 1.5.x and older.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\ncups-filters contains backends, filters, and other software required to get the CUPS printing service working on operating systems other than macOS. In versions 2.0.1 and prior, a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in the rastertopclx filter causes the program to crash with a segmentation fault when processing maliciously crafted input data. This issue can be exploited to trigger memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
