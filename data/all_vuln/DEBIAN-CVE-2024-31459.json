Prior to version 1.2.27, there is a file inclusion issue in the `lib/plugin.php` file. Combined with SQL injection vulnerabilities, remote code execution can be implemented. There is a file inclusion issue with the `api_plugin_hook()` function in the `lib/plugin.php` file, which reads the plugin_hooks and plugin_config tables in database. The read data is directly used to concatenate the file path which is used for file inclusion. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"cacti","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/cacti?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.16+ds1-2+deb11u4"}]}],"versions":["1.2.16+ds1-2","1.2.16+ds1-2+deb11u1","1.2.16+ds1-2+deb11u2","1.2.16+ds1-2+deb11u3"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31459.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cacti","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/cacti?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.24+ds1-1+deb12u3"}]}],"versions":["1.2.24+ds1-1","1.2.24+ds1-1+deb12u1","1.2.24+ds1-1+deb12u2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31459.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cacti","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/cacti?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.27+ds1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31459.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cacti","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/cacti?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.27+ds1-1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2024-31459.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-31459"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
