This package provides the client applications xfreerdp and wlfreerdp.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nFreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. This issue affects Clients only. Integer underflow leading to DOS (e.g. abort due to `WINPR_ASSERT` with default compilation flags). When an insufficient blockLen is provided, and proper length validation is not performed, an Integer Underflow occurs, leading to a Denial of Service (DOS) vulnerability. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n(CVE-2023-39350)\r\n\r\nFreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions of FreeRDP are subject to a Null Pointer Dereference leading a crash in the RemoteFX (rfx) handling.  Inside the `rfx_process_message_tileset` function, the program allocates tiles using `rfx_allocate_tiles` for the number of numTiles. If the initialization process of tiles is not completed for various reasons, tiles will have a NULL pointer. Which may be accessed in further processing and would cause a program crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.(CVE-2023-39351)\r\n\r\nFreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are subject to an invalid offset validation leading to Out Of Bound Write. This can be triggered when the values `rect-&gt;left` and `rect-&gt;top` are exactly equal to `surface-&gt;width` and  `surface-&gt;height`. eg. `rect-&gt;left` == `surface-&gt;width` &amp;&amp; `rect-&gt;top` == `surface-&gt;height`. In practice this should cause a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n(CVE-2023-39352)\r\n\r\nFreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are subject to a missing offset validation leading to Out Of Bound Read. In the `libfreerdp/codec/rfx.c` file there is no offset validation in `tile-&gt;quantIdxY`, `tile-&gt;quantIdxCb`, and `tile-&gt;quantIdxCr`. As a result crafted input can lead to an out of bounds read access which in turn will cause a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.(CVE-2023-39353)\r\n\r\nFreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are subject to an Out-Of-Bounds Read in the `nsc_rle_decompress_data` function. The Out-Of-Bounds Read occurs because it processes `context-&gt;Planes` without  checking if it contains data of sufficient length. Should an attacker be able to leverage this vulnerability they may be able to cause a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.(CVE-2023-39354)\r\n\r\nFreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. In affected versions a missing offset validation may lead to an Out Of Bound Read in the function `gdi_multi_opaque_rect`. In particular there is no code to validate if the value `multi_opaque_rect-&gt;numRectangles` is less than 45. Looping through `multi_opaque_rect-&gt;`numRectangles without proper boundary checks can lead to Out-of-Bounds Read errors which will likely lead to a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n(CVE-2023-39356)\r\n\r\nFreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are subject to an Integer-Underflow leading to Out-Of-Bound Read in the `zgfx_decompress_segment` function. In the context of `CopyMemory`, it&apos;s possible to read data beyond the transmitted packet range and likely cause a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.(CVE-2023-40181)\r\n\r\nFreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are subject to an IntegerOverflow leading to Out-Of-Bound Write Vulnerability in the `gdi_CreateSurface` function. This issue affects FreeRDP based clients only. FreeRDP proxies are not affected as image decoding is not done by a proxy. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.(CVE-2023-40186)\r\n\r\nFreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are subject to an Out-Of-Bounds Read in the `general_LumaToYUV444` function. This Out-Of-Bounds Read occurs because processing is done on the `in` variable without checking if it contains data of sufficient length. Insufficient data for the `in` variable may cause errors or crashes. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.(CVE-2023-40188)\r\n\r\nFreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are subject to an Out-Of-Bounds Write in the `clear_decompress_bands_data` function in which there is no offset validation. Abuse of this vulnerability may lead to an out of bounds write. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. there are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.(CVE-2023-40567)\r\n\r\nFreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are subject to an Out-Of-Bounds Write in the `progressive_decompress` function. This issue is likely down to incorrect calculations of the `nXSrc` and `nYSrc` variables. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. there are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.(CVE-2023-40569)\r\n\r\nFreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. In affected versions there is a Global-Buffer-Overflow in the ncrush_decompress function. Feeding crafted input into this function can trigger the overflow which has only been shown to cause a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.(CVE-2023-40589)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"freerdp","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/freerdp&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.11.1-1.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["freerdp-debugsource-2.11.1-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-2.11.1-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-debuginfo-2.11.1-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-help-2.11.1-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libwinpr-devel-2.11.1-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-devel-2.11.1-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libwinpr-2.11.1-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["freerdp-2.11.1-1.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["freerdp-help-2.11.1-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libwinpr-2.11.1-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libwinpr-devel-2.11.1-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","freerdp-debugsource-2.11.1-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","freerdp-devel-2.11.1-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","freerdp-2.11.1-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","freerdp-debuginfo-2.11.1-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2023-1656.json"}},{"package":{"name":"freerdp","ecosystem":"openEuler:20.03-LTS-SP3","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/freerdp&distro=openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.11.1-1.oe1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["freerdp-debugsource-2.11.1-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-devel-2.11.1-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-debuginfo-2.11.1-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libwinpr-devel-2.11.1-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-2.11.1-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","libwinpr-2.11.1-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-help-2.11.1-1.oe1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["freerdp-2.11.1-1.oe1.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["freerdp-devel-2.11.1-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libwinpr-devel-2.11.1-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","freerdp-debuginfo-2.11.1-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","freerdp-debugsource-2.11.1-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","freerdp-2.11.1-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","freerdp-help-2.11.1-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm","libwinpr-2.11.1-1.oe1.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2023-1656.json"}},{"package":{"name":"freerdp","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/freerdp&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.11.1-1.oe2203sp2"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["freerdp-devel-2.11.1-1.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-help-2.11.1-1.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-debugsource-2.11.1-1.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","libwinpr-devel-2.11.1-1.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","libwinpr-2.11.1-1.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-2.11.1-1.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-debuginfo-2.11.1-1.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","libwinpr-devel-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-help-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-devel-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-debuginfo-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","libwinpr-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-debugsource-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","libwinpr-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-devel-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-debugsource-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-help-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","libwinpr-devel-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-debuginfo-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp2.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["freerdp-2.11.1-1.oe2203.src.rpm","freerdp-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.src.rpm","freerdp-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp2.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["freerdp-debuginfo-2.11.1-1.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","freerdp-devel-2.11.1-1.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","freerdp-2.11.1-1.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","libwinpr-devel-2.11.1-1.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","libwinpr-2.11.1-1.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","freerdp-help-2.11.1-1.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","freerdp-debugsource-2.11.1-1.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","libwinpr-devel-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","libwinpr-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","freerdp-devel-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","freerdp-help-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","freerdp-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","freerdp-debugsource-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","freerdp-debuginfo-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.x86_64.rpm","freerdp-devel-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","libwinpr-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","freerdp-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","freerdp-help-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","freerdp-debuginfo-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","freerdp-debugsource-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm","libwinpr-devel-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp2.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2023-1656.json"}},{"package":{"name":"freerdp","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS-SP1","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/freerdp&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP1"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["freerdp-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","libwinpr-devel-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-help-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-devel-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-debuginfo-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","libwinpr-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm","freerdp-debugsource-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["freerdp-2.11.1-1.oe2203sp1.src.rpm"],"x86_
