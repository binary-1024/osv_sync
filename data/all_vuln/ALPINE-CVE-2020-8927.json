It is recommended to update your Brotli library to 1.0.8 or later. If one cannot update, we recommend to use the \"streaming\" API as opposed to the \"one-shot\" API, and impose chunk size limits.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"brotli","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.12","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/brotli?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.9-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.3-r0","1.0.4-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.6-r0","1.0.7-r0","1.0.7-r1","1.0.7-r2","1.0.7-r3","1.0.7-r4","1.0.7-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-8927.json"}},{"package":{"name":"brotli","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.13","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/brotli?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.9-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.3-r0","1.0.4-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.6-r0","1.0.7-r0","1.0.7-r1","1.0.7-r2","1.0.7-r3","1.0.7-r4","1.0.7-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-8927.json"}},{"package":{"name":"brotli","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.14","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/brotli?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.9-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.3-r0","1.0.4-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.6-r0","1.0.7-r0","1.0.7-r1","1.0.7-r2","1.0.7-r3","1.0.7-r4","1.0.7-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-8927.json"}},{"package":{"name":"brotli","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.15","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/brotli?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.9-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.3-r0","1.0.4-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.6-r0","1.0.7-r0","1.0.7-r1","1.0.7-r2","1.0.7-r3","1.0.7-r4","1.0.7-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-8927.json"}},{"package":{"name":"brotli","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.16","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/brotli?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.9-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.3-r0","1.0.4-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.6-r0","1.0.7-r0","1.0.7-r1","1.0.7-r2","1.0.7-r3","1.0.7-r4","1.0.7-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-8927.json"}},{"package":{"name":"brotli","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.17","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/brotli?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.9-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.3-r0","1.0.4-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.6-r0","1.0.7-r0","1.0.7-r1","1.0.7-r2","1.0.7-r3","1.0.7-r4","1.0.7-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-8927.json"}},{"package":{"name":"brotli","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.18","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/brotli?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.9-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.3-r0","1.0.4-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.6-r0","1.0.7-r0","1.0.7-r1","1.0.7-r2","1.0.7-r3","1.0.7-r4","1.0.7-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-8927.json"}},{"package":{"name":"brotli","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.19","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/brotli?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.9-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.3-r0","1.0.4-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.6-r0","1.0.7-r0","1.0.7-r1","1.0.7-r2","1.0.7-r3","1.0.7-r4","1.0.7-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-8927.json"}},{"package":{"name":"brotli","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/brotli?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.9-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.3-r0","1.0.4-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.6-r0","1.0.7-r0","1.0.7-r1","1.0.7-r2","1.0.7-r3","1.0.7-r4","1.0.7-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-8927.json"}},{"package":{"name":"brotli","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/brotli?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.9-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.3-r0","1.0.4-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.6-r0","1.0.7-r0","1.0.7-r1","1.0.7-r2","1.0.7-r3","1.0.7-r4","1.0.7-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-8927.json"}},{"package":{"name":"brotli","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/brotli?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.9-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.3-r0","1.0.4-r0","1.0.5-r0","1.0.6-r0","1.0.7-r0","1.0.7-r1","1.0.7-r2","1.0.7-r3","1.0.7-r4","1.0.7-r5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2020-8927.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2020-8927"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L"}]}
