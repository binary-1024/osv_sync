However, we have determined that this fix is good security hygiene and may prevent issues in other areas not yet discovered.\n\n### Summary\nWhen an administrative user creates a new database host they are prompted to provide a `Host` value which is expected to be a domain or IP address. When an invalid value is encountered and passed back to `gethostaddr` and/or directly to the MySQL connection tooling, an error is returned. This error is then passed back along to the front-end, but was not properly sanitized when rendered.\n\nTherefore it is possible for an admin to _knowingly_ paste a malicious payload such as `<script>prompt(document.domain)</script>` into the `Host` field and XSS themselves.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"pterodactyl/panel","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/pterodactyl/panel"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.12.0"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0-beta","v0.1.1-beta","v0.1.2-beta","v0.2.0-beta","v0.3.0-beta","v0.4.0-beta","v0.4.1-beta","v0.5.0","v0.5.0-rc.1","v0.5.0-rc.2","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.5.5","v0.5.6","v0.5.7","v0.6.0","v0.6.0-beta.1","v0.6.0-beta.2","v0.6.0-beta.2.1","v0.6.0-rc.1","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.7.0","v0.7.0-beta.1","v0.7.0-beta.2","v0.7.0-beta.3","v0.7.0-beta.4","v0.7.0-rc.1","v0.7.0-rc.2","v0.7.1","v0.7.10","v0.7.11","v0.7.12","v0.7.13","v0.7.14","v0.7.15","v0.7.16","v0.7.17","v0.7.18","v0.7.19","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.4","v0.7.5","v0.7.6","v0.7.7","v0.7.8","v0.7.9","v0.8.0-alpha.1","v0.8.0-alpha.2","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-beta.1","v1.0.0-beta.2","v1.0.0-beta.3","v1.0.0-beta.4","v1.0.0-beta.5","v1.0.0-beta.6","v1.0.0-beta.7","v1.0.0-rc.1","v1.0.0-rc.2","v1.0.0-rc.3","v1.0.0-rc.4","v1.0.0-rc.5","v1.0.0-rc.6","v1.0.0-rc.7","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.10.3","v1.10.4","v1.11.0","v1.11.0-rc.1","v1.11.0-rc.2","v1.11.1","v1.11.10","v1.11.11","v1.11.2","v1.11.3","v1.11.4","v1.11.5","v1.11.6","v1.11.7","v1.11.8","v1.11.9","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-mgr9-6c2j-jxrq/GHSA-mgr9-6c2j-jxrq.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/security/advisories/GHSA-mgr9-6c2j-jxrq"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/1570ff250939b75b3ba8cd03e5025d8293544ed4"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-12-30T15:13:52Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
