In\nthe error path, we weren't calling dma_fence_put() so all those fences\ngot leaked.  Also, in the krealloc_array failure case, we weren't\nfreeing the fences array.  Instead, ensure that i and fences are always\nzero-initialized and dma_fence_put() all the fences and kfree(fences) on\nevery error path.","references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0d514185ae792d3a1903c8e1a83899aa996705ce"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/19edcd97727aae9362444a859a24d99a8730cb27"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/19f51c2529339280d2c8c6427cd3e21ddf1ac3f8"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/41f45e91c92c8480242ea448d54e28c753b13902"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e0355a0ad31a1d677b2a4514206de4902bd550e8"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ffe000217c5068c5da07ccb1c0f8cce7ad767435"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
