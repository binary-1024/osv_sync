The umask() call inside archive_write_disk_posix.c changes the umask of the whole process for a very short period of time; a race condition with another thread can lead to a permanent umask 0 setting. Such a race condition could lead to implicit directory creation with permissions 0777 (without the sticky bit), which means that any low-privileged local user can delete and rename files inside those directories.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libarchive","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libarchive?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.4.3-2","3.4.3-2+deb11u1","3.4.3-2+deb11u2","3.5.2-1","3.6.0-1","3.6.2-1","3.7.2-1","3.7.2-1.1","3.7.2-1.1~exp1","3.7.2-2","3.7.2-2.1","3.7.4-1","3.7.4-1.1","3.7.4-2","3.7.4-3","3.7.4-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-30571.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libarchive","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libarchive?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.6.2-1","3.6.2-1+deb12u1","3.6.2-1+deb12u2","3.6.2-1+deb12u3","3.7.2-1","3.7.2-1.1","3.7.2-1.1~exp1","3.7.2-2","3.7.2-2.1","3.7.4-1","3.7.4-1.1","3.7.4-2","3.7.4-3","3.7.4-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-30571.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libarchive","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libarchive?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.7.4-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-30571.json"}},{"package":{"name":"libarchive","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libarchive?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["3.7.4-4"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"unimportant"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2023-30571.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-30571"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H"}]}
