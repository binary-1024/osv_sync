Fix this by checking to see if the vnode->volume pointer actually points anywhere before following it in afs_getattr().  This can be tested by stat'ing a directory in /afs.  It may be sufficient just to do \"ls /afs\" and the oops looks something like:          BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000020         ...
