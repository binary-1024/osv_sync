Prior to version 0.40.3, the Eventlet WSGI parser is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling due to improper handling of HTTP trailer sections. This vulnerability could enable attackers to, bypass front-end security controls, launch targeted attacks against active site users, and poison web caches. This problem has been patched in Eventlet 0.40.3 by dropping trailers which is a breaking change if a backend behind eventlet.wsgi proxy requires trailers. A workaround involves not using eventlet.wsgi facing untrusted clients.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"python-eventlet","ecosystem":"Debian:11","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-eventlet?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.26.1-7+deb11u2"}]}],"versions":["0.26.1-7","0.26.1-7+deb11u1"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-58068.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-eventlet","ecosystem":"Debian:12","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-eventlet?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"versions":["0.33.1-4","0.33.3-1","0.33.3-2","0.33.3-2.1","0.33.3-3","0.35.1-1","0.35.1-2","0.35.1-3","0.36.1-1","0.36.1-10","0.36.1-11","0.36.1-12","0.36.1-2","0.36.1-3","0.36.1-4","0.36.1-5","0.36.1-6","0.36.1-7","0.36.1-8","0.36.1-9","0.39.1-1","0.39.1-2","0.40.1-1","0.40.1-2","0.40.1-3","0.40.2-1","0.40.3-1","0.40.3-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-58068.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-eventlet","ecosystem":"Debian:13","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-eventlet?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.39.1-2+deb13u1"}]}],"versions":["0.39.1-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-58068.json"}},{"package":{"name":"python-eventlet","ecosystem":"Debian:14","purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python-eventlet?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.40.1-3"}]}],"versions":["0.39.1-2","0.40.1-1","0.40.1-2"],"ecosystem_specific":{"urgency":"not yet assigned"},"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/debian-cve-osv/DEBIAN-CVE-2025-58068.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-58068"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
