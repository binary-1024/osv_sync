  "summary": "mailman - cross-site scripting, directory traversal",
  "details": "\nDue to an incompatibility between Python 1.5 and 2.1 the last mailman\nupdate did not run with Python 1.5 anymore. This problem is corrected\nwith this update. This advisory only updates the packages updated\nwith DSA 674-2. The version in unstable is not affected since it is\nnot supposed to work with Python 1.5 anymore. For completeness below\nis the original advisory text:\n\n\n\n> \n> Two security related problems have been discovered in mailman,\n> web-based GNU mailing list manager. The Common Vulnerabilities and\n> Exposures project identifies the following problems:\n> \n> \n> * [CAN-2004-1177](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1177)\n> Florian Weimer discovered a cross-site scripting vulnerability in\n>  mailman's automatically generated error messages. An attacker\n>  could craft a URL containing JavaScript (or other content\n>  embedded into HTML) which triggered a mailman error page that\n>  would include the malicious code verbatim.\n> \n> * [CAN-2005-0202](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0202)\n> Several listmasters have noticed unauthorised access to archives\n>  of private lists and the list configuration itself, including the\n>  users passwords. Administrators are advised to check the\n>  webserver logfiles for requests that contain \"/...../\" and the\n>  path to the archives or configuration. This does only seem to\n>  affect installations running on web servers that do not strip\n>  slashes, such as Apache 1.3.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nFor the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.0.11-1woody11.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.1.5-6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your mailman package.\n\n\n",
