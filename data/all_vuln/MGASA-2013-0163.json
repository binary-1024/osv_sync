A remote\nattacker could provide a specially-crafted URL that, when visited could lead\nto local file system traversal or, potentially, ability to read content of\nany local file, accessible with the privileges of the user running the\nwebserver (CVE-2012-3251).\n\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way 'langwiz' example\nscript of GeSHi, a generic syntax highlighter, performed sanitization of\ncertain HTTP GET / POST request variables (prior dumping their content). A\nremote attacker could provide a specially-crafted URL that, when visited\nwould lead to arbitrary HTML or web script execution (CVE-2012-3522).\n",
