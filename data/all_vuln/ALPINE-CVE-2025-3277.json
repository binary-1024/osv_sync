The resulting, truncated integer is then used to allocate a buffer. When SQLite then writes the resulting string to the buffer, it uses the original, untruncated size and thus a wild Heap Buffer overflow of size ~4GB can be triggered. This can result in arbitrary code execution.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"sqlite","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/sqlite?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.48.0-r1"}]}],"versions":["3.10.2-r2","3.11.0-r2","3.11.1-r2","3.12.0-r2","3.12.1-r2","3.12.2-r2","3.13.0-r2","3.14.1-r2","3.14.2-r2","3.15.0-r2","3.15.1-r2","3.15.2-r2","3.16.0-r2","3.16.2-r2","3.17.0-r2","3.18.0-r2","3.19.3-r2","3.20.0-r2","3.20.1-r2","3.21.0-r2","3.22.0-r2","3.23.0-r2","3.23.1-r0","3.23.1-r2","3.24.0-r0","3.24.0-r1","3.26.0-r0","3.26.0-r1","3.26.0-r2","3.26.0-r3","3.27.2-r0","3.28.0-r0","3.29.0-r0","3.30.0-r0","3.30.1-r0","3.30.1-r1","3.31.1-r0","3.31.1-r1","3.31.1-r2","3.31.1-r3","3.32.0-r0","3.32.1-r0","3.32.2-r0","3.32.3-r0","3.33.0-r0","3.34.0-r0","3.34.0-r1","3.34.1-r0","3.34.1-r1","3.35.0-r0","3.35.2-r0","3.35.3-r0","3.35.4-r0","3.35.5-r0","3.36.0-r0","3.37.0-r0","3.37.1-r0","3.37.2-r0","3.38.0-r0","3.38.2-r0","3.38.3-r0","3.38.4-r0","3.38.5-r0","3.39.0-r0","3.39.1-r0","3.39.2-r0","3.39.3-r0","3.39.4-r0","3.40.0-r0","3.40.1-r0","3.41.0-r0","3.41.0-r1","3.41.1-r0","3.41.2-r0","3.41.2-r1","3.41.2-r2","3.41.2-r3","3.42.0-r0","3.42.0-r1","3.42.0-r2","3.43.0-r0","3.43.1-r0","3.43.1-r1","3.43.2-r0","3.44.0-r0","3.44.1-r0","3.44.2-r0","3.45.0-r0","3.45.1-r0","3.45.2-r0","3.45.3-r0","3.45.3-r1","3.46.0-r0","3.46.1-r0","3.47.0-r0","3.47.1-r0","3.48.0-r0","3.6.10-r0","3.6.15-r0","3.6.22-r0","3.6.22-r1","3.6.22-r2","3.7.0-r2","3.7.0.1-r2","3.7.1-r2","3.7.10-r2","3.7.11-r2","3.7.12-r2","3.7.12.1-r2","3.7.13-r2","3.7.14-r2","3.7.14.1-r2","3.7.15-r2","3.7.15.1-r2","3.7.15.2-r2","3.7.16.1-r2","3.7.16.2-r2","3.7.17-r2","3.7.2-r2","3.7.3-r2","3.7.4-r2","3.7.5-r2","3.7.6-r2","3.7.6.1-r2","3.7.6.2-r2","3.7.6.3-r2","3.7.7-r2","3.7.7.1-r2","3.7.8-r2","3.7.9-r2","3.8.0-r2","3.8.0.1-r2","3.8.0.2-r2","3.8.1-r2","3.8.10-r2","3.8.10.1-r2","3.8.10.2-r2","3.8.11-r2","3.8.11.1-r2","3.8.2-r2","3.8.3-r2","3.8.3.1-r2","3.8.4-r2","3.8.4.1-r2","3.8.4.2-r2","3.8.4.3-r2","3.8.5-r2","3.8.6-r2","3.8.7-r2","3.8.7.1-r2","3.8.7.2-r2","3.8.7.3-r2","3.8.7.4-r2","3.8.8.1-r2","3.8.8.2-r2","3.8.8.3-r2","3.8.9-r2","3.9.0-r2","3.9.1-r2","3.9.2-r2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-3277.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2025-3277"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
