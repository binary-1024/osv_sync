However, the &apos;ipv6&apos; is a union that shares\nthe space between &apos;nd&apos; and &apos;ct_orig&apos; that holds the original tuple\nconntrack metadata parsed from the OVS_PACKET_ATTR_KEY.\r\n\r\nND packets should not normally have conntrack state, so it&apos;s fine to\nshare the space, but normal ICMPv6 Echo packets or maybe other types of\nICMPv6 can have the state attached and it should not be overwritten.\r\n\r\nThe issue results in all but the last 4 bytes of the destination\naddress being wiped from the original conntrack tuple leading to\nincorrect packet matching and potentially executing wrong actions\nin case this packet recirculates within the datapath or goes back\nto userspace.\r\n\r\nND fields should not be accessed in non-ND packets, so not clearing\nthem should be fine.  Executing memset() only for actual ND packets to\navoid the issue.\r\n\r\nInitializing the whole thing before parsing is needed because ND packet\nmay not contain all the options.\r\n\r\nThe issue only affects the OVS_PACKET_CMD_EXECUTE path and doesn&apos;t\naffect packets entering OVS datapath from network interfaces, because\nin this case CT metadata is populated from skb after the packet is\nalready parsed.(CVE-2024-38558)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\ngfs2: Fix potential glock use-after-free on unmount\r\n\r\nWhen a DLM lockspace is released and there ares still locks in that\nlockspace, DLM will unlock those locks automatically.  Commit\nfb6791d100d1b started exploiting this behavior to speed up filesystem\nunmount: gfs2 would simply free glocks it didn&apos;t want to unlock and then\nrelease the lockspace.  This didn&apos;t take the bast callbacks for\nasynchronous lock contention notifications into account, which remain\nactive until until a lock is unlocked or its lockspace is released.\r\n\r\nTo prevent those callbacks from accessing deallocated objects, put the\nglocks that should not be unlocked on the sd_dead_glocks list, release\nthe lockspace, and only then free those glocks.\r\n\r\nAs an additional measure, ignore unexpected ast and bast callbacks if\nthe receiving glock is dead.(CVE-2024-38570)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\ndrm/amdgpu/mes: fix use-after-free issue\r\n\r\nDelete fence fallback timer to fix the ramdom\nuse-after-free issue.\r\n\r\nv2: move to amdgpu_mes.c(CVE-2024-38581)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nnilfs2: fix use-after-free of timer for log writer thread\r\n\r\nPatch series &quot;nilfs2: fix log writer related issues&quot;.\r\n\r\nThis bug fix series covers three nilfs2 log writer-related issues,\nincluding a timer use-after-free issue and potential deadlock issue on\nunmount, and a potential freeze issue in event synchronization found\nduring their analysis.  Details are described in each commit log.\r\n\r\n\nThis patch (of 3):\r\n\r\nA use-after-free issue has been reported regarding the timer sc_timer on\nthe nilfs_sc_info structure.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that even though it is used to wake up a sleeping log\nwriter thread, sc_timer is not shut down until the nilfs_sc_info structure\nis about to be freed, and is used regardless of the thread&apos;s lifetime.\r\n\r\nFix this issue by limiting the use of sc_timer only while the log writer\nthread is alive.(CVE-2024-38583)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nr8169: Fix possible ring buffer corruption on fragmented Tx packets.\r\n\r\nAn issue was found on the RTL8125b when transmitting small fragmented\npackets, whereby invalid entries were inserted into the transmit ring\nbuffer, subsequently leading to calls to dma_unmap_single() with a null\naddress.\r\n\r\nThis was caused by rtl8169_start_xmit() not noticing changes to nr_frags\nwhich may occur when small packets are padded (to work around hardware\nquirks) in rtl8169_tso_csum_v2().\r\n\r\nTo fix this, postpone inspecting nr_frags until after any padding has been\napplied.(CVE-2024-38586)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nopenrisc: traps: Don&apos;t send signals to kernel mode threads\r\n\r\nOpenRISC exception handling sends signals to user processes on floating\npoint exceptions and trap instructions (for debugging) among others.\nThere is a bug where the trap handling logic may send signals to kernel\nthreads, we should not send these signals to kernel threads, if that\nhappens we treat it as an error.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds conditions to die if the kernel receives these\nexceptions in kernel mode code.(CVE-2024-38614)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nBluetooth: HCI: Remove HCI_AMP support\r\n\r\nSince BT_HS has been remove HCI_AMP controllers no longer has any use so\nremove it along with the capability of creating AMP controllers.\r\n\r\nSince we no longer need to differentiate between AMP and Primary\ncontrollers, as only HCI_PRIMARY is left, this also remove\nhdev-&gt;dev_type altogether.(CVE-2024-38620)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nvfio/pci: fix potential memory leak in vfio_intx_enable()\r\n\r\nIf vfio_irq_ctx_alloc() failed will lead to &apos;name&apos; memory leak.(CVE-2024-38632)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\ns390/ap: Fix crash in AP internal function modify_bitmap()\r\n\r\nA system crash like this\r\n\r\n  Failing address: 200000cb7df6f000 TEID: 200000cb7df6f403\n  Fault in home space mode while using kernel ASCE.\n  AS:00000002d71bc007 R3:00000003fe5b8007 S:000000011a446000 P:000000015660c13d\n  Oops: 0038 ilc:3 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n  Modules linked in: mlx5_ib ...\n  CPU: 8 PID: 7556 Comm: bash Not tainted 6.9.0-rc7 #8\n  Hardware name: IBM 3931 A01 704 (LPAR)\n  Krnl PSW : 0704e00180000000 0000014b75e7b606 (ap_parse_bitmap_str+0x10e/0x1f8)\n  R:0 T:1 IO:1 EX:1 Key:0 M:1 W:0 P:0 AS:3 CC:2 PM:0 RI:0 EA:3\n  Krnl GPRS: 0000000000000001 ffffffffffffffc0 0000000000000001 00000048f96b75d3\n  000000cb00000100 ffffffffffffffff ffffffffffffffff 000000cb7df6fce0\n  000000cb7df6fce0 00000000ffffffff 000000000000002b 00000048ffffffff\n  000003ff9b2dbc80 200000cb7df6fcd8 0000014bffffffc0 000000cb7df6fbc8\n  Krnl Code: 0000014b75e7b5fc: a7840047            brc     8,0000014b75e7b68a\n  0000014b75e7b600: 18b2                lr      %r11,%r2\n  #0000014b75e7b602: a7f4000a            brc     15,0000014b75e7b616\n  &gt;0000014b75e7b606: eb22d00000e6        laog    %r2,%r2,0(%r13)\n  0000014b75e7b60c: a7680001            lhi     %r6,1\n  0000014b75e7b610: 187b                lr      %r7,%r11\n  0000014b75e7b612: 84960021            brxh    %r9,%r6,0000014b75e7b654\n  0000014b75e7b616: 18e9                lr      %r14,%r9\n  Call Trace:\n  [&lt;0000014b75e7b606&gt;] ap_parse_bitmap_str+0x10e/0x1f8\n  ([&lt;0000014b75e7b5dc&gt;] ap_parse_bitmap_str+0xe4/0x1f8)\n  [&lt;0000014b75e7b758&gt;] apmask_store+0x68/0x140\n  [&lt;0000014b75679196&gt;] kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x14e/0x1e8\n  [&lt;0000014b75598524&gt;] vfs_write+0x1b4/0x448\n  [&lt;0000014b7559894c&gt;] ksys_write+0x74/0x100\n  [&lt;0000014b7618a440&gt;] __do_syscall+0x268/0x328\n  [&lt;0000014b761a3558&gt;] system_call+0x70/0x98\n  INFO: lockdep is turned off.\n  Last Breaking-Event-Address:\n  [&lt;0000014b75e7b636&gt;] ap_parse_bitmap_str+0x13e/0x1f8\n  Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception: panic_on_oops\r\n\r\noccured when /sys/bus/ap/a[pq]mask was updated with a relative mask value\n(like +0x10-0x12,+60,-90) with one of the numeric values exceeding INT_MAX.\r\n\r\nThe fix is simple: use unsigned long values for the internal variables.

All prior\nentries in the table will be handled correctly.\r\n\r\nThe arm64 ABI requires that struct fields of up to 8 bytes are\nnaturally-aligned, with padding added within a struct such that struct\nare suitably aligned within arrays.\r\n\r\nWhen CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERPOSE=y, the layout of a bug_entry is:\r\n\r\n\tstruct bug_entry {\n\t\tsigned int      bug_addr_disp;\t// 4 bytes\n\t\tsigned int      file_disp;\t// 4 bytes\n\t\tunsigned short  line;\t\t// 2 bytes\n\t\tunsigned short  flags;\t\t// 2 bytes\n\t}\r\n\r\n... with 12 bytes total, requiring 4-byte alignment.\r\n\r\nWhen CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE=n, the layout of a bug_entry is:\r\n\r\n\tstruct bug_entry {\n\t\tsigned int      bug_addr_disp;\t// 4 bytes\n\t\tunsigned short  flags;\t\t// 2 bytes\n\t\t&lt; implicit padding &gt;\t\t// 2 bytes\n\t}\r\n\r\n... with 8 bytes total, with 6 bytes of data and 2 bytes of trailing\npadding, requiring 4-byte alginment.\r\n\r\nWhen we create a bug_entry in assembly, we align the start of the entry\nto 4 bytes, which implicitly handles padding for any prior entries.\nHowever, we do not align the end of the entry, and so when\nCONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE=n, the final entry lacks the trailing padding\nbytes.\r\n\r\nFor the main kernel image this is not a problem as find_bug() doesn&apos;t\ndepend on the trailing padding bytes when searching for entries:\r\n\r\n\tfor (bug = __start___bug_table; bug &lt; __stop___bug_table; ++bug)\n\t\tif (bugaddr == bug_addr(bug))\n\t\t\treturn bug;\r\n\r\nHowever for modules, module_bug_finalize() depends on the trailing\nbytes when calculating the number of entries:\r\n\r\n\tmod-&gt;num_bugs = sechdrs[i].sh_size / sizeof(struct bug_entry);\r\n\r\n... and as the last bug_entry lacks the necessary padding bytes, this entry\nwill not be counted, e.g. in the case of a single entry:\r\n\r\n\tsechdrs[i].sh_size == 6\n\tsizeof(struct bug_entry) == 8;\r\n\r\n\tsechdrs[i].sh_size / sizeof(struct bug_entry) == 0;\r\n\r\nConsequently module_find_bug() will miss the last bug_entry when it does:\r\n\r\n\tfor (i = 0; i &lt; mod-&gt;num_bugs; ++i, ++bug)\n\t\tif (bugaddr == bug_addr(bug))\n\t\t\tgoto out;\r\n\r\n... which can lead to a kenrel panic due to an unhandled bug.\r\n\r\nThis can be demonstrated with the following module:\r\n\r\n\tstatic int __init buginit(void)\n\t{\n\t\tWARN(1, &quot;hello\\n&quot;);\n\t\treturn 0;\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tstatic void __exit bugexit(void)\n\t{\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tmodule_init(buginit);\n\tmodule_exit(bugexit);\n\tMODULE_LICENSE(&quot;GPL&quot;);\r\n\r\n... which will trigger a kernel panic when loaded:\r\n\r\n\t------------[ cut here ]------------\n\thello\n\tUnexpected kernel BRK exception at EL1\n\tInternal error: BRK handler: 00000000f2000800 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n\tModules linked in: hello(O+)\n\tCPU: 0 PID: 50 Comm: insmod Tainted: G           O       6.9.1 #8\n\tHardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)\n\tpstate: 60400005 (nZCv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)\n\tpc : buginit+0x18/0x1000 [hello]\n\tlr : buginit+0x18/0x1000 [hello]\n\tsp : ffff800080533ae0\n\tx29: ffff800080533ae0 x28: 0000000000000000 x27: 0000000000000000\n\tx26: ffffaba8c4e70510 x25: ffff800080533c30 x24: ffffaba8c4a28a58\n\tx23: 0000000000000000 x22: 0000000000000000 x21: ffff3947c0eab3c0\n\tx20: ffffaba8c4e3f000 x19: ffffaba846464000 x18: 0000000000000006\n\tx17: 0000000000000000 x16: ffffaba8c2492834 x15: 0720072007200720\n\tx14: 0720072007200720 x13: ffffaba8c49b27c8 x12: 0000000000000312\n\tx11: 0000000000000106 x10: ffffaba8c4a0a7c8 x9 : ffffaba8c49b27c8\n\tx8 : 00000000ffffefff x7 : ffffaba8c4a0a7c8 x6 : 80000000fffff000\n\tx5 : 0000000000000107 x4 : 0000000000000000 x3 : 0000000000000000\n\tx2 : 0000000000000000 x1 : 0000000000000000 x0 : ffff3947c0eab3c0\n\tCall trace:\n\t buginit+0x18/0x1000 [hello]\n\t do_one_initcall+0x80/0x1c8\n\t do_init_module+0x60/0x218\n\t load_module+0x1ba4/0x1d70\n\t __do_sys_init_module+0x198/0x1d0\n\t __arm64_sys_init_module+0x1c/0x28\n\t invoke_syscall+0x48/0x114\n\t el0_svc\n---truncated---(CVE-2024-39488)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nipv6: sr: fix memleak in seg6_hmac_init_algo\r\n\r\nseg6_hmac_init_algo returns without cleaning up the previous allocations\nif one fails, so it&apos;s going to leak all that memory and the crypto tfms.\r\n\r\nUpdate seg6_hmac_exit to only free the memory when allocated, so we can\nreuse the code directly.(CVE-2024-39489)\r\n\r\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\r\n\r\nsock_map: avoid race between sock_map_close and sk_psock_put\r\n\r\nsk_psock_get will return NULL if the refcount of psock has gone to 0, which\nwill happen when the last call of sk_psock_put is done.
