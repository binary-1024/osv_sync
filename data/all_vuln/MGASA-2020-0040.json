  "details": "The updated packages fix security vulnerabilities:\n\nA signed integer overflow and subsequent segfault that occurred when\nattempting to decompress images with more than 715827882 pixels using\nthe 64-bit C version of TJBench.\n\nOut-of-bounds write in tjDecompressToYUV2() and tjDecompressToYUVPlanes()\n(sometimes manifesting as a double free) that occurred when attempting to\ndecompress grayscale JPEG images that were compressed with a sampling\nfactor other than 1 (for instance, with cjpeg -grayscale -sample 2x2).\n\nA regression introduced by 2.0.2[5] that caused the TurboJPEG API to\nincorrectly identify some JPEG images with unusual sampling factors as\n4:4:4 JPEG images. This was known to cause a buffer overflow when\nattempting to decompress some such images using tjDecompressToYUV2()\nor tjDecompressToYUVPlanes().\n\nAn issue, detected by ASan, whereby attempting to losslessly transform\na specially-crafted malformed JPEG image containing an extremely-high-\nfrequency coefficient block (junk image data that could never be\ngenerated by a legitimate JPEG compressor) could cause the Huffman\nencoder's local buffer to be overrun.\n",
