Prior to version 20.36.1, TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) vulnerabilities in virtualenv allow local attackers to perform symlink-based attacks on directory creation operations. An attacker with local access can exploit a race condition between directory existence checks and creation to redirect virtualenv's app_data and lock file operations to attacker-controlled locations. This issue has been patched in version 20.36.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"dec4cec5d16edaf83a00a658f32d1e032661cebc"}]}],"versions":["20.0.0","20.0.0b1","20.0.0b2","20.0.1","20.0.10","20.0.11","20.0.12","20.0.13","20.0.14","20.0.15","20.0.16","20.0.17","20.0.18","20.0.19","20.0.2","20.0.20","20.0.21","20.0.22","20.0.23","20.0.24","20.0.25","20.0.26","20.0.27","20.0.28","20.0.29","20.0.3","20.0.30","20.0.31","20.0.32","20.0.33","20.0.34","20.0.35","20.0.4","20.0.5","20.0.6","20.0.7","20.0.8","20.0.9","20.1.0","20.10.0","20.11.0","20.11.1","20.11.2","20.12.0","20.12.1","20.13.0","20.13.1","20.13.2","20.13.3","20.14.0","20.14.1","20.15.0","20.15.1","20.16.0","20.16.1","20.16.2","20.16.3","20.16.4","20.16.5","20.16.6","20.16.7","20.17.0","20.17.1","20.18.0","20.19.0","20.2.0","20.2.2","20.20.0","20.21.0","20.21.1","20.22.0","20.23.0","20.23.1","20.24.0","20.24.1","20.24.2","20.24.3","20.24.4","20.24.5","20.24.6","20.25.0","20.25.1","20.25.2","20.25.3","20.26.0","20.26.1","20.26.2","20.26.3","20.26.4","20.26.5","20.27.0","20.27.1","20.27.2","20.27.3","20.28.0","20.28.1","20.29.0","20.29.1","20.29.2","20.29.3","20.3.0","20.3.1","20.30.0","20.31.0","20.31.1","20.31.2","20.32.0","20.33.0","20.33.1","20.34.0","20.35.1","20.35.3","20.36.0","20.4.0","20.4.1","20.4.2","20.4.3","20.4.4","20.4.5","20.4.6","20.4.7","20.5.0","20.6.0","20.7.0","20.7.1","20.7.2","20.8.0","20.8.1","20.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22702.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/security/advisories/GHSA-597g-3phw-6986"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/commit/dec4cec5d16edaf83a00a658f32d1e032661cebc"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/pull/3013"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
