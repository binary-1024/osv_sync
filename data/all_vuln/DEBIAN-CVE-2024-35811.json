The invoking chain is :  brcmf_usb_disconnect   ->brcmf_usb_disconnect_cb     ->brcmf_detach       ->brcmf_cfg80211_detach         ->kfree(cfg);  While the timeout woker may still be running. This will cause a use-after-free bug on cfg in brcmf_cfg80211_escan_timeout_worker.  Fix it by deleting the timer and canceling the worker in brcmf_cfg80211_detach.
