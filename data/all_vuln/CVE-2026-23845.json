Versions prior to 1.28.3 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via HTML Check CSS Download. The HTML Check feature (`/api/v1/message/{ID}/html-check`) is designed to analyze HTML emails for compatibility. During this process, the `inlineRemoteCSS()` function automatically downloads CSS files from external `<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"...\">` tags to inline them for testing. Version 1.28.3 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/axllent/mailpit","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"eac491cd897127de41b0e26210be93a041f836dd"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1-beta","0.0.2","0.0.3","0.0.4","0.0.5","0.0.6","0.0.7","0.0.8","0.0.9","0.1.0","0.1.1","0.1.2","0.1.3","0.1.4","0.1.5","1.0.0","1.0.0-beta1","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.2","1.1.3","1.1.4","1.1.5","1.1.7","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.2.4","1.2.5","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.10.3","v1.10.4","v1.11.0","v1.11.1","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.13.2","v1.13.3","v1.14.0","v1.14.1","v1.14.2","v1.14.3","v1.14.4","v1.15.0","v1.15.1","v1.16.0","v1.17.0","v1.17.1","v1.18.0","v1.18.1","v1.18.2","v1.18.3","v1.18.4","v1.18.5","v1.18.6","v1.18.7","v1.19.0","v1.19.1","v1.19.2","v1.19.3","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.2.9","v1.20.0","v1.20.1","v1.20.2","v1.20.3","v1.20.4","v1.20.5","v1.20.6","v1.20.7","v1.21.0","v1.21.1","v1.21.2","v1.21.3","v1.21.4","v1.21.5","v1.21.6","v1.21.7","v1.21.8","v1.22.0","v1.22.1","v1.22.2","v1.22.3","v1.23.0","v1.23.1","v1.23.2","v1.24.0","v1.24.1","v1.24.2","v1.25.0","v1.25.1","v1.26.0","v1.26.1","v1.26.2","v1.27.0","v1.27.1","v1.27.10","v1.27.11","v1.27.2","v1.27.3","v1.27.4","v1.27.5","v1.27.6","v1.27.7","v1.27.8","v1.27.9","v1.28.0","v1.28.1","v1.28.2","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.10","v1.3.11","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.3.7","v1.3.8","v1.3.9","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.5.5","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.10","v1.6.11","v1.6.12","v1.6.13","v1.6.14","v1.6.15","v1.6.16","v1.6.17","v1.6.18","v1.6.19","v1.6.2","v1.6.20","v1.6.21","v1.6.22","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.6.7","v1.6.8","v1.6.9","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.8.3","v1.8.4","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.10","v1.9.2","v1.9.3","v1.9.4","v1.9.5","v1.9.6","v1.9.7","v1.9.8","v1.9.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23845.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23845.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/commit/1679a0aba592ebc8487a996d37fea8318c984dfe"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/releases/tag/v1.28.3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/security/advisories/GHSA-6jxm-fv7w-rw5j"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23845"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-918"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23845.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
