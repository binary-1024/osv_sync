  "details": "The vulnerable-passwords script in Best Practical Solutions RT 3.x before 3.8.12 and 4.x before 4.0.6 does not update the password-hash algorithm for disabled user accounts, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to determine cleartext passwords, and possibly use these passwords after accounts are re-enabled, via a brute-force attack on the database.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-0009.",
