They are designed to &quot;export&quot; a frame buffer via net: you set up a server and can connect to it via VNC viewers. If the server supports WebSockets (which LibVNCServer does), you can also connect using an in-browser VNC viewer like noVNC. It is already in wide use for administration, but it is not that easy to program a server yourself.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\r\n\r\nlibvncclient v0.9.13 was discovered to contain a memory leak via the function rfbClientCleanup().(CVE-2020-29260)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libvncserver","ecosystem":"openEuler:22.03-LTS","purl":"pkg:rpm/openEuler/libvncserver&distro=openEuler-22.03-LTS"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.9.13-3.oe2203"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"aarch64":["libvncserver-debuginfo-0.9.13-3.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","libvncserver-devel-0.9.13-3.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","libvncserver-0.9.13-3.oe2203.aarch64.rpm","libvncserver-debugsource-0.9.13-3.oe2203.aarch64.rpm"],"src":["libvncserver-0.9.13-3.oe2203.src.rpm"],"x86_64":["libvncserver-debugsource-0.9.13-3.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","libvncserver-devel-0.9.13-3.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","libvncserver-0.9.13-3.oe2203.x86_64.rpm","libvncserver-debuginfo-0.9.13-3.oe2203.x86_64.rpm"]},"database_specific":{"source":"https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/osv/OESA-2022-2090.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/safety-bulletin/detail.html?id=openEuler-SA-2022-2090"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-29260"}],"database_specific":{"severity":"High"}}
